She was also the founder of St. Mary's Hospital, Rochester, Minnesota, which became part of the famed Mayo Clinic. Early life Born as Maria Catherine Moes in Remich, Luxembourg, she was the daughter of a prosperous ironsmith. She emigrated to America with her sister, Catherine, due to the preaching of Bishop John Henni of Milwaukee. Bishop Henni spoke of the need for teachers in the United States, especially among the Native Americans.\\"Our Founder\\", Sisters of St. Francis of Mary Immaculate There were also large immigrant communities, mostly German-speaking, establishing themselves there. Both were highly educated in music and arts. Besides their own Luxembourg language, they spoke and studied in French, German and English. They had also studied mathematics and architecture. The Moes sisters left a life of comfort and set sail from Le Havre, France on September 27, 1851, destined for New York City. From 1852-1863 they lived first in Wisconsin, with the School Sisters of Notre Dame in Milwaukee, then with the Marianites of Holy Cross in South Bend, Indiana. While there, the sisters took religious vows and assumed the names of Sister Alfred and Sister Barbara. When the option arose of leaving the Holy Cross Sisters, the Moes sisters, with two companions, were received into the Third Order of St. Francis, on June 1, 1863. Illinois At the invitation of the parish priest in Joliet, Illinois, the small group of four Sisters moved to that town the following November to begin teaching the local children. Lightning struck the Church of St. John the Baptist there on July 31, 1864, killing one parishioner, a young woman who left behind a family. The distraught widower asked the Sisters to care for his children. This unexpected work soon expanded, and the Sisters began to take in orphans, as well as boarding school students, and candidates to the community. The Sisters soon bought a larger house and established St. Francis Academy. During the summer of 1865, the Guardian of the Franciscan friars in the United States, Father Pamfilo da Magliano, O.S.F., summoned Sister Alfred to St. Bonaventure Friary, in Allegany County, New York, along with the first postulant to the community, Mary Ann Rosenberger. There he named Sister Alfred as the Superior General of the new congregation of the \\"Sisters of St. Francis of Mary Immaculate\\". At that time he bestowed the Franciscan habit on Rothenberger, who took the name Sister Angela. Until 1880, the order used the Constitution drafted for the Franciscan Sisters of Allegany, a congregation da Magliano had previously established. By 1869, the Sisters had built a new St. Francis Academy, teaching girls aged 3‚Äì20 and drawing students from across the nation. Pastors around the whole country sought the Sisters to come to their parishes to teach their children, especially in non-English-speaking populations. By 1874, the Sisters were teaching throughout five states, as far away as Tennessee. Minnesota Mother Alfred came to plan an even larger expansion of the academy. The local bishop opposed this idea and ordered the Sisters to replace her with a new Superior General. One of her first companions, Sister Alberta, accepted the post temporarily. She then assigned Mother Alfred to go to Rochester to build Our Lady of Lourdes School, at the request of the bishop there. Shortly after that school was opened, Bishop Foley of Joliet expelled Mother Alfred from the congregation. Bishop Grace of Minnesota chose to accept her vows. Mother Alfred's permanent successor as Superior General then informed the Congregation of her expulsion, and offered the Sisters ten days to decide if they wished to join Mother Alfred in Minnesota. Of the whole Congregation, 92 chose to remain in Joliet, while 25 chose to join Mother Alfred. This small group became the nucleus of a new congregation, the Sisters of St. Francis of O.L. of Lourdes.American Catholic website The Sisters began to open a series of successful schools. Following a tornado, which devastated the young city of Rochester in 1883, Mother Alfred saw the need for a hospital in the town. She proposed to Dr. William Worrall Mayo that the Sisters would operate a hospital for the injured and sick if he and his sons would serve as its physicians. Thus they opened St. Mary's Hospital on September 30, 1889. Today that hospital is a part of the Mayo Clinic.\\"History of Mayo Clinic Hospital, Saint Marys Campus\\", Mayo ClinicBelli, Luca. \\"Mayo Clinic in Rochester\\", Journal of Medicine and the Person, Settembre 2004, vol.2, numero 3 She died in 1899, aged 71.

The enrolment includes around 6,300 part-time learners and approximately 4,800 full-time students. A report following a January 2010 Ofsted inspection awarded the school a Grade 2 (good) that included a Grade 1 (outstanding) on 3 inspection criteria.Ofsted inspection report 2010 retrieved 29 July 2010 The college is a member of the Collab Group of high performing schools. About The college is a multi-centre establishment, with three campuses throughout North East England, these are Bede Campus, City Campus, and Washington Campus. In addition to Hartlepool Sixth Form. History Statistically, Sunderland College has held the top position of colleges and sixth forms in Sunderland - achieving the best grades locally in comparison with St. Aidan's RC, St. Anthony's RC and St. Robert's of Newminster, in recent years. Hartlepool Sixth Form merged with Sunderland College in September 2017 and in March 2019, Northumberland College merged with Sunderland College. This created Education Partnership North East, one of the largest college groups in the country. Bede Campus The college's Bede Campus, which is situated close to Sunderland City Centre on Durham Road (A690), is in the buildings of the former Bede School which began as Sunderland Higher Grade School in 1890 (near the West Park, now the site of Sunderland Civic Centre). In 1905 the school was renamed Bede Collegiate School, with separate Boys and Girls' Schools, and in 1927 the foundation stones were laid for new school buildings on Durham Road, current site of Bede Campus of Sunderland College. Following the 1944 Education Act the two schools became Grammar Schools: the Girls' School had around 500 girls in the 1950s, and by the 1960s the Boys' School had over 900 boys. In 1971 Bede School became a co-educational non-selective Comprehensive School, closing in 1991 a year after celebrating its centenary. Both the Boys' and Girls' Schools of the original school and the successor Comprehensive School were referred to, locally, as Bede School or 'The Bede'. Bede Campus is the specialist centre for health and care, digital, A-Levels, sports and visual and performing arts courses. It is home to a dedicated sixth form for academic study, science labs, health simulation ward, industry standard digital suite, state-of-the art Sports Academy and ¬£11 million Arts Academy. The campus also includes a Goals Soccer Centre with all-weather 3G 5-a-side pitches. City Campus In the heart of Sunderland, the ¬£30 million City Campus has an extensive range of industry-standard equipment for vocational study from specialist construction and engineering workshops to a simulated aircraft for Travel and Tourism students. In addition there is commercial hair, barbering and beauty salons, a travel agency, restaurant and kitchens. Washington Campus In September 2006, Sunderland College opened its brand-new ¬£10 million Washington campus on Stone Cellar Road in Washington, Tyne and Wear, which then won the award for Public Sector Building of the Year at The Journal Landmark Awards. It is on the site of the former Usworth School just off the A195 near the junction with the A194(M) in Usworth and Concord. Facilities Each of the college's centres has its own Learning Centre where students can have access to networked computers, borrow books from the library, or a quiet place to study. Refectories, cafes, shops and common rooms are all available at each of the campuses.

Gonzalo's kingdom is shown in green, the same colour as Aragon, which annexed it in 1043. (Click to enlarge.) Gonzalo S√°nchez ( 1020 ‚Äì 26 June 1043) was the king of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza, two small Pyrenean counties, from 1035 until his death. He was the son of King Sancho III of Navarre and his wife, Muniadona of Castile. Before his death in 1035, Sancho divided his kingdom between his sons, leaving Sobrarbe and Ribagorza to Gonzalo. He governed them as vassal of his elder brother, Garc√≠a S√°nchez III, who had inherited Navarre.In contemporary documents, sometimes both counties are named‚Äîdomino Gondesalbo in Suprabi et in Ripacorza‚Äîother times one is singled out and the other ignored. Gonzalo is thought to have been ineffectual and unpopular, with vassals defecting to his half-brother, Ramiro I of Aragon, during his own lifetime. Within a decade of his death, his reign was being ignored and he was left out of a list of rulers of Ribagorza. Reign On 14 April 1035, according to a document preserved in the monastery of San Juan de la Pe√±a, Sancho III granted Aragon to his eldest but illegitimate son Ramiro. In the same act the castle of Loarre and monastery of San Emeterio with their dependent villages were detached from Aragon and given to Gonzalo as part of his inheritance.P√©rez de Urbel, pp. 14‚Äì16. There is no indication that the brothers were on poor terms. Gonzalo subsequently confirmed many charters alongside his brother and they often appear together in dating clauses.On 25 May 1036, Gonzalo confirmed the donation by a certain Lady Blasquita to San Juan de la Pe√±a of the village of Ballar√°n with the dating clause \\"the lord king Ramiro reigning in Aragon and his brother Gonzalo in Sobrarbe\\" (regnante rex domino Ranimiri in Aragone et frater ejus Gondesalbus in Superarbi), cited in P√©rez de Urbel, p. 18. Gonzalo was present with all his brothers and his brother-in-law, King Vermudo III of Le√≥n, when Ramiro granted arras (a nuptial gift) to his future wife, Ermesinda of Bigorre on 22 August 1036. In Ramiro's charter recording the gift, Gonzalo is given the title of king. In 1037 Gonzalo joined his brothers Garc√≠a and Ramiro to confirm a donation of Jimeno Garc√©s, Ramiro's godfather, to the monastery of Leire. In this document Garc√≠a uses the title princeps (prince, from Latin for \\"foremost\\") to indicate his suzerainty over his brothers, while Ramiro and Gonzalo use the title regulus (petty king).In this document, both Ramiro and Gonzalo are referred to as ruling \\"in Aragon\\" (in Aragone). This meeting probably took place either in Leire or else in Garc√≠a's capital, Pamplona. Neither the day nor the month is preserved in the record. The use of a royal title, even one as low as regulus, in the presence of his suzerain, Garc√≠a, is strong evidence that Gonzalo did not usurp a royal title, but that Sancho III intended to create kingdoms for Gonzalo and Ramiro.Cf. P√©rez de Urbel, p. 19‚Äì20. Gonzalo joined all his brothers, including the youngest, Ferindand, at Anz√°nigo in 1037 (or perhaps as late as 1043), after Ferdinand had succeeded to the Kingdom of Le√≥n. Death Gonzalo's death on 26 June appears in the necrology of the Sobrarbean monastery of San Victori√°n, but the year is not recorded and has been the subject of much debate. The early modern historian Jer√≥nimo Zurita incorrectly placed it in 1035. Jos√© de Moret suggested 1042 or 1043. A late source, the Chronicle of San Juan de la Pe√±a, places it in 1037, but there is charter of disputed authenticity dated September 1039 that is confirmed by Gonzalo.P√©rez de Urbel, p. 22. This is a concession of Aznar At√≥n, lord of Tena, to Aldhelm, abbot of the Ribagorzan monastery of Ala√≥n, witnessed by Ramiro, Ermesinda and Count Raymond III of Pallars Juss√†. Its authenticity was denied by Ubieto Arteta. As Ramiro confirmed the rights of Bishops of Urgell in Ribagorza in September 1040, it would appear that Gonzalo was dead by then. P√©rez de Urbel thus places it between December 1039 and September 1040 and casts doubt on the dates of several documents mentioning Gonzalo after 1040 (a donation of Blasquita from 1041, a charter of Ramiro's from 1042, and a donation of Ramiro to At√≥n Garc√©s in 1043). Accepting these, Ubieto Arteta places Gonzalo's assassination in 1046. Nelson gives reason to believe that it was 1043.Nelson, pp. 230‚Äì31. The Chronicle of San Juan de la Pe√±a reports that Gonzalo was assassinated by one of his own knights, Ramonat de Uasconya,The name possibly indicates a Gascon. who threw him from the bridge over the river Esera at Montcl√∫s, near Lascorz.P√©rez de Urbel, p. 21. He was interred in the monastery of San Victori√°n.Nelson, pp. 228‚Äì29. On his death, Garc√≠a awarded his counties to Ramiro. Gonzalo left no heirs and his short reign was soon forgotten. The Historia silense, written around 1115, does not even mention him in its version of the division of Sancho III's realm. It even records that Ramiro was given the \\"remote\\" region of Aragon on account of his illegitimacy, despite the fact that Gonzalo's division was more remote than Aragon and his legitimacy unquestioned. The anonymous Chronica naierensis of about 1200, basing its account entirely on the Silense, likewise ignores Gonzalo and blames Ramiro's position on his illegitimacy.P√©rez de Urbel, pp. 4‚Äì5. The Liber regum, also from around 1200 but independent of the Silense, nevertheless shows no awareness of Gonzalo.P√©rez de Urbel, pp. 6‚Äì7.

It is a government-owned station that broadcasts in 13 languages around the world, with a majority emphasis on Mandarin and Taiwanese-language broadcasts over shortwave into China.  History  Central Broadcasting System microphone plate The Central Broadcasting System was founded in 1928 as the voice of the Kuomintang (KMT) government quartered in Nanking on mainland China. During the Second Sino- Japanese War the KMT was forced by Japanese advances to relocate the radio station, along with the capital city, first to Hankou in the central Hubei Province and then to Chungking in south-central China. After the conclusion of the Second World War, which saw the surrender and withdrawal of Japanese forces, the KMT and the Communist Party of China resumed their civil war. The defeated KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1949 and the Central Broadcasting System moved with them.  Current status  After undergoing restructuring during the period 1996‚Äì98, CBS broadcast to mainland China and the rest of the world under the call sign Radio Taipei International and the Voice of Asia. Radio Taipei International essentially replaced the international radio services of the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC), known as the Voice of Free China. Radio Taipei International broadcast to China and to an international audience; by contrast, the Voice of Asia was broadcast to the Asia-Pacific region only and offered a lighter format than RTI. In 2002 the Voice of Asia call sign was dropped to leave Radio Taipei International as the sole broadcasting name for the service. This was in turn changed to Radio Taiwan International, to avoid confusion on the part of listeners, who had trouble associating Taipei with Taiwan.Official Radio Taiwan International (RTI) Website . In addition, via domestic AM radio and shortwave, CBS also broadcast three different \\"networks\\" in Chinese (mainly Mandarin and Taiwanese) to the mainland. These networks were the News Network (a news and information- oriented service), the Variety Network (a music and features-oriented service, also known as the Mandarin Programme, Taiwanese Programme, Perspective Program, or the Pop Network Programme), and the Dialect Network (programming aimed at the minorities of China). In time, the Variety Network was renamed the General Network, the News Network became the Mainland Network, and eventually the Mainland, General, and Dialect Network were merged in with Radio Taiwan International. One consequence of this was that CBS could no longer broadcast domestically over AM radio.  Broadcasting details  Radio Taiwan International broadcasts to the following countries and regions: * Australia and New Zealand * China * Europe * Indonesia * Japan * Korea * The Philippines * South Africa * South Asia * Southeast Asia Programming is carried in Mandarin, Taiwanese, English, Hokkien, Cantonese, Hakka, Japanese, Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese, Spanish, German, French and Russian (previously also in Arabic, Burmese, Mongolian and Tibetan). As of 1 July 2013, RTI terminated its shortwave broadcasts to North and South America due to budget cuts caused by the closure of WYFR, a Christian religious shortwave station which RTI leased airtime from and whose Florida transmitter RTI used to broadcast to the Americas. RTI programming was broadcast on WYFR at 5.95 MHz and 9.61 MHz between 17:00 / 18:00 hrs. Eastern until 03:00 / 04:00http://english.rti.org.tw/thmeInfo4.aspx?tid=84557129E1CDFAD2 After that point, Family Radio continued to host RTI's audio service to the Chinese community in the New York City area on a digital subchannel of Family Radio's television station, WFME-TV; this would end in October 2013, when the station was revamped into an international ethnic station, WNYJ-TV.

The film stars Donald Duck, employed as a plumber, and Mickey's dog Pluto as his assistant. The film was directed by Ben Sharpsteen and featured the voice of Clarence Nash as Donald. Donald and Pluto is one of the three installments of the Mickey Mouse series in which Mickey does not appear as a character; the others are 1937's Don Donald and Modern Inventions. The cartoon also introduced Fred Spencer's new design for Donald Duck, which included a slimmer body, shorter neck, rounder feet, and a shorter bill. Plot Donald is a plumber fixing pipes in the basement of a house. Donald first has trouble with pulling his hammer off a magnet, which it gets stuck to. When he unscrews the lid covering the pipe, water spurts out and hits Donald in the face, angering him. To stop the flow, Donald uses the magnet to pull a larger hammer toward himself, which he uses to put on another lid to the hole. In doing so he accidentally wakes Pluto and later accidentally pulls Pluto's bone away from him. While Pluto wrestles with the magnet to get his bone back, he swallows the magnet and gets his bone stuck to his bottom. As he fights to get the bone, he tumbles into the pile of furniture Donald is standing on, causing Donald to come crashing to the ground. Pluto eventually runs into the kitchen and the magnet inside him causes many cooking items to be pulled onto his rear. Pluto's erratic actions eventually cause the dishes to fall off, but his bone continues getting stuck to him and annoying him. As he tries to get it off, he backs into the clock and gets stuck to it. After breaking free of the clock by destroying it, he pulls a much smaller alarm clock to him. He engages in a fight with the clock, soon realizing that if he makes minor movements along the wall rear-end first the clock will not come to him. However, he trips over a rolling pin and the clock sticks to him again, but he loses it in a polar bear rug. His dish sticks to him again and the magnetism causes knives and forks to come out of a drawer and chase him. The chase eventually causes Pluto to end up in the basement again. There, the magnet inside him sucks the nails out of the ladder Donald is standing on, causing it to fall apart under his feet. Donald falls into a tank and is pulled out through a wringer. After an angry outburst he gets stuck to Pluto's bottom and is dragged into the roof of the basement. Pluto is chased by the angry Donald through the house and onto the roof, where the magnetism causes Donald to be pulled into the roof and along the ceiling with the floor separating the two (it looks as if there is an invisible track Donald is hanging from). Donald is dragged into a ceiling fan, activating it and spinning both Donald and Pluto around. Donald gets an electric shock when he pulls out a lamp and is later bumped across the ceiling when Pluto crawls over a ladder. Pluto eventually makes his way downstairs where Donald falls to the ground and bounces back into the basement when he is pinned to the wall by his own tools. Pluto finds him and begins happily licking him as he squawks angrily.

It is based on The French Lieutenant's Woman, a 1969 novel by John Fowles. The music score is by Carl Davis and the cinematography by Freddie Francis. The film stars Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons. Other featured actors include Hilton McRae, Peter Vaughan, Colin Jeavons, Liz Smith, Patience Collier, Richard Griffiths, David Warner, Alun Armstrong, Penelope Wilton, and Leo McKern. The film received five Oscar nominations. Streep was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and Pinter for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Plot The film intercuts the stories of two romantic affairs. One is within a Victorian period drama involving a gentleman palaeontologist, Charles Smithson, and the complex and troubled Sarah Woodruff, known as \\"the French lieutenant's woman\\". The other affair is between the actors Mike and Anna, playing the lead roles in a modern filming of the story. In both segments, Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep play the lead roles. John Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman had multiple endings, and the two parallel stories in the movie have different outcomes. In the Victorian story, Charles enters into an intensely emotional relationship with Sarah, an enigmatic and self-imposed exile he meets just after becoming engaged to Ernestina (Lynsey Baxter), a rich merchant's daughter in Lyme Regis. Charles and Sarah meet secretly in the Lyme Regis Undercliff, and eventually have sex in an Exeter hotel. This leads to Charles's breaking his engagement, but then Sarah disappears. In social disgrace after being sued for breach of promise by Ernestina, Charles searches for Sarah, fearing she has become a prostitute in London. After three years, Sarah, who has a job as a governess in the Lake District, contacts Charles to explain that she needed time to find herself. Despite Charles's initial anger, he forgives her, and the two are reconciled. They are finally seen boating on Windermere. In the modern story, the American actress Anna and the English actor Mike, both married, are shown as having an extended affair during the making of the Victorian film, in which Anna plays Sarah and Mike portrays Charles. As filming concludes, Mike wishes to continue the relationship, but Anna becomes increasingly cool about the affair and avoids Mike in favour of spending time with her French husband. During the film's wrap party, Anna leaves without saying goodbye to Mike. Mike calls to Anna, using her character's name Sarah, from an upstairs window on the set where Charles and Sarah reconciled, as she drives away.

Leon had produced Reisz' Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment. The film was shot in 1980 on location in Lyme Regis, Dartmouth, Exeter, London docks, and Lake Windermere. Studio sets were built at Twickenham Studios in London to Assheton Gorton's period-perfect designs. The opening shot in the film establishes the dual stories by having the assistant director mark the shot with a clapper board, and then run out of the shot to reveal the Victorian seaside front, with Charles and Ernestina taking the air. The audience is given alternating sequences of a rigid Victorian society, and the more relaxed modern life of a working film crew, revealing the great moral divide between past and present. Prostitution, Considered in Its Moral, Social, and Sanitary Aspects, an 1857 book by William Acton, is referred to in the film when Streep's character mentions that in 1857 there were 80,000 prostitutes in the London and that one house in 60 functioned as a brothel. The book was published in 1969. Its transfer to the big screen was a protracted process, with film rights changing hands a number of times before a treatment, funds and cast were finalized. Originally, Malcolm Bradbury and Christopher Bigsby approached Fowles to suggest a television adaptation, to which Fowles was amenable, but the producer Saul Zaentz finally arranged for the film version to be made. A number of directors were attached to the film: Sidney Lumet, Robert Bolt, Fred Zinnemann and Milo≈° Forman. The script went through a number of treatments, including one by Dennis Potter in 1975 and by James Costigan in 1976, before Pinter's final draft. Actors considered for the role of Charles Smithson/Mike included Robert Redford and Richard Chamberlain, and Sarah/Anna included Francesca Annis, Charlotte Rampling, Gemma Jones and Fowles's choice Helen Mirren. The award-winning music was composed by Carl Davis and performed by an unidentified orchestra and viola soloist Kenneth Essex. Reception Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it \\"a beautiful film to look at, and remarkably well-acted\\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"an astonishingly beautiful film, acted to the elegant hilt by Meryl Streep as the ultimately unreliable Sarah; Jeremy Irons, who looks a lot like the young Laurence Olivier of 'Wuthering Heights,' as Charles Smithson, and by a cast of splendid supporting actors of the sort that only England seems to possess.\\"Canby, Vincent, \\"Screen: 'The French Lieutenant's Woman'\\", The New York Times,18 September 1981, C4.

It is a hybrid discipline involving aspects of transport engineering and traditional urban planning. Indeed, many transit planners find themselves involved in discourse with urban-land-use issues such as transit-oriented development. Transit planners are responsible for developing routes and networks of routes for urban transit systems. These may follow one or more models depending on the character of the communities they serve. For example, in urban areas, a system may attract enough ridership to support high frequencies of service. At these high frequencies, services can operate at demand service levels where the specific frequency of service in each corridor can be independent and where transfers can reasonably occur at random. In less densely developed areas service may operate somewhat infrequently. To optimize the quality of trips for customers, some systems compensate by operating a timed-transfer system. In this model, routes are designed to bring buses (or trains or ferries) together at a central location at predetermined times. Customers then transfer between the vehicles which leave a few minutes later. In systems committed to this system, routes are designed to take travel time into account. In addition to serving customers' transportation needs, transit planners often consider transportation projects' other impacts. Economic impacts, directly on providers and consumers, on local economies, and on the aggregate level in large economic spheres, often feature prominently in deciding between different projects. In recent decades, concerns about environmental quality have produced a growing interest in developing sustainable transportation and transit planning has evolved to reflect these new concerns. Similarly, impacts on social equity have been paid increasing attention by transit planners in recent years.

The text is preserved in the Royal Irish Academy as MS 679 (23/G/4), with a few early modern copies. It is a prophecy made in the Early Middle Ages. Composition The text consists of 205 ' stanzas, two of which are corrupt (128, 168). It is divided into two parts. The reputed author of part one (stanzas 1-96) is an Irish abbot named Berch√°n, from whom the poem's name originates. Part one consists of a history of Berch√°n's own monastery, a recount of Viking attacks, and descriptions of the reigns of nineteen Irish kings. Part two (stanzas 97‚Äì206) is presented as an anonymous prophecy given around the death of Saint Patrick in the 5th century, prophesying the life of Columba and King √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in, and 24 Scottish kings, from Cin√°ed mac Ailp√≠n (d. 858) to Domnall B√°n (d. 1097). The poem is very indirect in its identification of Scottish kings, and uses many obscure poetic images and similes. Unlike the Irish kings in part one, there are no accompanying glosses naming the kings. However, the Scottish kings spoken of can be identified, and the evidence made useful. The poem is one of the most important sources for Scottish history in the period it covers.

In Buddhism, the views on vegetarianism vary between different schools of thought. The Mahayana schools generally recommend a vegetarian diet because in some sutras the Buddha set forth that his followers not eat the flesh of any sentient being.Sutras on refraining from eating meat Early Buddhism The earliest surviving written accounts of Buddhism are the Edicts of Asoka written by King Asoka, a well-known Buddhist king who propagated Buddhism throughout Asia and is honored by both Theravada and Mahayana schools of Buddhism. The authority of the Edicts of Asoka as a historical record is suggested by the mention of numerous topics omitted as well as corroboration of numerous accounts found in the Theravada and Mahayana Tripitakas written down centuries later. Asoka Rock Edict 1 dated to c. 257 BCE mentions the prohibition of animal sacrifices in Asoka's Maurya Empire as well as his commitment to vegetarianism; however, whether the Sangha was vegetarian in part or in whole is unclear from these edicts. However, Asoka's personal commitment to, and advocating of, vegetarianism suggests Early Buddhism (at the very least for the layperson) most likely already had a vegetarian tradition (the details of what that entailed besides not killing animals and eating their flesh, were not mentioned, and therefore are unknown.)  Views of different schools  There is a divergence of views within Buddhism as to whether vegetarianism is required; with some schools of Buddhism rejecting such a requirement. Some Buddhists avoid meat consumption because of the first precept in Buddhism: \\"I undertake the precept to refrain from taking life\\". Other Buddhists disagree with this conclusion. Many Buddhist vegetarians also oppose meat-eating based on scriptural injunctions against flesh-eating recorded in Mahayana sutras. = Mahayana view = Mahayana views on vegetarianism are within the broader framework of Buddhist ethics or ≈öƒ´la. The aim of Buddhist vegetarianism is to give rise to compassion and the upholder of vegetarianism is expected to (at least faithfully attempt to) observe Buddhist ethics. The Buddhist vegetarian who does not observe Buddhist ethics is not seen as a true Buddhist vegetarian. According to the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra giving Gautama Buddha's final teachings, the Buddha insisted that his followers should not eat any kind of meat or fish. Even vegetarian food that has been touched by meat should be washed before being eaten. Also, it is not permissible for the monk or nun just to pick out the non-meat portions of a diet - the whole meal must be rejected.Buddhism & Vegetarianism The A·πÖgulimƒÅlƒ´ya S≈´tra quotes a dialogue between Gautama Buddha and Manjushri on meat eating: The Buddha in certain Mahayana sutras very vigorously and unreservedly denounced the eating of meat, mainly on the grounds that such an act is linked to the spreading of fear amongst sentient beings (who can allegedly sense the odor of death that lingers about the meat-eater and who consequently fear for their own lives) and violates the bodhisattva's fundamental cultivation of compassion. Moreover, according to the Buddha in the A·πÖgulimƒÅlƒ´ya S≈´tra, since all beings share the same \\"Dhatu\\" (spiritual Principle or Essence) and are intimately related to one another, killing and eating other sentient creatures is tantamount to a form of self-killing and cannibalism. The sutras which inveigh against meat-eating include the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra, the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra, the BrahmajƒÅla S≈´tra, the A·πÖgulimƒÅlƒ´ya S≈´tra, the Mahamegha Sutra, and the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra. In the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra, which presents itself as the final elucidatory and definitive Mahayana teachings of the Buddha on the very eve of his death, the Buddha states that \\"the eating of meat extinguishes the seed of Great Kindness\\", adding that all and every kind of meat and fish consumption (even of animals found already dead) is prohibited by him. He specifically rejects the idea that monks who go out begging and receive meat from a donor should eat it: \\"[I]t should be rejected... I say that even meat, fish, game, dried hooves and scraps of meat left over by others constitutes an infraction... I teach the harm arising from meat-eating.\\" The Buddha also predicts in this sutra that later monks will \\"hold spurious writings to be the authentic Dharma\\" and will concoct their own sutras and falsely claim that the Buddha allows the eating of meat, whereas he says he does not. A long passage in the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra shows the Buddha speaking out very forcefully against meat consumption and unequivocally in favor of vegetarianism, since the eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said by him to be incompatible with the compassion that a Bodhisattva should strive to cultivate. This passage has been seen as questionable by a small minority of Mahayana Buddhist monastics (i.e. D.T. Suzuki). In several other Mahayana scriptures, too (e.g., the Mahayana jataka tales), the Buddha is seen clearly to indicate that meat- eating is undesirable and karmically unwholesome. Some suggest that the rise of monasteries in Mahayana tradition to be a contributing factor in the emphasis on vegetarianism. In the monastery, food was prepared specifically for monastics. In this context, large quantities of meat would have been specifically prepared (killed) for them. Henceforth, when monastics from the Indian geographical sphere of influence migrated to China from the year 65 CE on, they met followers who provided them with money instead of food. From those days onwards, Chinese monastics, and others who came to inhabit northern countries, cultivated their own vegetable plots and bought food in the market.‰ΩõÊïôÁöÑÊú¨Áõ∏ (‰∏ã)„ÄäÂ≠∏‰ΩõÁ¥†È£üËàáÂÅ•Â∫∑Èï∑Â£Ω„Äã This remains the dominant practice in China, Vietnam, and most Korean Mahayana temples; the exceptions being some Korean Mahayana temples who traced their lineages back to Japan. Mahayana lay Buddhists often eat vegetarian diets on the vegetarian dates (ÈΩãÊúü zhƒÅi qƒ´). There are different arrangement of the dates, from several days to three months in each year, in some traditions, the celebration of the bodhisattva Avalokite≈õvara's birthday, Bodhi Day and Great Renunciation days hold the highest importance to be vegetarian.„ÄäÂú∞ËóèËè©Ëê®ÂçÅÊñãÊó•„Äã = Theravada View = The most clear reference in Theravada Buddhism to monastic consumption of non- vegetarian food is found in the Pali Canon, where the Buddha once explicitly refused a suggestion by Devadatta to mandate vegetarianism in the monks' Vinaya monastic code. This refusal to proscribe non-vegetarian food is within the context of Buddhist monastics receiving alms food. The Buddha in the A·πÖguttara NikƒÅya 3.38 Sukhamala Sutta, before his enlightenment, describes his family being wealthy enough to provide non-vegetarian meals even to his servants. After becoming enlightened, he respectfully accepted any kind of alms food offered with good intention, including meat (within the limitations described above) , fruit and vegetables.Dharma Data: Vegetarianism In the modern era, the passage cited below has been interpreted as allowing the consumption of meat if it is not specifically slaughtered for the monastic receiving alms food: Also in the Jivaka Sutta, Buddha instructs a monk or nun to accept, without any discrimination, whatever alms food is offered with good will, including meat. In contrast, the Buddha in the Vanijja Sutta, AN 5:177 declares the meat trade to be one of the five wrong livelihood a layperson should not engage in : But this is not, strictly speaking, a dietary rule because the Buddha, on one particular occasion, specifically refused suggestions by Devadatta to institute vegetarianism in the Sangha.\\"Buddhism and Vegetarianism, The Rationale for the Buddha's Views on the Consumption of Meat\\" by Dr V. A. Gunasekara\\" 'The rule of vegetarianism was the fifth of a list of rules which Devadatta had proposed to the Buddha. Devadatta was the founder of the tapasa movement in Buddhism and his special rules involved ascetic and austere practices (forest-dwelling, wearing only rags, etc). The Buddha rejected all the proposed revisions of Devadatta, and it was in this context that he reiterated the tikoiparisuddha rule. (On this see the author's Western Buddhism and a Theravada heterodoxy, BSQ Tracts on Buddhism' In the Amagandha Sutta in the Sutta Nipata, a vegetarian Brahmin confronts Kassapa Buddha (a previous Buddha before Gautama Buddha) in regard to the evil of eating meat. The Brahmin insisted his higher status is well-deserved due to his observance of a vegetarian diet. The Buddha countered the argument by listing acts which cause real moral defilement (i.e. those acts in opposition to Buddhist ethics) and then stating the mere consumption of meat is not equivalent to those acts. There were monastic guidelines prohibiting consumption of 10 types of meat: that of humans, elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears and hyenas. This is because these animals (allegedly) can be provoked by the smell of the flesh of their own kind, or because eating of such flesh would generate a bad reputation for the Sangha. Paul Breiter, a student of Ajahn Chah, states that some bhikkhus in the Thai Forest Tradition choose to be vegetarian and that Ajahn Sumedho encouraged supporters to prepare vegetarian food for the temple. There are a significant minority of Theravada laypersons who practice vegetarianism especially in Thailand. = Vajrayana = Some Vajrayana practitioners both drink alcoholMindful Drinking?Buddhism and Alcohol and eat meat.The Maitreya Sangha Way Teaching on Not Eating Meat by His Holiness 17th Gyalwang Karmapa Many traditions of the Ganachakra which is a type of Panchamakara puja prescribed the offering and ingestion of meat and alcohol, although this practice is now often only a symbolic one, with no actual meat or alcohol ingested. One of the most important tert√∂ns of Tibet, Jigme Lingpa, wrote of his great compassion for animals: In The Life of Shabkar, the Autobiography of a Tibetan Yogin, Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol wrote: The 14th Dalai Lama and other esteemed lamas invite their audiences to adopt vegetarianism when they can. When asked in recent years what he thinks of vegetarianism, the 14th Dalai Lama has said: \\"It is wonderful. We must absolutely promote vegetarianism.\\"Buddha Heart, Buddha Mind, 2000 The Dalai Lama tried becoming a vegetarian and promoted vegetarianism.Vegetarian Awakening in the Himalayas In 1999, it was published that the Dalai Lama would only be vegetarian every other day and partakes of meat regularly.To be or not to be a vegetarian When he is in Dharamsala, he is vegetarian, but not necessarily when he is outside Dharamsala.A Routine Day of HH The Dalai Lama Paul McCartney has taken him to task for this and wrote to him to urge him to return to strict vegetarianism, but \\"[The Dalai Lama] replied [to me] saying that his doctors had told him he needed [meat], so I wrote back saying they were wrong.\\" Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche became vegetarian in 2008. Arjia Rinpoche became vegetarian in 1999.Arjia Lobsang Thubten Rinpoche (1950 - ) On 3 January 2007, one of the two 17th Karmapa, Urgyen Trinley Dorje, strongly urged vegetarianism upon his students, saying that generally, in his view, it was very important in the Mahayana not to eat meat and that even in Vajrayana students should not eat meat: > There are many great masters and very great realized beings in India and > there have been many great realized beings in Tibet also, but they are not > saying, \\"I'm realized, therefore I can do anything; I can eat meat and drink > alcohol.\\" It's nothing like that. It should not be like that. According to > the Kagyupa school, we have to see what the great masters of the past, the > past lamas of Kagyupas, did and said about eating meat. The Drikung Shakpa > [sp?] Rinpoche, master of Drikungpa, said like this, \\"My students, whomever > are eating or using meat and calling it tsokhor or tsok, then these people > are completely deserting me and going against the dharma.\\" I can't explain > each of these things, but he said that anybody that is using meat and saying > it is something good, this is completely against the dharma and against me > and they completely have nothing to do with dharma. He said it very, very > strongly.Talk on Vegetarianism by Orgyen Trinle Dorje, Karmapa XVII  Common practices  = Theravada = In the modern world, attitudes toward vegetarianism vary by location. In Sri Lanka and the Theravada countries of South East Asia, monks are obliged by the vinaya to accept almost any food that is offered to them, including meat, unless they suspect the meat was slaughtered specifically for them. = Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Taiwanese traditions = In China, Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan and their respective diaspora communities, monks and nuns are expected to abstain from meat and, traditionally, eggs and dairy, in addition to the fetid vegetables ‚Äì traditionally garlic, Allium chinense, asafoetida, shallot, and Allium victorialis (victory onion or mountain leek), although in modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the onion genus, as well as coriander ‚Äì this is called pure vegetarianism or veganism (Á¥îÁ¥† ch√∫n s√π). Pure Vegetarianism or Veganism is Indic in origin and is still practiced in India by some adherents of Dharmic religions such as Jainism and in the case of Hinduism, lacto-vegetarianism with the additional abstention of pungent or fetid vegetables. A minority of Buddhist lay believers are year- long vegetarians in the monastic way. Many lay followers followed monastic style vegetarianism on Lunar New Year's Eve, Saints days and ancestral feast days as well as the 1st and 15th day of the lunar calendar. Some lay followers also followed monastic style vegetarianism on the six-day, ten-dayÔºåGuan-yin (Avalokitesvara) vegetarian, etc., set lunar calendar schedule. Other Buddhist lay-followers also follow less stringent forms of vegetarianism. Most Buddhist lay-followers however are not vegetarians. Some Zhaijiao lay adherents also do not eat any meat. = Japanese traditions = Japan initially received Chinese Buddhism in the 6th century. In the 9th century, Emperor Saga made a decree prohibiting meat consumption, except that of fish and birds. Around the 9th century, two Japanese monks (K≈´kai and Saich≈ç), introduced Vajrayana Buddhism into Japan, and this soon became the dominant Buddhism among the nobility. In particular, Saich≈ç, who founded the Tendai sect of Japanese Buddhism, reduced the number of vinaya code to 66. (ÂÜÜÊàí yu√°n ji√®) During the 12th century, a number of monks from Tendai sects founded new schools (Zen, Pure Land Buddhism) and de-emphasised vegetarianism. Nichiren Buddhism today likewise deemphasises vegetarianism. Zen does tend generally to look favourably upon vegetarianism. Shingon Buddhism, founded by K≈´kai, recommends vegetarianism and requires it at certain times, but it is not always strictly required for monks and nuns. In 1872 of the Meiji restoration, as part of the opening up of Japan to Western influence, Emperor Meiji lifted the ban on the consumption of red meat.John Toland. Rising Sun, 1970. . The removal of the ban encountered resistance and in one notable response, ten monks attempted to break into the Imperial Palace. The monks asserted that due to foreign influence, large numbers of Japanese had begun eating meat and that this was \\"destroying the soul of the Japanese people.\\" Several of the monks were killed during the break-in attempt, and the remainder were arrested. = Tibetan traditions = In Tibet, where vegetables historically have been scarce, and the adopted vinaya was the Nikaya SarvƒÅstivƒÅda, vegetarianism is rare, although the Dalai Lama, the Karmapa, and other esteemed lamas invite their audiences to adopt vegetarianism whenever they can. Chatral Rinpoche in particular stated that anyone who wished to be his student must be vegetarian. Contradictory to the compassionate Tibetan Buddhist traditions in which a sanctity of life, both human and animal, is cherished, meat is often consumed as a form of sustenance due to lack of vegetation readily available. For example, Tibetan medicine emphasizes the necessity to acquire and sustain a balance between the bodily fluids of wind (rlung), phlegm (bad kan), and bile (mkhns), in which a meatless diet would disturb and eventually lead to fatigue.

Mo-Ti, a Chinese philosopher circa 500 BC, pondered the phenomenon of inverted light from the outside world beaming through a small hole in the opposite wall in a darkened room. Shadow plays first appeared during the Han Dynasty and later gain popularity across Asia. Around 180 AD, Ting Huan (‰∏ÅÁ∑©) created an elementary zoetrope in China. In 1021, Alhazen, an Iraqi scientist, experimented with the same optical principle described by Mo-Ti, and wrote of the results in his Book of Optics, which provided the first clear descriptionDavid H.

The first short films produced in Japan were Bake Jizo (Jizo the Spook) and Shinin no Sosei (Resurrection of a Corpse), both from 1898. The first Indian short film was also produced in 1898, The Flower of Persia, directed by Hiralal Sen. In the early 1900s, Israeli silent movies were screened in sheds, cafes and other temporary structures. In 1905, Cafe Lorenz opened on Jaffa Road in the Jewish neighborhood of Neve Tzedek. From 1909, the Lorenz family began screening movies at the cafe. In 1925, the Kessem Cinema was housed there for a short time. The first East Asian feature film was Japan's The Life Story of Tasuke Shiobara (1912). It was followed by India's first feature-length silent film, the period piece drama Raja Harishchandra (1913), by Dadasaheb Phalke, considered the father of Indian cinema. By the next decade, the output of Indian cinema was an average of 27 films per year. On the other hand, in the Philippines, the first film produced and made in the Philippines was La Vida de Jose Rizal in 1912 by Edward Meyer Gross. Jos√© Nepomuceno, bought his first film equipment from Albert Yearsley and Edward Meyer Gross on May 15, 1917 and for the next two years, Nepomuceno practiced using the equipment in preparation for making the first locally produced feature film of the Philippines. The first locally produced film in the Philippines is Dalagang Bukid. The film was released with English, Spanish, and Tagalog subtitles. During its theatrical run, leading actress Atang de la Rama had to sing Nabasag ang Banga (a song which is a part of the film) for every screening of the film in Manila, along with three others playing a violin, a cornet, and a piano In the 1920s, the newborn Soviet cinema was the most radically innovative. There, the craft of editing, especially, surged forward, going beyond its previous role in advancing a story. Sergei Eisenstein perfected the technique of so-called dialectical or intellectual montage, which strove to make non-linear, often violently clashing, images express ideas and provoke emotional and intellectual reactions in the viewer. Jewish cinema, particularly the Yiddish theater of Ashkenazi Jews, made its mark from the 1930s onward. Over 100 films were made in Yiddish, although many are now lost. Prominent films included Shulamith (1931), the first Yiddish musical on film His Wife's Lover (1931), A Daughter of Her People (1932), the anti-Nazi film The Wandering Jew (1933), The Yiddish King Lear (1934), Shir Hashirim (1935), the biggest Yiddish film hit of all time Yidl Mitn Fidl (1936), Where Is My Child? (1937), Green Fields (1937), Dybuk (1937), The Singing Blacksmith (1938), Tevya (1939), Mirele Efros (1939), Lang ist der Weg (1948), and God, Man and Devil (1950). Additionally, the films of the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen have left a lasting mark on cinema. =Early sound era= Sound films began being produced in Asia from the 1930s. Notable early talkies from the cinema of Japan included Kenji Mizoguchi's Sisters of the Gion (Gion no shimai, 1936), Osaka Elegy (1936) and The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums (1939), along with Sadao Yamanaka's Humanity and Paper Balloons (1937) and Mikio Naruse's Wife, Be Like A Rose! (Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni, 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S. However, with increasing censorship, the left-leaning tendency films of directors such as Daisuke Ito also began to come under attack. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature- length talkie was Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato (1930), which used the 'Mina Talkie System'. In 1935, Yasujir≈ç Ozu also directed An Inn in Tokyo, considered a precursor to the neorealism genre. Ardeshir Irani released Alam Ara, the first Indian talking film, on March 14, 1931. Following the inception of 'talkies' in India some film stars were highly sought after and earned comfortable incomes through acting. As sound technology advanced the 1930s saw the rise of music in Indian cinema with musicals such as Indra Sabha and Devi Devyani marking the beginning of song-and-dance in India's films.Burra & Rao, 253 Studios emerged across major cities such as Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai as filmmaking became an established craft by 1935, exemplified by the success of Devdas, which had managed to enthrall audiences nationwide.Burra & Rao, 254 =Golden Age= Following the end of World War II by the mid-1940s, the period from the late 1940s to the 1960s is considered the 'Golden Age' of Asian cinema. Many of the most critically acclaimed Asian films of all time were produced during this period, including Yasujir≈ç Ozu's Late Spring (1949) and Tokyo Story (1953); Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950), Ikiru (1952), Seven Samurai (1954) and Throne of Blood (1957); Kenji Mizoguchi's The Life of Oharu (1952), Sansho the Bailiff (1954) and Ugetsu (1954); Satyajit Ray's The Apu Trilogy (1955‚Äì1959), The Music Room (1958) and Charulata (1964); Guru Dutt's Pyaasa (1957) and Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959); and Fei Mu's Spring in a Small Town (1948), Raj Kapoor's Awaara (1951), Mikio Naruse's Floating Clouds (1955), Mehboob Khan's Mother India (1957), and Ritwik Ghatak's Subarnarekha (1962). During Japanese cinema's 'Golden Age' of the 1950s and 1960s, successful films included Rashomon (1950), Seven Samurai (1954) and The Hidden Fortress (1958) by Akira Kurosawa, as well as Yasujir≈ç Ozu's Tokyo Story (1953) and Ishir≈ç Honda's Godzilla (1954).Dave Kehr, Anime, Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age, The New York Times, January 20, 2002. These films have had a profound influence on world cinema. In particular, Kurosawa's Seven Samurai has been remade several times as Western films, such as The Magnificent Seven (1960) and Battle Beyond the Stars (1980), and has also inspired several Bollywood films, such as Sholay (1975) and China Gate (1998). Rashomon was also remade as The Outrage (1964), and inspired films with \\"Rashomon effect\\" storytelling methods, such as Andha Naal (1954), The Usual Suspects (1995) and Hero (2002). The Hidden Fortress was also the inspiration behind George Lucas' Star Wars (1977). The Japanese New Wave began in the late 1950s and continued into the 1960s. Other famous Japanese filmmakers from this period include Kenji Mizoguchi, Mikio Naruse, Hiroshi Inagaki and Nagisa Oshima. Japanese cinema later became one of the main inspirations behind the New Hollywood movement of the 1960s to 1980s. During Indian cinema's 'Golden Age' of the 1950s and 1960s, it was producing 200 films annually, while Indian independent films gained greater recognition through international film festivals. One of the most famous was The Apu Trilogy (1955‚Äì1959) from critically acclaimed Bengali film director Satyajit Ray, whose films had a profound influence on world cinema, with directors such as Akira Kurosawa, Martin Scorsese, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, Fran√ßois Truffaut, Steven Spielberg, Carlos Saura, Jean-Luc Godard, Isao Takahata, Gregory Nava, Ira Sachs, Wes Anderson and Danny Boyle being influenced by his cinematic style. According to Michael Sragow of The Atlantic Monthly, the \\"youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy\\". Subrata Mitra's cinematographic technique of bounce lighting also originates from The Apu Trilogy. Satyajit Ray's success led to the establishment of the 'Parallel Cinema' movement, which was at its peak during the 1950s and 1960s. Other famous Indian filmmakers from this period include Guru Dutt, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Bimal Roy, K. Asif and Mehboob Khan. The cinema of China experienced a 'Golden Age' in the late 1940s. In 1946, Cai Chusheng returned to Shanghai to revive the Lianhua name as the \\"Lianhua Film Society.\\" This in turn became Kunlun Studios which would go on to become one of the most important Chinese studios of the era, putting out the classics, Myriads of Lights (1948), The Spring River Flows East (1947), and Crows and Sparrows (1949). Wenhua's romantic drama Spring in a Small Town (1948), a film by director Fei Mu shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, with it being named by the Hong Kong Film Awards in 2004 as the greatest Chinese-language film ever made. The cinema of Malaysia also had its 'Golden Age' in the post-war period of the 1950s and 1960s. The period saw the introduction of the studio system of filmmaking in Malaysia and influx of influences from Hollywood, the emerging cinema of Hong Kong, and particularly the Indian and Japanese film industries which were themselves experiencing a Golden Age. The cinema of South Korea also experienced a 'Golden Age' in the late 1950s and 1960s, beginning with director Lee Kyu-hwan's tremendously successful remake of Chunhyang-jon (1955). That year also saw the release of Yangsan Province by the renowned director, Kim Ki-young, marking the beginning of his productive career. Both the quality and quantity of filmmaking had increased rapidly by the end of the 1950s. South Korean films, such as Lee Byeong-il's 1956 comedy Sijibganeun nal (The Wedding Day), had begun winning international awards. In contrast to the beginning of the 1950s, when only 5 movies were made per year, 111 films were produced in South Korea in 1959. The year 1960 saw the production of Kim Ki-young's The Housemaid and Yu Hyun-mok's Aimless Bullet, both of which have been listed among the best Korean films ever made.Min, p.46. The late 1950s and 1960s was also a 'Golden Age' for Philippine cinema, with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the local film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to earn recognition abroad. One such honor was bestowed to Manuel Conde's immortal movie Gengis Khan (1950) when it was accepted for screening at the 13th Venice Film Festival. Other awards include Gerardo de Leon's \\"Ifugao\\" (1954) and Lamberto Avellana's \\"Anak Dalita\\". By the end of the decade Philippine cinema had developed into a major force in the Asian region. The premiere Philippine directors of the era included Gerardo de Leon, Gregorio Fernandez, Eddie Romero, Lamberto Avellana, and Cirio Santiago.Is the Curtain Finally Falling on the Philippine Kovie Industry?. Accessed January 25, 2009.Aenet: Philippine Film History. Accessed January 22, 2009. The 1960s is often cited as being the 'golden age' of Pakistani cinema. Many A-stars were introduced in this period in time and became legends on the silver screen. As black-and-white became obsolete, Pakistan saw the introduction of its first colour films, the first being Munshi Dil's Azra in early 1960s, Zahir Rehan's Sangam (first full- length coloured film) in 1964, and Mala (first coloured cinemascope film). In 1961, the political film Bombay Wallah was released, based on the city of Bombay in neighbouring India, in the wake of the growing tension between the nations. In 1962, Shaheed (Martyr) pronounced the Palestine issue on the silver screen and became an instant hit, leading to a changing tide in the attitude of filmmakers. The 1960s was the \\"golden age\\" of Cambodian cinema. Several production companies were started and more movie theaters were built throughout the country. More than 300 movies were made in Cambodia during the era.\\"Cambodian films are undergoing a rebirth\\", Associated Press, January 6, 2006. (Retrieved from Taipei Times website on December 24, 2006.) A number of Khmer language films were well received in its neougbouring countries at the time. , NEWSGROUP. Among the classic films from Cambodia during this period were Lea Haey Duong Dara (Goodbye Duong Dara) and Pos Keng Kang (The Snake King's Wife) by Tea Lim Kun and Sabbseth, and An Euil Srey An (Khmer After Angkor) by Ly Bun Yim. The range of Jewish entrepreneurs in the American film industry is considerable: Samuel Goldwyn, Louis B. Mayer, the Warner Brothers, David O. Selznick, Marcus Loew, and Adolph Zukor, Fox, and so forth. A more specifically Jewish sensibility can be seen in the films of the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, or Woody Allen; other examples of specifically Jewish films from the Hollywood film industry are the Barbra Streisand vehicle Yentl (1983), or John Frankenheimer's The Fixer (1968). In 1966, 2.6 million Israelis went to the cinema over 50 million times. From 1968, when television broadcasting began, theaters began to close down, first in the periphery, then in major cities. 330 standalone theaters were torn down or redesigned as multiplex theaters. =Modern era= By the late '60s and early '70s, Japanese cinema had begun to become seriously affected by the collapse of the studio system. As Japanese cinema slipped into a period of relative low visibility, the cinema of Hong Kong entered a dramatic renaissance of its own, largely a side effect of the development of the wuxia blending of action, history, and spiritual concerns. Several major figures emerged in Hong Kong at this time - perhaps most famously, King Hu, whose 1966 Come Drink With Me was a key influence upon many subsequent Hong Kong cinematic developments. Shortly thereafter, the American-born Bruce Lee became a global icon in the 1970s. From 1969 onwards, the Iranian New Wave led to the growth of Iranian cinema, which would later go on to achieve international acclaim in the 1980s and 1990s. The most notable figures of the Iranian New Wave are Abbas Kiarostami, Jafar Panahi, Majid Majidi, Bahram Beizai, Darius Mehrjui, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Masoud Kimiay, Sohrab Shahid-Saless, Parviz Kimiavi, Samira Makhmalbaf, Amir Naderi, and Abolfazl Jalili. Features of New Wave Iranian film, in particular the works of Kiarostami, have been classified by some as postmodern. The 1970s also saw the establishment of Bangladeshi cinema following the country's independence in 1971. One of the first films produced in Bangladesh after independence was Titash Ekti Nadir Naam (A River Called Titas) in 1973 by acclaimed director Ritwik Ghatak, whose stature in Bengali cinema is comparable to that of Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen. Another great film of Bangladesh is Mita's 'Lathial' (The striker), were the best movies of the year of 1975. 'Lathial' got first National Award as the best film, and mita got first National Award as best director. In the cinema of India, the 1970s saw a decline in 'Parallel Cinema' and the rise of commercial Hindi cinema in the form of enduring masala films, a genre largely pioneered by screenwriter duo Salim‚ÄìJaved, with films such as the Mumbai underworld crime drama Deewaar (1975) and the \\"Curry Western\\" movie Sholay (1975), which solidified Amitabh Bachchan's position as a lead actor. Commercial cinema further grew throughout the 1980s and the 1990s with the release of films such as Mr. India (1987), Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988), Tezaab (1988), Chandni (1989), Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), Baazigar (1993), Darr (1993), Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) and Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge (1995).Rajadhyaksa, 688 By this time, the term \\"Bollywood\\" was coined to refer to the Hindi-language Bombay (now Mumbai) film industry. The most successful Indian actors between the 1990s and the 2010s are Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar, Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan. During the 1980s, Japanese cinema - aided by the rise of independent filmmaking and the spectacular success of anime - began to make something of an international comeback. Simultaneously, a new post-Mao Zedong generation of Chinese filmmakers began to gain global attention. Another group of filmmakers, centered around Edward Yang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, launched what has become known as the \\"Taiwanese New Wave\\". The 1980s is also considered the Golden Age of Hong Kong action cinema. Jackie Chan reinvented the martial arts film genre with a new emphasis on elaborate and dangerous stunts and slapstick humour, beginning with Project A (1983). John Woo began the \\"heroic bloodshed\\" genre based on triads, beginning with A Better Tomorrow (1986). The Hong Kong New Wave also occurred during this period, led by filmmakers such as Tsui Hark. With the post-1980 rise in popularity of East Asian cinema in the West, Western audiences are again becoming familiar with many of the industry's filmmakers and stars. A number of these key players, such as Chow Yun-fat and Zhang Ziyi, have \\"crossed over\\", working in Western films. Others have gained exposure through the international success of their films, though many more retain more of a \\"cult\\" appeal, finding a degree of Western success through DVD sales rather than cinema releases. In the modern era, the success of Israeli and diaspora Jewish cinema can be observed in industry giants ranging from Michael Ovitz, Michael Eisner, Lew Wasserman, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen. However, few of these ever focused on Jewish issues with the sometime exception of Spielberg. In the first decade of the 21st century, several Israeli films won awards in film festivals around the world. Prominent films of this period include Late Marriage (Dover Koshashvili), Broken Wings, Walk on Water and Yossi & Jagger (Eytan Fox), Nina's Tragedies, Campfire and Beaufort (Joseph Cedar), Or (My Treasure) (Keren Yedaya), Turn Left at the End of the World (Avi Nesher), The Band's Visit (Eran Kolirin) Waltz With Bashir (Ari Folman), and Ajami.

It is less than a half-mile from the North Carolina/Virginia border just outside Milton, North Carolina, on the banks of the Dan River. VIR hosts amateur and professional automobile and motorcycle events, driving schools, club days, and private test rentals. Track description VIR offers six track configurations, of which two can be run simultaneously. The \\"Full Course\\" is 3.27 miles in length while the \\"Patriot Course\\" stretches for 1.1 miles entirely inside the Full Course. The \\"North Course\\" is 2.25 miles long and the \\"South Course\\" covers a distance of 1.65 miles. Both consist of a portion of the \\"Full Course\\" and short connecting sections that connect to portions of the \\"Patriot Course\\" to produce the two courses that can run simultaneously. There is a second pit complex that is used only when running the \\"South Course\\". The longest configuration, \\"Grand East Course\\", is 4.2 miles long, and combines most of the \\"Full Course\\" and most of the \\"Patriot Course\\" by means of two of the short sections of connecting track used to make the \\"South Course\\" and \\"North Course\\". There is also another, seldom run, long configuration called the \\"Grand West Course\\" that uses the other two short connecting sections between the \\"Full Course\\" and the \\"Patriot Course.\\" Car and Driver magazine has an annual test of fast cars called \\"The Lightning Lap\\" using the \\"Grand West Course\\". Since the Patriot course is contained completely inside the Full Course, they can be run simultaneously. The \\"Full Course\\" is the most common configuration. One of the most notable sections of the course, second only to \\"Oak Tree\\" (T11), are the \\"Climbing Esses\\" which consist of an initial left up-hill (T7), followed by a right which crests at the apex then dropping slightly into a left (T8) which again crests at the apex dropping slightly, and then up into a final left (T9). The complexity and difficulty of this section is multiplied by the incredible entry speed because of a straight section leading into the Climbing Esses. This is followed by a cresting blind left hand turn (T10), \\"South Bend\\", that finishes in a steep downward slope. Another signature section is the \\"Roller Coaster\\" (T14) which is a scaled-down mirror image to the famed \\"Corkscrew\\" at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. There are two main straights on the track. The front straight is approximately 3000 ft long while the back straight is approximately 4000 ft long. While the back straight is 33% longer, the front straight is where higher speeds are reached since \\"Hog Pen\\" (T17) leads onto it and is a much faster corner than \\"Oak Tree\\" (T11), which leads onto the longer back straight. There is 130 ft of elevation change throughout the course. Some of the raceway's other named curves include \\"Oak Tree\\", \\"Horse Shoe\\", \\"NASCAR Bend\\" (because NASCAR drivers Richard Petty, David Pearson and Wendell Scott had difficulties there during a 1966 Trans Am race), \\"Snake\\", \\"Spiral\\", \\"Fish Hook\\", and \\"The Bitch\\". =Other configurations= File:Virginia International Raceway - Grand East Course.svgGrand East Course 4.20 mi (6.76 km) 25 turns File:Virginia International Raceway - Grand West Course.svgGrand West Course 4.10 mi (6.60 km) 28 turns File:Virginia International Raceway - North Course.svgNorth Course 2.25 mi (3.62 km) 17 turns File:Virginia International Raceway - South Course.svgSouth Course 1.65 mi (2.66 km) 12 turns File:Virginia International Raceway - Patriot Course.svgPatriot Course 1.10 mi (1.77 km) 12 turns Celebrities at VIR Several celebrities have visited VIR.

In early October 2013 actor Patrick Dempsey, a star of Grey's Anatomy, and former athlete and reality-TV star Caitlyn Jenner raced at the track. History Pit road during 2008 Grand-Am race The track originally opened August 3, 1957, and was created by a group of men using a bulldozer. The track had been closed from 1974 prior to its reopening in March 2000. The track was reopened in 2000 by New Yorker Harvey Siegel and Connie Nyholm using a \\"country club\\" model. Memberships to the track are sold. Each member of the VIR Club receives track time on member days, tickets to all spectator events, and other benefits. VIR's membership model has since been followed by other racetracks across the United States. There have been at least four deaths in track history, with three fatalities coming since the reopening of the facility. The most recent death was that of 14-year-old Toriano Wilson in a US Rookie Cup motorcycle race in August 2008. The track hosted the SCCA National Sports Car Championship from its opening in 1957 until the series' demise in 1964. The IMSA GT Championship visited VIR in 1971 and 1972. After its re-opening, the AMA Superbike Championship held races at VIR from 2001 until 2010 on the North Course. The Rolex Sports Car Series utilized the Full Course from 2002 through 2011. The American Le Mans Series used the Full Course configuration for its inaugural event at VIR in September 2012 where a new track record was set by Klaus Graf driving the Muscle Milk LMP1 car. Driving a Maserati 450S, Carroll Shelby won the feature race on the track‚Äôs inaugural weekend in August 1957.

Various driving training classes are available on the paved and unpaved (off-road) courses. The site also hosts a go kart track. Since 2014, VIR has hosted a GT only race in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Testing The track is frequently used for test sessions by NASCAR teams. The teams use the road course to test their road course cars for the Watkins Glen International and Sonoma Raceway races. Since the track is not currently active on the principal NASCAR circuit (Trucks, Xfinity and Cup), a practice session is not charged against their allotment. The track is also used by various manufacturers in testing of new or updated vehicles.

SIMNET was developed for and used by the United States military. SIMNET development began in the mid-1980s, was fielded starting in 1987, and was used for training until successor programs came online well into the 1990s.  Origination and Purpose  Jack Thorpe of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) saw the need for networked multi-user simulation. Interactive simulation equipment was very expensive, and reproducing training facilities was likewise expensive and time consuming. In the early 1980s, DARPA decided to create a prototype research system to investigate the feasibility of creating a real-time distributed simulator for combat simulation. SIMNET, the resulting application, was to prove both the feasibility and effectiveness of such a project (Pimental and Blau 1994). Training using actual equipment was extremely expensive and dangerous. Being able to simulate certain combat scenarios, and to have participants remotely located rather than all in one place, hugely reduced the cost of training and the risk of personal injury (Rheingold 1992). Long-haul networking for SIMNET was run originally across multiple 56 kbit/s dial-up lines, using parallel processors to compress packets over the data links. This traffic contained not only the vehicle data but also compressed voice.  Companies who Developed SIMNET  SIMNET was developed by three companies: Delta Graphics, Inc.; Perceptronics, Inc.; and Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), Inc. There was no prime contractor on SIMNET; independent contracts were made directly with each of these three companies. BBN developed the vehicle simulation and network software, as well as other software such as artillery, resupply, and semi- automated forces often used for opposing forces. Delta Graphics, based in Bellevue, Washington, developed the graphics system and terrain databases. Delta Graphics was eventually bought by BBN. Perceptronics, based in Los Angeles, was responsible for the actual SIMNET simulators; the company's engineers, human factors personnel and manufacturing team designed, developed and built over 300 full-crew simulators, integrating the controls, sound systems and visual systems into the special simulator shells; they also installed the simulators in a number of facilities in the US and Germany, trained the operators and supported the system for several years. BBN was responsible for developing the dynamic simulation software for each of the simulators, as well as the distributed networking communication software that kept each simulator informed of the position (and other state information) of other simulators that were within potential line-of-sight within the shared virtual environment. Each simulator maintained its own copy of this virtual environment, and broadcast its own state information to the other simulators.  Network Advances  Since this was a networked simulation, each simulation station needed its own display of the shared virtual environment. The display stations themselves were mock-ups of certain tank and aircraft control simulators, and they were configured to simulate conditions within the actual combat vehicle. The tank simulators, for example, could accommodate a full four-person crew complement to enhance the effectiveness of the training. The network was designed to support up to several hundred users at once. The fidelity of the simulation was such that it could be used to train for mission scenarios and tactical rehearsals for operations performed during the U.S. actions in Desert Storm in 1992 (Robinett 1994). SIMNET used the concept of ‚Äúdead reckoning‚Äù to correlate the positions of the objects and actors within the simulated environment. Duncan (Duke) Miller, the BBN SIMNET program manager, first used this term, which harks back to the earliest days of ship navigation, to explain how simulators were able to communicate state change information to each other while minimizing network traffic. Essentially, the approach involves calculating the current position of an object from its previous position and velocity (which is composed of vector and speed elements) (Pimental and Blau 1994). The SIMNET protocols provided that whenever the true state of a simulator deviated by more than a certain threshold from its state as computed by dead reckoning, the simulator was obligated to send out a new state update message. The use of SIMNET protocols and SIMNET-based training systems in the First Gulf War demonstrates the success of the SIMNET, and its legacy was viewed as proof that realtime interactive networked cooperative virtual simulation is possible for a large user population. Later, the Terrestrial Wideband Network (a high speed descendant of the ARPANET that ran at T1 speeds) was used to carry traffic. This network remained under DARPA after the rest of ARPANET was merged with NSFNet and the ARPANET was decommissioned (Rheingold 1992).  Graphics Advances  In addition to the network, the second fundamental challenge at the time SIMNET was conceived was the inability of graphics systems to handle large numbers of moving models. For example, most contemporary flight simulators used Binary Space Partitioning which is computationally effective for fixed environments since polygon display order (i.e., their depth coherence) can be pre-computed. While suitable for flight simulators, which largely have a point of view above the Earth's fixed surface, this technique is ineffective near the ground, where the order in which polygons overlay each other changes with the location of the point of view. It is also ineffective with a large number of moving models, since moving a model changes its depth coherence relative to the polygons representing the ground. In contrast, Z-buffer techniques do not depend on pre-computed depth coherence and were therefore a key enabling technology for SIMNET's on-ground point of view and large numbers of moving vehicles. Z-buffering is memory intensive relative to Binary Space Partitioning but was made possible in part because the cost of RAM at the time had dropped significantly in price. SIMNET used Z-buffer displays developed by Delta Graphics. Delta Graphics was founded by Drew Johnston (SW development), Mike Cyrus (President), both from the Boeing Aerospace Company/Graphics Lab, and Jay Beck (CTO and VP), a 3D graphics consultant of Softtool Consulting. The graphics processor, the GDP, custom developed for SIMNET by Gary Wilson (Sr HW Engineer), won out over existing Silicon Graphics HW because of its low cost and because its architecture. It was the first simulator display processor to use a frame buffer and Z-buffer algorithms on a per display channel basis to show the simulated view.  Army Use of SIMNET for Training  SIMNET was actively used by the U.S. Army for training primarily at Fort Benning, Fort Rucker, and Fort Knox. Additional temporary and permanent locations were in Fort Leavenworth and Grafenwoehr, Germany.  SIMNET Follow-On Programs  The follow-on protocols to SIMNET were called Distributed Interactive Simulation; the primary U.S. Army follow- on program was the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT). The SIMNET-D (Developmental) program used simulation systems developed in the SIMNET program to perform experiments in weapon systems, concepts, and tactics. It became the Advanced Simulation Technology Demonstration (ADST) program. It fostered the creation of the Battle Labs across the US Army, including the Mounted Warfare TestBed at Ft Knox, Ky, the Soldier Battle Lab at Ft Benning, GA, the Air Maneuver Battle Lab at Ft Rucker, AL, the Fires Battle Lab at Ft Sill, OK. Additional research programs after the end of SIMNET included work in weather and real-time terrain modifications.  Companies and Technologies Founded Based on SIMNET Experience  One of the primary developers of the network for SIMNET, Rolland Waters, founded RTIME, Inc. in 1992, to provide to the game industry network engines. Sony (SCEA) bought RTIME in 2000 as the basis for their PS2 online game network. Other startups out of the BBN / Delta Graphics team include: * MetaVR, Inc (W. Garth Smith), simulation and training, GIS systems * MaK Technologies (John Morrison and Warren Katz), which continues to provide simulation software * Reality by Design, Inc (Joanne West Metzger and Paul Metzger), simulation and training software and systems * Zipper Interactive (Brian Soderberg), which developed the SOCOM PS2 game series and was also purchased by SCEA * Wiz!Bang (Drew Johnston), another game developer.

San Francisco is the name of both the city and the county; the two share the same boundaries. Only lightly settled by European- Americans at first, after becoming the base for the gold rush of 1849, the city quickly became the largest and most important population, commercial, naval, and financial center in the American West. San Francisco was devastated by a great earthquake and fire in 1906 but was quickly rebuilt. The San Francisco Federal Reserve Branch opened in 1914, and the city continued to develop as a major business city throughout the first half of the 20th century. Starting in the later half of the 1960s, San Francisco became the city most famous for the hippie movement. In recent decades, San Francisco has become an important center of finance and technology. The high demand for housing, driven by its proximity to Silicon Valley, and the limited availability has led to the city being one of America's most expensive places to live. San Francisco is currently ranked 16th on the Global Financial Centres Index.  Early history  The earliest evidence of human habitation in what is now the city of San Francisco dates to 3000 BC. Native Americans who settled in this region found the bay to be a resource for hunting and gathering, leading to the establishment of many small villages. Collectively, these early Native Americans are now known as the Ohlone, and the language they spoke belonged to the Miwok family. Their trade patterns included places as far away as Baja California, the Mojave Desert and Yosemite.The Ohlone Way, Malcolm Margolin, Heyday Books, 1978. The earliest Europeans to reach the site of San Francisco were a Spanish exploratory party in 1769, led overland from Mexico by Don Gaspar de Portol√° and Fra. Joan Cresp√≠. The Spanish recognized the location, with its large natural harbor, to be of great strategic significance. A subsequent expedition, led by Juan Bautista de Anza, selected sites for military and religious settlements in 1774. The Presidio of San Francisco was established for the military, while Mission San Francisco de As√≠s began the cultural and religious conversion of some 10,000 Ohlone who lived in the area.Sifting the Evidence: Perceptions of life at the Ohlone (Costanoan) Missions of Alta California, by Russell Skowronek, American Society for Ethnohistory, 1998. The mission became known as Mission Dolores, because of its nearness to a creek named after Our Lady of Sorrows. The first anchorage was established at a small inlet on the north-east end of the peninsula (later filled: now lower Market Street), and the small settlement that grew up nearby was named Yerba Buena, after the herb of the same name that grew in abundance there. The original plaza of the Spanish settlement remains as Portsmouth Square. Today's city took its name from the mission, and Yerba Buena became the name of a San Francisco neighborhood now known as South of Market. The Moscone Center and Yerba Buena Gardens are in the Yerba Buena area. In addition, the name Yerba Buena was applied to the former Goat Island in the middle of San Francisco Bay, adjacent to Treasure Island. San Francisco became part of the United States with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848.  Precolonial history  European visitors to the San Francisco Bay Area were preceded at least 8,000 years earlier by Native Americans. According to one anthropologist, the indigenous name for San Francisco was Ahwaste, meaning, \\"place at the bay\\". Linguistic and paleontological evidence is unclear as to whether the earliest inhabitants of the area now known as San Francisco were the ancestors of the Ohlone population encountered by the Spanish in the late 18th century.Ohlone Past and Present by Lowell Bean (ed.) et al., Ballena Press Anthropological Papers No. 42, 1994 The cultural unit, Ohlone, to which the San Francisco natives belonged did not recognize the city or county boundaries imposed later by Americans, and were part of a contiguous set of bands that lived from south of the Golden Gate to San Jos√©. When the Spanish arrived, they found the area inhabited by the Yelamu tribe, which belongs to a linguistic grouping later called the Ohlone. The Ohlone speakers are distinct from Pomo speakers north of the San Francisco Bay, and are part of the Miwok group of languages. Their traditional territory stretched from Big Sur to the San Francisco Bay, although their trading area was much larger. Miwok-speaking Indians also lived in Yosemite, and Ohlone-speakers intermarried with Chumash and Pomo speakers as well. The Spanish conquest of the San Francisco Bay area came later than to Southern California. San Francisco's characteristic foggy weather and geography led early European explorers such as Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo to bypass the Golden Gate and miss entering San Francisco Bay, although it seems clear from historical accounts of navigation that they passed close to the coastline north and south of the Golden Gate.\\"Seekers of the Northern Mystery,\\" by Iris Engstrand, California Historical Quarterly, p78ff, 1997.  Arrival of Europeans and early settlement  View of Presidio of San Francisco circa 1817 by Louis Choris A Spanish exploration party, led by Portol√† and arriving on November 2, 1769, was the first documented European sighting of San Francisco Bay. Portol√† claimed the area for Spain as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Seven years later a Spanish mission, Mission San Francisco de As√≠s (Mission Dolores), was established by Fra. Jun√≠pero Serra, and a military fort was built, the Presidio of San Francisco.For the Revillagigedo Census of 1790, see The Census of 1790, California, California Spanish Genealogy.

In 1786 French explorer, the Comte de La P√©rouse visited San Francisco and left a detailed account of it.De La Perouse, Life in a California Mission. Six years later, in 1792 British explorer George Vancouver also stopped in San Francisco, in part, according to his journal, to spy on the Spanish settlements in the area.Vancouver's Report Presidio of San Francisco, National Park Service. In addition to Western Europeans, Russian fur-traders also visited the area. From 1770 until about 1841, Russian traders colonized an area that ranged from Alaska south to Fort Ross in Sonoma County, California. The naming of San Francisco's Russian Hill neighborhood is attributed to the remains of Russian fur traders and sailors found there. Upon independence from Spain in 1821, the area became part of Mexico. In 1835, Englishman William Richardson erected the first significant homestead outside the immediate vicinity of the Mission Dolores, near a boat anchorage around what is today Portsmouth Square. Together with Alcalde Francisco de Haro, he laid out a street plan for the expanded settlement, and the town, named Yerba Buena after the herb, which was named by the missionaries that found it abundant nearby, began to attract American settlers. In 1838, Richardson petitioned and received a large land grant in Marin County and, in 1841, he moved there to take up residence at Rancho Sauselito. Richardson Bay to the north bears his name. The British Empire briefly entertained the idea of purchasing the bay from Mexico in 1841, claiming it would \\"Secure to Great Britain all the advantages of the finest port in the Pacific for her commercial speculations in time of peace, and in war for more easily securing her maritime ascendency\\". However little came of this, and San Francisco would become a prize of the United States rather than that of British naval power. On July 31, 1846, Yerba Buena doubled in population when about 240 Mormon pioneers from the East coast arrived on the ship Brooklyn, led by Sam Brannan. Brannan, also a member of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, would later become well known for being the first publicist of the California Gold Rush of 1849 and the first millionaire resulting from it. Portsmouth Square, 1851. US Navy Commodore John D. Sloat claimed California for the United States on July 7, 1846, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and US Navy Captain John Berrien Montgomery and US Marine Second Lieutenant Henry Bulls Watson of the arrived to claim Yerba Buena two days later by raising the flag over the town plaza, which is now Portsmouth Square in honor of the ship. Henry Bulls Watson was placed in command of the garrison there. In August 1846, Lt. Washington A. Bartlett was named alcalde of Yerba Buena. On January 30, 1847, Lt. Bartlett's proclamation changing the name Yerba Buena to San Francisco took effect.History of Yerba Buena Gardens. Yerba Buena Gardens. Accessed August 28, 2003 The city and the rest of California officially became American in 1848 by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. California was admitted to the U.S. as a state on September 9, 1850‚Äîthe State of California soon chartered San Francisco and San Francisco County. At the time the county and city were not coterminous; the county contained modern-day northern San Mateo County. Situated at the tip of a windswept peninsula without water or firewood, San Francisco lacked most of the basic facilities for a 19th-century settlement. These natural disadvantages forced the town's residents to bring water, fuel and food to the site. The first of many environmental transformations was the city's reliance on filled marshlands for real estate. Much of the present downtown is built over the former Yerba Buena Cove, granted to the city by military governor Stephen Watts Kearny in 1847.  1848 gold rush  San Francisco harbor in 1850 or 1851. During this time, the harbor would become so crowded that ships often had to wait days before unloading their passengers and goods. lynched by the Committee of Vigilance, 1856. The California gold rush starting in 1848 led to a large boom in population, including considerable immigration. Between January 1848 and December 1849, the population of San Francisco increased from 1,000 to 25,000. The rapid growth continued through the 1850s and under the influence of the 1859 Comstock Lode silver discovery. This rapid growth complicated city planning efforts, leaving a legacy of narrow streets that continues to characterize the city to this day. The population boom included many workers from China who came to work in the gold mines and later on the Transcontinental Railroad. The Chinatown district of the city became and is still one of the largest in the country; today, as a result of that legacy, the city as a whole is roughly one-fifth Chinese, one of the largest concentrations outside of China. Many businesses founded to service the growing population exist today, notably Levi Strauss & Co. clothing, Ghirardelli chocolate, and Wells Fargo bank. Many famous railroad, banking, and mining tycoons or \\"robber barons\\" such as Charles Crocker, Mark Hopkins, Collis P. Huntington, and Leland Stanford settled in the city in its Nob Hill neighborhood. The sites of their mansions are now famous and expensive San Francisco hotels (Mark Hopkins Hotel and the Huntington Hotel). As in many mining towns, the social climate in early San Francisco was chaotic. Committees of Vigilance were formed in 1851, and again in 1856, in response to crime and government corruption. This popular militia movement lynched 12 people, kidnapped hundreds of Irishmen and government militia members, and forced several elected officials to resign. The Committee of Vigilance relinquished power both times after it decided the city had been \\"cleaned up.\\" This mob activity later focused on Chinese immigrants, creating many race riots.Bodenner, Chris. \\"Chinese Exclusion Act.\\" Issues & Controversies in American History @ FACTS.com. 20 Oct. 2006. Facts On File News Services. 24 Dec. 2010 These riots culminated in the creation of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 that aimed to reduce Chinese immigration to the United States by limiting immigration to males and reducing numbers of immigrants allowed in the city.Kennedy, David M. Cohen, Lizabeth, Bailey, Thomas A. The American Pageant. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2002 The law was not repealed until 1943 with the Magnuson Act. San Francisco was the county seat of San Francisco County, one of state's 18 original counties since California's statehood in 1850. Until 1856, the city limits extended west to Divisadero Street and Castro Street, and south to 20th Street. In response to the lawlessness and vigilantism that escalated rapidly between 1855 and 1856, the California government decided to divide the county. A straight line was then drawn across the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula just north of San Bruno Mountain. Everything south of the line became San Mateo County while everything north of the line became the new consolidated City and County of San Francisco, to date the only consolidated city-county in California. In autumn of 1855, a ship bearing refugees from an ongoing cholera epidemic in the Far East (authorities disagree as to whether this was the S.S. Sam or the S.S. Carolina but primary documents indicate that the Carolina was involved in the epidemic of 1850 and the SS Uncle Sam in the epidemic of 1855) docked in San Francisco. Since the city's rapid Gold Rush population growth had significantly outstripped the development of infrastructure, including sanitation, a serious cholera epidemic quickly broke out. The responsibility for caring for the indigent sick had previously rested on the state, but faced with the San Francisco cholera epidemic, the state legislature devolved this responsibility to the counties, setting the precedent for California's system of county hospitals for the poor still in effect today. The Sisters of Mercy were contracted to run San Francisco's first county hospital, the State Marine and County Hospital, due to their efficiency in handling the cholera epidemic of 1855. By 1857, the order opened St. Mary's Hospital on Stockton Street, the first Catholic hospital west of the Rocky Mountains. In 1905, The Sisters of Mercy purchased a lot at Fulton and Stanyan Streets, the current location of St. Mary's Medical Center, the oldest continually operating hospital in San Francisco. Due to the Gold Rush, and despite the Vigilantes, and the gradual implementation of law and order in San Francisco, its red-light district at the time became known as the Barbary Coast which became a hotbed of gambling, prostitution and most notoriously for Shanghaiing. It is now overlapped by Chinatown, North Beach, Jackson Square, and the Financial District.  Paris of the West  Ross Alley in San Francisco's Chinatown 1898. (Photo by Arnold Genthe) It was during the 1860s to the 1880s when San Francisco began to transform into a major city, starting with massive expansion in all directions, creating new neighborhoods such as the Western Addition, the Haight-Ashbury, Eureka Valley, the Mission District, culminating in the construction of Golden Gate Park in 1887. In 1864 Hugh H. Toland, a South Carolina surgeon who found great success and wealth after moving to San Francisco, founded the Toland Medical College, which became one of three affiliated colleges, which later developed into the University of California, San Francisco. Initially, the affiliated colleges were located at different sites around San Francisco, but near the end of the 19th century interest in bringing them together grew. To make this possible, San Francisco Mayor Adolph Sutro donated 13 acres in Parnassus Heights at the base of Mount Parnassus (now known as Mount Sutro). The new site, overlooking Golden Gate Park, opened in the fall of 1898, with the construction of the new affiliated colleges buildings. The city's famous cable cars were built around this time, a unique invention devised by Andrew Smith Hallidie in order to traverse the city's steep hills while connecting the new residential developments. San Francisco grew in cultural prominence at this time as famous writers Mark Twain, Bret Harte, Ambrose Bierce, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Oscar Wilde spent time in the city, while local characters developed such as Emperor Norton. The San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange was founded in 1882. By the 1890s, much like across the United States, San Francisco was suffering from machine politics and corruption, and was ripe for political reform. Adolph Sutro ran for mayor in 1894 under the auspices of the Populist Party and won handily without campaigning. Unfortunately, except for the Sutro Baths, Mayor Sutro substantially failed in his efforts to improve the city. The next mayor, James D. Phelan elected in 1896, was more successful, pushing through a new city charter that allowed for the ability to raise funds through bond issues. He got bonds passed to construct a new sewer system, 17 new schools, two parks, a hospital, and a main library. After leaving office in 1901, Phelan became interested in remaking San Francisco into a grand and modern Paris of the West. In 1900, a ship brought with it rats infected with bubonic plague to initiate the San Francisco plague of 1900‚Äì1904; the first plague epidemic in the continental U.S. Mistakenly believing that interred corpses contributed to the transmission of plague, and possibly motivated by the opportunity for profitable land speculation, city leaders banned all burials within the city. Cemeteries moved to the undeveloped area just south of the city limit, now the town of Colma, California. A 15-block section of Chinatown was quarantined while city leaders squabbled over the proper course to take, but the outbreak finally was eradicated by 1905. However, the problem of existing cemeteries and the shortage of land in the city remained. In 1912 (with fights extending until 1942), all remaining cemeteries in the city were evicted to Colma, where the dead now outnumber the living by more than 1,000 to one. The above-ground Columbarium of San Francisco was allowed to remain, as well as the historic cemetery at Mission Dolores, the grave of Thomas Starr King at the Unitarian Church, and the San Francisco National Cemetery at the Presidio of San Francisco.  Corruption and graft trials  Political boss Abe Ruef of San Francisco on his way to San Quentin State Prison after he was convicted in the San Francisco Graft Trial of 1907‚Äì1908. Mayor Eugene Schmitz, president of the Musician's Union, was chosen by political leader Abe Ruef to run for mayor as a front for the Union Labor Party in 1901. He and Ruef had been friends for 18 years. Ruef contributed $16,000 (about $ today) to Schmitz' campaign and used his considerable influence to make sure Schmitz was selected to front for the new Union Labor Party. Ruef wrote the Union Labor Party's platform and built a strong, behind-the-scenes network of supporters, including the more than 5,000 saloon keepers and another 2,000 bartenders in San Francisco, who all influenced political discussions in their saloons. Schmitz was less corrupt than the mayors who preceded him, but he had to deal with Ruef who operated from his offices at California and Kearney Streets. He wrote most of the mayor's official papers and conducted an ongoing series of meetings with Mayor Schmitz, city commissioners, officials, seekers of favors or jobs, and others. Officially an unpaid attorney for the mayor's office, he was the power behind the mayor's chair. Former Mayor Phelan, in concert with Rudolph Spreckels, president of the San Francisco First National Bank, and Fremont Older, editor of the San Francisco Bulletin, decided to try to challenge the Labor Party's corrupt choke-hold on city politics and commerce. They got Francis Heney, a U.S. special prosecutor, to help with the investigation and prosecution. Heney eventually charged Ruef and Schmitz with numerous counts of bribery and brought them to trial. On June 13, 1907, Mayor E. E. Schmitz was found guilty of extortion and the office of Mayor was declared vacant. He was sent to jail to await sentence. Shortly thereafter he was sentenced to five years at San Quentin State Prison, the maximum sentence the law allowed. He immediately appealed. While awaiting the outcome of the appeal, Schmitz was kept in a cell in San Francisco County Jail. Dr. Edward R. Taylor, Dean of Hastings College, agreed to step in as interim mayor and was given power to appoint new supervisors to replace those who had resigned. Ruef was found guilty and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. In November 1910, his conviction and sentence were finally upheld, and on March 1, 1911, he entered prison. On August 23, 1915, having served a little more than four and a half of his fourteen-year sentence, he was released. He was the only person in the entire investigation who went to prison. He was not allowed to return to his legal practice. \\"Before he went to prison he had been worth over a million dollars, when he died he was bankrupt.\\"  1906 earthquake and fire  On April 18, 1906, a devastating earthquake resulted from the rupture of over 270 miles of the San Andreas Fault, from San Juan Bautista to Eureka, centered immediately offshore of San Francisco. The quake is estimated by the USGS to have had a magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter scale. Water mains ruptured throughout San Francisco, and the fires that followed burned out of control for days, destroying approximately 80% of the city, including almost all of the downtown core. Many residents were trapped between the water on three sides and the approaching fire, and a mass evacuation across the Bay saved thousands. Refugee camps were also set up in Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, and other undeveloped sections of the city. The official death toll at the time was 478, although it was officially revised in 2005 to 3,000+. The initial low death toll was concocted by civic, state, and federal officials who felt that reporting the actual numbers would hurt rebuilding and redevelopment efforts, as well as city and national morale. The death toll from this event had the highest number of deaths from a natural disaster in California history. = Reconstruction = By the time of this postcard circa 1920s, San Francisco had been fully rebuilt. Almost immediately after the quake re-planning and reconstruction plans were hatched to quickly rebuild the city. One of the more famous and ambitious plans, proposed before the fire, came from famed urban planner, Daniel Burnham. His bold plan called for Haussmann style avenues, boulevards, and arterial thoroughfares that radiated across the city, a massive civic center complex with classical structures, what would have been the largest urban park in the world, stretching from Twin Peaks to Lake Merced with a large athenaeum at its peak, and various other proposals. This plan was dismissed by critics (both at the time and now), as impractical and unrealistic to municipal supply and demand. Property owners and the Real Estate industry were against the idea as well due to the amounts of their land the city would have to purchase to realize such proposals. While the original street grid was restored, many of Burnham's proposals eventually saw the light of day such as a neo-classical civic center complex, wider streets, a preference of arterial thoroughfares, a subway under Market Street, a more people-friendly Fisherman's Wharf, and a monument to the city on Telegraph Hill, Coit Tower. With many rats and people displaced, a minor outbreak of plague occurred in San Francisco and Oakland during reconstruction, but unlike the 1901-1904 outbreak, government authorities responded quickly. Map of San Francisco Area in 1915 = \\"Greater San Francisco\\" movement of 1912 = In 1912, there was a movement to create a Greater San Francisco in which southern Marin County, the part of Alameda County which includes Oakland, Piedmont and Berkeley, and northern San Mateo County from San Bruno northwards would have become outer Boroughs of San Francisco, with the City and County of San Francisco functioning as Manhattan, based on the New York City model. East Bay opposition defeated the San Francisco expansion plan in the California legislature, and later attempts at San Francisco Bay Area metropolitan area consolidation in 1917, 1923, and 1928 also failed to be implemented.The San Francisco Bay Area‚Äîa Metropolis in Perspective by Mel Scott Berkeley:1985 University of California Press‚ÄîSee chapter 9‚Äî\\"The Greater San Francisco Movement\\" Pages 133‚Äì148 Google Books Result: The San Francisco Bay Area‚Äîa Metropolis in Perspective by Mel Scott Berkeley:1985 University of California Press‚ÄîGreater San Francisco Movement:  Panama‚ÄìPacific Exposition of 1915  Overview of Panama‚ÄìPacific Exposition, 1915. Tower of Jewels in center. Alcatraz Island & San Francisco Bay in background, just inside the Golden Gate. In 1915, the city hosted the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition, officially to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal, but also as a showcase of the vibrant completely rebuilt city less than a decade after the earthquake. After the exposition ended, all of its grand buildings were demolished except for the rebuilt Palace of Fine Arts which survives today in an abbreviated form, while the remainder of the fairgrounds were re-developed into the Marina District.  1930s ‚Äì World War II  USS San Francisco steams under the Golden Gate Bridge in 1942, during World War II. Japantown residents form a line outside to appear for \\"processing\\" as required by Civilian Exclusion Order Number 20. 1934 saw San Francisco become the center of the West Coast waterfront strike. The strike lasted eighty-three days and saw the deaths of two workers, but the result led to the unionization of all of the West Coast ports of the United States. The San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge was opened in 1936 and the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937. The 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition was held on Treasure Island. It was in this period that the island of Alcatraz, a former military stockade, began its service as a federal maximum security prison, housing notorious inmates such as Al Capone, and Robert Franklin Stroud, The Birdman of Alcatraz. During World War II, San Francisco was the major mainland supply point and port of embarkation for the war in the Pacific. It also saw the largest and oldest enclave of Japanese outside of Japan, Japantown, completely remove all of its ethnic Japanese residents as a result of Executive Order 9066 that forced all Japanese of birth or descent in the United States to be interned. By 1943 many large sections of the neighborhood remained vacant due to the forced internment. The void was quickly filled by thousands of African Americans who had left the South to find wartime industrial jobs in California as part of the Great Migration. Many African Americans also settled in the Fillmore District and most notably near the Bayview-Hunters Point shipyards, working in the dry-docks there. The same docks at Hunters Point would be used for loading the key fissile components of the first atomic bomb onto the USS Indianapolis in July 1945 for transfer to Tinian. The War Memorial Opera House which opened in 1932, was the site of some significant post World War II history. In 1945, the conference that formed the United Nations was held there, with the UN Charter being signed nearby in the Herbst Theatre on June 26. Additionally the Treaty of San Francisco which formally ended war with Japan and established peaceful relations, was drafted and signed here six years later in 1951.  Post-World War II  San Francisco circa 1950. After World War II, many American military personnel, who fell in love with the city while leaving for or returning from the Pacific, settled in the city, prompting the creation of the Sunset District, Visitacion Valley, and the total build out of San Francisco. During this period, Caltrans commenced an aggressive freeway construction program in the Bay Area. However, Caltrans soon encountered strong resistance in San Francisco, for the city's high population density meant that virtually any right-of-way would displace a large number of people. Caltrans tried to minimize displacement (and its land acquisition costs) by building double-decker freeways, but the crude state of civil engineering at that time resulted in construction of some embarrassingly ugly freeways which ultimately turned out to be seismically unsafe. In 1959, the Board of Supervisors voted to halt construction of any more freeways in the city, an event known as the Freeway Revolt. Although some minor modifications have been allowed to the ends of existing freeways, the city's anti-freeway policy has remained in place ever since. The San Francisco Mental Hygiene Society was formed in 1947. In 1958 the New York Giants moved to San Francisco and became the San Francisco Giants. Their first stadium, Candlestick Park, was constructed in 1959. = Urban renewal = In the 1950s San Francisco mayor George Christopher hired M. Justin Herman to head the redevelopment agency for the city and county. Justin Herman began an aggressive campaign to tear down blighted areas of the city that were really working class, non-white neighborhoods. Enacting eminent domain whenever necessary, he set upon a plan to tear down huge areas of the city and replace them with modern construction. Critics accused Herman of racism for what was perceived as attempts to create segregation and displacement of blacks. Many black residents were forced to move from their homes near the Fillmore jazz district to newly constructed projects such as near the naval base at Hunter's Point or even to other cities such as Oakland. He began leveling entire areas in San Francisco's Western Addition and Japantown neighborhoods. Herman also completed the final removal of the produce district below Telegraph Hill, moving the produce merchants to the Alemany Boulevard site. His planning led to the creation of Embarcadero Center, the Embarcadero Freeway, Japantown, the Geary Street superblocks, and eventually Yerba Buena Gardens.  1960 ‚Äì 1970s  = \\"Summer of Love\\" and counterculture movement = Following World War II, San Francisco became a magnet for America's counterculture. During the 1950s, City Lights Bookstore in the North Beach neighborhood was an important publisher of Beat Generation literature. Some of the story of the evolving arts scene of the 1950s is told in the article San Francisco Renaissance. During the latter half of the following decade, the 1960s, San Francisco was the center of hippie and other alternative culture. In 1967, thousands of young people entered the Haight- Ashbury district during what became known as the Summer of Love. The San Francisco Sound emerged as an influential force in rock music, with such acts as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead achieving international prominence. These groups blurred the boundaries between folk, rock and jazz traditions and further developed rock's lyrical content. = Rise of the \\"Gay Mecca\\" = Rioters outside San Francisco City Hall the evening of May 21, 1979, reacting to the voluntary manslaughter verdict for Dan White, that ensured White would serve only five years for the double murders of Harvey Milk and George Moscone. San Francisco's frontier spirit and wild and ribald character started its reputation as a gay mecca in the first half of the 20th century. World War II saw a jump in the gay population when the US military actively sought out and dishonorably discharged homosexuals. From 1941 to 1945, more than 9,000 gay servicemen and women were discharged, and many were processed out in San Francisco. The late 1960s also brought in a new wave of lesbians and gays who were more radical and less mainstream and who had flocked to San Francisco not only for its gay-friendly reputation, but for its reputation as a radical, left-wing center. These new residents were the prime movers of Gay Liberation and often lived communally, buying decrepit Victorians in the Haight and fixing them up. When drugs and violence began to become a serious problem in the Haight, many lesbians and gays simply moved \\"over the hill\\" to the Castro replacing Irish-Americans who had moved to the more affluent and culturally homogeneous suburbs. The Castro became known as a Gay Mecca, and its gay population swelled as significant numbers of gay people moved to San Francisco in the 1970s and 1980s. The growth of the gay population caused tensions with some of the established ethnic groups in the southern part of the city. On November 27, 1978 Dan White, a former member of the Board of Supervisors and former police officer, assassinated the city's mayor George Moscone and San Francisco's first openly gay elected official, Supervisor Harvey Milk. The murders and the subsequent trial were marked both by candlelight vigils and homosexual riots. In the 1980s, HIV (formerly called LAV, HTLV-III, also known as AIDS virus) created havoc in the gay community. The gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender population of the city is still the highest of any major metropolitan area in the United States. =New public infrastructure= The 1970s also brought other major changes to the city such as the construction of its first subway system, BART, which connects San Francisco with other cities in the Bay Area; it was installed in 1972. At stations in downtown San Francisco, BART connects with Muni, the city subway, which has lines that run underground along Market Street, and then along surface streets through much of the city. San Francisco's second tallest building, the Transamerica Pyramid was also completed during that year.  1980s  Dianne Feinstein was mayor of San Francisco throughout the 1980s. A building in the Marina District at Beach and Divisadero settled onto its buckled garage supports during the Loma Prieta Quake. During the administration of Mayor Dianne Feinstein (1978‚Äì1988), San Francisco saw a development boom referred to as \\"Manhattanization.\\" Many large skyscrapers were built‚Äîprimarily in the Financial District‚Äîbut the boom also included high-rise condominiums in some residential neighborhoods. An opposition movement gained traction among those who felt the skyscrapers ruined views and destroyed San Francisco's unique character. Similar to the freeway revolt in the city decades earlier, a \\"skyscraper revolt\\" forced the city to embed height restrictions in the planning code. For many years, the limits slowed construction of new skyscrapers. She had also spearheaded the development and construction of the city's convention center, the Moscone Center, preserved and renovated the city's Cable Cars, and attracted the 1984 Democratic National Convention. During the early 1980s, homeless people began appearing in large numbers in the city, the result of multiple factors including the closing of state institutions for the mentally ill, the Reagan administration drastically cutting Section 8 housing benefits, and social changes which increased the availability of addictive drugs. Combined with San Francisco's attractive environment and generous welfare policies the problem soon became endemic. Mayor Art Agnos (1988‚Äì92) was the first to attack the problem, and not the last; it is a top issue for San Franciscans even today. His program, Beyond Shelter, became the basis for federal programs and was recognized by Harvard for Innovations in Local Government. Agnos allowed the homeless to camp in the Civic Center park after the Loma Prieta earthquake that made over 1,000 SRO's uninhabitable, which led to its title of \\"Camp Agnos.\\" His opponent used this to attack Agnos in 1991, an election Agnos lost. Frank Jordan launched the \\"MATRIX\\" program the next year, which aimed to displace the homeless through aggressive police action. And it did displace them-to the rest of the city. His successor, Willie Lewis Brown, Jr., was able to largely ignore the problem, riding on the strong economy into a second term. Later, mayor Gavin Newsom created the controversial \\"Care Not Cash\\" program and policy on the homeless, which calls for ending the city's generous welfare policies towards the homeless and instead placing them in affordable housing and requiring them to attend city funded drug rehabilitation and job training programs. In August 1989, San Francisco was surpassed for the first time in population by San Jose (located in Silicon Valley), the world center of the computer industry. San Jose has continued since then to grow in population since it is surrounded by large tracts of developable land. Thus, San Francisco is now the second largest city in population in the San Francisco Bay Area after San Jose. = 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake = On October 17, 1989, an earthquake measuring 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale struck on the San Andreas Fault near Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz mountains, approximately 70 miles (113 km) south of San Francisco, a few minutes before Game 3 of the 1989 World Series was scheduled to begin at Candlestick Park. The quake severely damaged many of the city's freeways including the Embarcadero Freeway and the Central Freeway. Mayor Agnos made the controversial decision to tear down the Embarcadero Freeway, opening the waterfront but eventually shifting Chinatown voters away from him and costing him re-election in 1991. The quake also caused extensive damage in the Marina District and the South of Market neighborhoods.  1990s  The 1990s saw the demolition of the quake damaged Embarcadero and Central Freeway, restoring the once blighted Hayes Valley as well as the city's waterfront promenade, The Embarcadero. In 1994 as part of the Base Realignment and Closure plan, the former military base of San Francisco Naval Shipyard in Bayview-Hunters Point was closed and returned to the city while the Presidio was turned over to the National Park Service and since converted into a national park. In 1996, the city elected its first African American mayor, former Speaker of the California State Assembly, Willie Brown. Brown called for expansions to the San Francisco budget to provide for new employees and programs. During Brown's tenure, San Francisco's budget increased to US$5.2 billion and the city added 4,000 new employees. His tenure saw the development and construction of the new Mission Bay neighborhood, and a baseball stadium for the Giants, AT&T; Park which was 100% privately financed. In 1997, the Pinecrest Diner, a popular all-night diner-style restaurant in San Francisco, became notorious for a murder over an order of eggs. = Dot-com boom = During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, large numbers of entrepreneurs and computer software professionals moved into the city, followed by marketing and sales professionals, and changed the social landscape as once poorer neighborhoods became gentrified. The rising rents forced many people, families, and businesses to leave. San Francisco has the smallest share of children of any major U.S. city, with the city's 18 and under population at just 13.4 percent.  2000s  In 2001, the markets crashed, the boom ended, and many left San Francisco. South of Market, where many dot-com(.com) companies were located, had been bustling and crowded with few vacancies, but by 2002 was a virtual wasteland of empty offices and for-rent signs. Much of the boom was blamed for the city's \\"fastest shrinking population\\", reducing the city's population by 30,000 in just a few years. While the bust helped put an ease on the city's apartment rents, the city remained expensive. By 2003, the city's economy had recovered from the dot-com crash thanks to a resurgent international tourist industry and the Web 2.0 boom that saw the creation of many new internet and software start-up companies in the city, attracting white-collar workers, recent University graduates, and young adults from all over the world. Residential demand as well as rents rose again, and as a result city officials relaxed building height restrictions and zoning codes to construct residential condominiums in SOMA such as One Rincon Hill, 300 Spear Street, and Millennium Tower, although the late 2000s recession has indefinitely halted many construction projects such as Rincon Hill. Part of this development included the reconstruction of the Transbay Terminal Replacement Project.  2010s  The early 2000s and into the 2010s saw the redevelopment of the Mission Bay neighborhood. Originally an industrial district, it underwent development fueled by the construction of the University of California, San Francisco Mission Bay campus and its UCSF Medical Center, and is currently an up-and- coming neighborhood, undergoing development and construction. It has rapidly evolved into a wealthy neighborhood of luxury condominiums, hospitals, and biotechnology research and development. It is also the site of the Chase Center, the arena of the Golden State Warriors and the new Uber headquarters. 2010 saw the San Francisco Giants win their first World Series title since moving from New York City in 1958. The estimated 1 million people who attended their victory parade is considered one of the largest in city history. 2012 saw the Giants win their second title in San Francisco, and 2014 saw them win their third. Celebrations citywide were marred by rioting which caused millions of dollars in property damage. In 2011, city manager Edwin Lee was elected the first Chinese American mayor in any American major city. Mayor Lee has been a strong proponent of tenant's rights, but also a business-friendly mayor to the city's burgeoning tech community. By 2013, San Francisco, with thanks from the Web 2.0 boom, had fully recovered from the late 2000s recession and is experiencing a real estate and population boom. The computer industry is moving north from Silicon Valley. Availability of vacant rental units is scarce and the prices for vacant units has increased dramatically, and as of 2015 is reported to be the highest in the nation. In April 2016, the city passed a law requiring all new buildings below 10 stories to have rooftop solar panels, making it the first major US city to do so.

The cartoon follows Donald Duck attempting to woo a female Mexican duck named Donna. It was directed by Ben Sharpsteen and features music by Paul J. Smith which was adapted from the Mexican folk songs \\"Cielito Lindo\\" and \\"Jarabe Tapat√≠o.\\" Clarence Nash voiced both Donald and Donna. Although billed at the time as another Mickey Mouse cartoon, explaining the face of Mickey Mouse at the beginning of the original release, the film is actually the first installment of the Donald Duck series, and is the first to feature Donald as the primary starring character.Donald had appeared previously in 14 films as a co-star. The film also introduces a love interest for Donald. Plot Donald Duck rides a donkey through the Mexican desert playing a guitar and wearing a sombrero on his way to the house of his girlfriend, Donna Duck. Donna dances the Mexican Hat Dance and eventually lands on Donald's donkey who throws her off his back. Donald laughs causing Donna to get angry. She knocks Donald into a fountain, breaks his guitar over his head, and storms back inside the house. Back outside, the donkey laughs at Donald's misfortunes. Donald decides to exchange the donkey for a car at a nearby trading post. Donna is immediately won back with Donald's car. She lands in the rumble seat and gives Donald a big kiss. Together they speed off through the desert, but eventually the car has engine problems and stops working. Donald confidently tries to fix the problem but the car throws Donald out and speeds off without him. The rumble seat closes on Donna and she is trapped inside with Donald in pursuit. The car crashes, throwing Donna out of the rumble seat, across a waterhole, and into a mud puddle, and Donald laughs at her. Donna furious once again, grabs the car's horn and hits Donald with it, until he lands in some cacti and Donna shoves the horn in his mouth. Donna then rides off on her unicycle which she has conveniently carried with her in her purse, and declares their relationship over. Donald, alone in the desert with the donkey who has escaped from the trading post, is furious at the car and throws the horn at it in retaliation. This however causes the car's radiator to explode and the hot water lands on Donald's sombrero, shrinking it. The donkey laughs yet again. Donna Duck It is unclear if Donna Duck simply represents an earlier version of Daisy Duck or is a separate character entirely. Donna is officially recognized as Daisy by the Internet Movie DatabaseDaisy Duck at the Internet Movie Database and the Big Cartoon DataBase. However Donna was later retconned in a 1951 Disney comic strip as Daisy's rival. Donna made several other appearances in the British magazine Mickey Mouse Weekly.Daisy's First Incarnation as Donna in Mickey Mouse Weekly on Disneyville. Donna did not appear in any other films.

Bond began her career in softcore exploitation films produced by Harry Novak in the late 1960s before moving on to hardcore films in the early 1970s. She was active in the 1970s Los Angeles pornography scene, appearing in more than 80 films and loops. She was noted for her petite figure and conveyed innocence or naivete in her acting approach. Bond was one of the first actresses in the porn industry to get breast implants, and as a result, she claimed that she was offered more parts in films. By the mid-70s, she had started her own mail- order company, selling still photos of herself and slides from her work. Her parents were aware of her work and accompanied her when she performed at burlesque and strip-tease shows. During these shows, Bond invited her father on stage, where she performed to the song \\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\\". Bond was a member of the AVN Hall of Fame as well as the X-Rated Critics Organization Hall of Fame. She later got married and resided in Las Vegas. She died of liver cirrhosis on 2 June 1996. Film career Bond starred in a number of softcore exploitation and sexploitation films, including The Jekyll and Hyde Portfolio (1971). Bond was one of the earliest porn actresses to get breast implants. In a 1977 interview, she stated that this decision was in response to the \\"North American Breast Fetish\\", and claimed that she was offered more roles in films as a result of the implants.

Print. news/talk program that airs on Fox News Channel that premiered on February 1, 1998, hosted by Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade. It begins at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time with the latest Fox News Live headlines and news of the morning and continues with a variety of segments including current events, interviews, updates of news stories with correspondents, political analysis from the hosts, and entertainment segments.  History  Fox & Friends evolved from Fox X-press, Fox News Channel's original morning news program. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, an additional hour was added to the beginning of the weekday show, but branded as a separate show called Fox & Friends First. It was the first Fox News show to air live for the day, starting at 6:00 a.m. It was discontinued on July 13, 2008, and replaced with an additional hour of Fox & Friends. The Fox & Friends First title was reintroduced on March 5, 2012, also as a separate show airing one hour before the main three-hour program, but using a separate slate of rotating anchors.  Format  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the set of Fox & Friends in April 2019 Fox & Friends has been described as being more akin to the Big Three television networks than its cable competitors (particularly CNN's New Day and MSNBC's Morning Joe), with a mix of news, entertainment and lifestyle- oriented segments, and a generally casual presentation. However, as with the morning shows on competing cable news channels, its news content largely concentrates on politics. Currently, Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade co-host the program. = Recurring segments = * The 'Summer Concert Series' features a live music concert in the Fox News Plaza each Friday from Memorial Day weekend though Labor Day weekend. * 'Normal or Nuts' is a segment in which psychiatrist Dr. Keith Ablow answers viewer questions posed via Facebook or Twitter. * 'So Sue Me' is a segment in which Peter Johnson, Jr. (an appellate and trial lawyer) offers his perspective on current events with legal implications.  Ratings  The New York Times has reported the show is one of the most successful on the network. After the arrival of Elisabeth Hasselbeck in September 2013, the show climbed 23 percent in total viewers compared to its average for the third quarter of 2013, and 22 percent in the key 25‚Äì54 news demo. For Hasselbeck's first four weeks on the show, Fox & Friends averaged 1.226 million total viewers, up from the 1.058 that the show averaged for the third quarter of the year. In February 2017, the program's average ratings increased to around 1.7 million viewers, fueled by the recent inauguration of Republican candidate Donald Trump as president.  Political stance  In 2012, The New York Times wrote that Fox & Friends \\"has become a powerful platform for some of the most strident attacks on President Obama.\\" The program has provided a platform for conspiracy theories about Obama's religion and, in May 2012, aired a 4-minute video attacking Obama's record as President. The video was widely criticized as a political attack ad masquerading as journalism; Time magazine television critic James Poniewozik wrote: \\"It's hard to imagine a more over-the-top parody of Fox News raw-meat- hurling, fear-stoking, base-pleasing agitprop.\\" In response, a Fox News executive vice-president 'disavowed' the video, blaming an associate producer and that the video 'slipped by' senior managers at the network. Fox News stated that the show was entertainment and \\"does not pretend to be straight news.\\" Current U.S. president Donald Trump is a regular viewer of Fox & Friends, and has praised the program on Twitter for its favorable coverage of his presidency. Critics have noted that Trump often \\"live-tweets\\" about stories featured on Fox & Friends as they air‚Äîwhich creates a \\"feedback loop\\" when the stories are acknowledged as national issues because they were discussed by Trump on social media. Trump was a frequent guest on Fox & Friends before his presidency. In 2018, Fox News announced that he would appear on the show to offer commentary every Monday. On April 26, 2018, Trump was interviewed by phone on Fox & Friends in a segment that stretched to nearly half an hour, and discussed several recent topics and controversies surrounding himself and his government. Trump said that he might interfere with the Special Counsel investigation, acknowledged that lawyer Michael Cohen had represented Trump in the Stormy Daniels‚ÄìDonald Trump legal dispute, and said that he had gotten a card and flowers for Melania, his wife, whose birthday was the same day.

The company provides software and services to help corporations update their privacy management processes so they comply with government laws and best practices. History TrustArc, was founded as a non-profit industry association called TRUSTe in 1997 by Lori Fena, then executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Charles Jennings, a software entrepreneur, with the mission of fostering online commerce by helping businesses and other online organizations self-regulate privacy concerns. In 2000, TRUSTe became the first organization to join the Safe Harbor framework of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union, and subsequently launched its EU Safe Harbor Seal Program.http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/fena_071201.htm The EU-US Safe Harbor was agreed upon by the Department of Commerce and the EU to provide a framework for American companies to comply with European data and privacy standards.The EU-U.S. Privacy Collision: A Turn to Institutions and Procedures, 126 Harv. L. Rev. 1966 (2013) In 2001, TRUSTe became a Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Safe Harbor organization for the Federal Trade Commission and thereafter launched its Children's Privacy Seal Program. That year, Fran Maier, who had helped build Match.com and had been running the company following the departure of its co-founder, Gary Kremen, joined the organization as Executive Director. One of her first efforts was to address consumer issues with email spam, which at the time was estimated to comprise 59 percent of all email traffic. The same year, TRUSTe's founding Executive Director, Susan Yamada, who was formerly editor of Upside Magazine, resigned, though later went on to serve as board chair. In 2008, TRUSTe changed its structure from a non-profit industry association to a venture-backed for- profit company, raising its first round of capital from Accel Partners. This raised the question of whether a for-profit company would be less stringent on the companies it certifies than a non-profit. In November 2009, Chris Babel, former Senior Vice President of VeriSign's worldwide Authentication Services, joined TRUSTe as chief executive officer. Maier remained active in the company until 2014, serving variously as president, CEO and board chair. In 2013, TRUSTe was approved by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance as an official certification provider for the EU Self-Regulatory Programme for Online Behavioural Advertising. The same year, TRUSTe was named the first approved Accountability Agent for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's Cross Border Privacy Rules System. In 2016, in an effort to help companies prepare for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which extends the scope of the EU data protection law established in 1995 to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents, TRUSTe partnered with the International Association of Privacy Professionals to offer free compliance assessments of a company's privacy practices. On June 6, 2017, the company changed its name from TRUSTe to TrustArc. Services TrustArc's certification subsidiary, TRUSTe, provides privacy dispute resolution services, designed to help oversee consumer requests and complaints regarding the privacy practices of those companies participating in TRUSTe's program.  Criticism and Controversies  A Wired article in 2002 questioned whether TRUSTe certification could be trusted, noting that \\"TRUSTe officials often seemed to be covering for their clients\\" rather than revoking privacy seals for violations. In January 2006, Harvard economics researcher Benjamin Edelman published a study showing that sites with TRUSTe certification were 50 percent more likely to violate privacy policies than uncertified sites. Edelman also reported that TRUSTe did not go far enough to punish seal holders that break their rules and was not prompt enough in revoking the seal on companies that violate privacy standards. = Federal Trade Commission settlement = On November 17, 2014, the Federal Trade Commission announced that TRUSTe had agreed to settle a complaint that it misrepresented to consumers its recertification program, and its status as a non-profit entity, against a $200,000 penalty. The FTC complaint alleged that from 2006 to 2013, TRUSTe failed, in over 1000 instances, to conduct annual privacy checks on the companies it certified. Consumer organizations, including Center for Digital Democracy and the Consumer Federation of America, argued for higher penalties and more FTC oversight, but the FTC declined to increase the penalties. FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen issued a partial dissent to the FTC ruling, \\"because TRUSTe never misrepresented its corporate status,\\" and had informed clients of its for-profit status. TrustArc deliberately slows the process of opting out of tracking and is presently under investigation for flouting the law in this way.

For the Nethergate area of Dundee, see City Centre, Dundee. Nethergate is a computer-based historical- fiction fantasy role-playing game by Spiderweb Software available for the Macintosh and Microsoft Windows platforms. The game was released in 1998 by Jeff Vogel, and was Spiderweb Software's first game to feature a 45¬∞ isometric viewing angle. Nethergate offers the feature of being able to play on either side of the story, as Celts or Romans. The game has a plot which allows for several endings and many side quests, which flow alongside the main story. Spiderweb Software released a remake called Nethergate Resurrection in May 2007. Plot The Player begins with a party of four characters, who are either \\"A small band of Roman Soldiers sent to the Shadowvale to complete a mysterious mission,\\" or a \\"Band of Celtic warriors told by your chief to go to the village of Nethergate for mysterious reasons\\". Shadowvale is an isolated valley controlled by the Brigantes and the games events take place during the time of Boudica's rebellion in 60/61 A.D. The linear missions of the Romans and the Celts complement each other to a certain extent. Romans are first faced with retrieving a satchel with vital information for Shadow Valley Fort from a nearby mine infested with Goblins, while the Celts' first mission is to acquire a bronze token from a nearby pit in which Goblins have made their fortification. From there, both sides make their way to the house of the Three Crones, who are very similar to the Three Fates of Greek Mythology. The Crones aid the player if they have a Roman party and give tasks to accomplish, but imprison them if the player has a Celtic party. The next location of travel is a ruined faerie hall, in which the party acquires a contract between the Sidhe and the village of Nethergate, explaining that the party must retrieve three magical items: a Fomorian's Stone Skull, The Eye of Cathrac, and the Crown of Annwn. Once these items have been acquired, the party journeys to the Spire of Ages, where the Celts aid the Faerie leader in escaping this world, while the Romans attempt to interrupt him. In the \\"best\\" ending for both sides, Shadow Valley Fort is destroyed, the village of Nethergate is evacuated, and the enchanted weapons meant for the Celts have been destroyed. Gameplay Nethergate's gameplay is in an isometric view, and is somewhat a stepping stone between that of Blades of Exile and Avernum, as it uses the pseudo-3D of Avernum, with a battle and conversation system which more resembles Blades of Exile. Romans and Celts have unique traits for their statistics. Romans have better armour and weapons than Celts, but Celts have better magic, potion making and general skills for the wilderness. Nethergate is unique among Spiderweb Software games in being the only game to use a spell system consisting of Spell Circles, instead of the \\"Mage\\" and \\"Priest\\" spell system featured in the Exile and Avernum series. Certain Circles have skill restrictions on them based on the character's level of Druidism, skill in other circles, and Faction. These are: *Health Circle ‚Äì available to Celts and Romans, can only be as high as Druidism skill, contains spells used for healing and curing characters *War Circle ‚Äì available to Celts and Romans, can only be as high as Druidism skill, contains spells used for shielding and boosting your characters, as well as causing harm to enemies *Beast Circle ‚Äì available to Celts at start of game, Romans must earn it by completing a quest, may only be as high as War Circle skill for Celts, fixed value for Romans, contains spells for summoning creatures *Craft Circle ‚Äì available to Celts at start of game, Romans must earn it by completing a quest, may only be as high as the War Circle skill for Celts, fixed value for Romans, contains spells for aiding in travel around the game *Spirit Circle ‚Äì available to Celts at beginning of game, Romans must find it, may only be as high as the lower of Craft or Beast circle as Celts, fixed value for Romans, contains spells for damaging magical creatures and blocks *Nether Circle ‚Äì grouping of five spells, which may only be used by the Celts, also the most powerful and hard-to-find spells Reception Nethergate was reviewed in 2000 in Dragon #273 in the \\"Silicon Sorcery\\" column. The editors of Computer Games Strategy Plus nominated Nethergate for their 1999 \\"Role-Playing Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Planescape: Torment. They wrote of Nethergate, \\"Take an old-fashioned role-playing game and add a full-blown editor and voila, instant gameplay. And it gives you more gameplay for your gaming dollar than most commercial games.\\" Nethergate: Resurrection Nethergate: Resurrection, a revamped version of Nethergate, was released for Macintosh on May 21, 2007, with the Windows released later that year on August 9. Changes to the game include: *Use of the Blades of Avernum game engine, which also provides a quest log, a nicer automap, and improved graphical features. *Two new dungeons, several new quests, and many new magic items. *The game is universal on Intel Macintosh and compatible with Windows Vista.

The line was extended to in 1902. The Chiba Prefectural Tako Line began operations on 1 July 1911, connecting Narita with Tako, Chiba. The Narita Railway was nationalised on 1 September 1920, becoming part of the Japanese Government Railway (JGR), and on 1 April 1927, the Chiba Prefectural Tako Line was renamed the Narita Railway Company Tako Line. This line stopped operations on 11 January 1944 due to wartime conditions, and was officially abolished in 1946. After World War II, the JGR became the Japan National Railways (JNR). The station building was reconstructed from 1977‚Äì1979. Scheduled freight operations were suspended from 9 August 1983. The station was absorbed into the JR East network upon the privatization of the Japanese National Railways (JNR) on 1 April 1987. The spur line to Narita Airport was completed on 19 March 1991.

Early life John Coolidge was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, on September 7, 1906. He was the elder of the two children of Calvin Coolidge (1872‚Äì1933), the 30th President of the United States from 1923 to 1929 and Grace Anna Goodhue (1879‚Äì1957), First Lady of the United States from 1923 to 1929. In his autobiography, Calvin Coolidge recorded his impressions of the birth of his first son: \\"The fragrance of the clematis which covered the bay window filled the room like a benediction where the mother lay with her baby. It was all very wonderful to us.\\"Coolidge, p. 95 On July 7, 1924, his younger brother, Calvin Jr., died from blood poisoning. John rarely spoke of the tragedy beyond acknowledging the terrible sadness it caused the family, especially his father.On the afternoon of June 30, 1924, he was playing tennis with his brother, Calvin Jr., on the White House grounds when Calvin Jr. suffered a blister on his right foot because he wore his tennis shoes without socks, which became infected and progressed into blood poisoning, resulting in his death a week later. John described the loss of his brother as producing a depression in President Coolidge that lasted the rest of his life. As John Coolidge told Life magazine in 1992: \\"Though father was tenderhearted, he rarely showed his feelings. But when they were taking my brother's casket from the White House after the services, my father broke down and wept momentarily. Calvin was my father's favorite. It hurt him terribly. It hurt us all.\\" Coolidge attended Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania and graduated in 1924. He then enrolled at Amherst College, his father's alma mater, graduating in 1928, graduating from both schools while his father was President of the United States. Career He was an executive with the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. He served as president of the Connecticut Manifold Forms Company until 1960, when he reopened the Plymouth Cheese Corporation in Plymouth at the historic village. He helped start the Coolidge Foundation and his gifts of buildings, land, and artifacts were instrumental in creating the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site. Well into his 80s, Coolidge was seen shuttling back and forth from his home near the Calvin Coolidge Historical Site to collect his mail at the old post office located on the historic site. He was reportedly a charming and excited talker who would still answer visitors' questions about his father or his family, and who would, on occasion, give a rare personal interview. Personal life On September 23, 1929, at Plainville, Connecticut, he married Florence Trumbull. She was born on November 30, 1904, at Plainville, Connecticut, the daughter of Connecticut governor John H. Trumbull and Maud Pierce Usher. The Coolidges had two daughters: *Cynthia Coolidge Jeter (1933‚Äì1989)Feldman, p. 100 *Lydia Coolidge Sayles (1939-2001) Florence died on February 15, 1998 at Plymouth Notch, Vermont, and Coolidge died on May 31, 2000 at Lebanon, Grafton County, New Hampshire.

They were the French Fort Sandoske (built 1749-1750), the British Fort Sandusky (1761), and the American Fort Sandusky (1812, later renamed as Fort Stephenson). In addition, there were both English and French colonial trading posts. The short-lived English trading post known as Fort Sandusky (1745-1748) was erected on the north side of the bay. Before 1754 French traders built a trading post on the south bank of Sandusky Bay and east of the Sandusky River, known as Fort Junandat. The latter was shown on an 1855 map of the Middle Colonies by Lewis Evans published in Philadelphia. In some French records the bay is called Lac Junandat because of this post. About this time the French also had a trading post at a Wyandot village on the Sandusky River several miles upriver from its mouth at the bay. Background The Sandusky Bay area was a trading area where the French and English colonists competed for Native American trade. It was known to the French as Lac Sandosk√© or Otsandosk√©, as transliterated from Wyandot terms for \\"water\\" and \\"big water\\". There were a number of Wyandot, or Huron, villages in the area, where the Iroquoian-speaking Wyandot were predominant. Orontony, a Wyandot chief also called Nicolas by the French, had settled here in the 1740s, and emerged as a leader. Nicolas gave permission to English traders from Pennsylvania to build a trading post, which they called Fort Sandusky, on the northern shore of Sandusky Bay in 1745. It was near the carrying or portage place across the peninsula, between the bay and the Portage River at Lake Erie. This was the first such European post in Ohio Country. The English were reportedly driven off by French soldiers from Fort Detroit in 1748-1749, as the French tried to control trade in this area. Fort Sandosk√© The French replaced the blockhouse with a fort, called Fort Sandosk√©, at a site now within Ottawa County, Ohio. From about 1749 or 1750 to around 1753, Fort Sandosk√© (misleadingly referred to as \\"Fort Sandusky\\" in English and on Evans' map of 1755) was a French military fort on the northwest side of Sandusky Bay. It stood near the Bay, and somewhere southerly and easterly of the current City of Port Clinton, Ohio. This fort is known to have been abandoned by 1754. By 1754, the French had also established Fort Junandat, a trading post on the south side of Sandusky Bay (which they called Lac Sandosk√© in some records). It was within present-day Erie County, Ohio. With tensions rising as a result of the Seven Years' War in Europe, Gaspard- Joseph Chaussegros de L√©ry, a French lieutenant and engineer in Quebec, was dispatched from Presqu' Isle (Erie, Pennsylvanai) to Fort Detroit in 1754 with regular reinforcements from Quebec. He knew of Fort Sandosk√©, referring to it in his campaign journal, which gave a detailed account of his activities and journey (this and seven others are held by Laval University in Quebec). By 1754 he noted that little remained of the Fort Sandosk√© but ruins. He took his forces on a portage from this area north across the peninsula to Lake Erie. In his journal Chaussegros referred to seeing evidence of French traders and their families at Fort Junandat, diagonally to the southeast across the bay from the former site of Ft. Sandusky. He drew the plan of the former Fort Sandosk√© in his campaign journal for 1754. He described the post Fort Junandat as near what is known as Pickerel Creek, later within Townsend Township, Sandusky County. Because of erosion, the site of Fort Junandat disappeared into the bay. Most fighting in the French and Indian War in North America ended by 1760 after the fall of Quebec to the British. The victorious British began to take possession of forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region that were previously occupied by the French. The British 1758 Treaty of Easton with Ohio Country Indians promised that no additional forts would be built in their territory. But in 1761 British General Jeffery Amherst ordered the erection of Fort Sandusky on Sandusky Bay in order to strengthen the line of defense from Fort Detroit, near the western end of Lake Erie, to central Lake Erie, and to Fort Pitt at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which controlled access to the Ohio River and the western frontier of the British colonies. The Seven Years' War continued in Europe until 1763 between Britain and France.  British Fort Sandusky (1761-1763)  Fort Sandusky was a small British fort established on the southeastern shore of Sandusky Bay off Lake Erie in present-day Erie County. A European-American town later developed near there. During Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763, when a regional coalition of American Indians, primarily Wyandot, tried to expel the British, they first attacked and then laid siege to Fort Detroit. The Wyandot and allies then attacked other forts in the region, taking control of Fort Sandusky. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandot gained entry to the fort under the pretense of holding a council with the British, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. Alone with the commander, chiefs seized him while warriors killed the fifteen-man garrison. They also killed a number of British traders and burned the fort, looting it first for stores. Summary There has been considerable confusion about the forts of the same name in two different languages, with a great variety of spellings, especially as the name also referred to a trading post and not a military installation. The sequence was the English trading post Fort Sandusky on the north side of the bay, replaced by the French Fort Sandosk√©, both in Ottawa County. The French trading post Fort Junandat was on the south side of the bay, as was the British Fort Sandusky with a 15-man garrison, built in 1761 after they defeated France in North America. Both were in present-day Erie County. The last Fort Sandusky was built about 1812 on the Lower Sandusky River southwest of the bay, and its name was later changed to Fort Stephenson. It was in Sandusky County, Ohio.  See also  * List of Indian massacres  References  External links *\\"Fort Sandusky\\", Ohio History Central]. It erroneously says that the Fort Sandusky on the south shore was destroyed in 1761 and rebuilt, before being taken by Indians in 1763 in Pontiac's Rebellion. Fort Sandosk√© (1750‚Äì53) was built on the north side of the bay by the French after they expelled the English from their trading post. The website shows a drawing of the plan for the French Fort Sandosk√© (1750-1753), which was abandoned by 1754. A second drawing is for the larger Fort Sandusky (1812) that was renamed as Fort Stephenson; it was built during the War of 1812 on the Lower Sandusky River at the falls upriver from the bay, at what developed as Fremont, Ohio.

Targets Defence Scheme No. 1 was created on April 12, 1921, and detailed a surprise invasion of the northern United States as soon as possible after evidence was received of an American invasion of Canada. It assumed that the Americans would first attempt to capture Montreal and Ottawa and then Hamilton, Toronto, the Prairie Provinces, and Vancouver and the rest of Southwestern British Columbia. Defence Scheme No. 1's American counterpart was War Plan Red, a plan to invade Canada as part of a war with Britain that was created in 1930. The purpose of invading America was to allow time for Canada to prepare its war effort and to receive aid from Britain. According to the plan, Canadian flying columns stationed in Pacific Command in western Canada would immediately be sent to seize Seattle, Spokane, and Portland. Troops stationed in Prairie Command would be sent to attack Fargo and Great Falls, then move to Minneapolis. Troops from Quebec would be sent to seize Albany in a surprise counterattack while Maritime troops would attack Maine. When resistance to the Canadians grew they would retreat to their own borders, destroying bridges and railways to hinder American pursuit. Reconnaissance Brown himself did reconnaissance for the plan, along with other lieutenant- colonels, all in plainclothes from 1921 and 1926. As historian Pierre Berton noted in his book Marching as to War, the investigation had \\"a zany flavour about it, reminiscent of the silent comedies of the day.\\" To illustrate that, Berton quoted from Brown's reports, in which Brown recorded, among other things, that in Burlington, Vermont, the people were \\"affable\\" and thus unusual for Americans; that Americans drink significantly less alcohol than Canadians (it was during Prohibition), and that upon pointing out that to Americans, one responded, \\"My God! I'd go for a glass of beer. I'm going to 'Canady' to get some more\\"; that the people of Vermont would be serious soldiers only \\"if aroused;\\" and that many Americans might be sympathetic with the British cause. Reaction Despite Berton's description of the plan and its creator as \\"quixotic\\", Berton notes the plan had its supporters, such as General George Pearkes, who remarked that Defence Scheme No. 1 was a \\"fantastic desperate plan [which] just might have worked.\\" Christopher M. Bell, however, criticized the plan as \\"suicidal.\\" Since Brown did not coordinate with the British, he did not know that the British military did not plan to send a large army to Canada on the grounds of not being able to defend its territory against the much larger United States. His plan would thus have sacrificed the best Canadian troops for no reason. Brown also did not understand the importance of keeping Halifax, Nova Scotia, one of the main targets of an American invasion, and other Atlantic ports open. Bell states that Canada's best strategy would have been, as the Americans expected, to engage in a defensive war. In 1928, Defence Scheme No. 1 was terminated by Chief of the General Staff Andrew McNaughton, who sought peaceful US-British relations. Many of the documents relating to the scheme were accordingly destroyed. While never fully justified, when declassified information about the United States' War Plan Red was released, Defence Scheme No. 1 demonstrated the foresight of such an operation, especially in that it was prepared before War Plan Red was researched.

McKay,Ex parte H.V. McKay (1907) 2 CAR 1. commonly referred to as the Harvester case, is a landmark Australian labour law decision of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The case arose under the Excise Tariff Act 1906. which contained a proviso that excise would not be payable on products if a manufacturer paid \\"fair and reasonable\\" wages to its employees. The Court therefore had to consider what was a \\"fair and reasonable\\" wage for the purpose of the proviso. H.B. Higgins declared that \\"fair and reasonable\\" wages for an unskilled male worker required a living wage that was sufficient for \\"a human being in a civilised community\\" to support a wife and three children in \\"frugal comfort\\", while a skilled worker should receive an additional margin for their skills, regardless of the employer's capacity to pay. While the High Court of Australia in 1908 held that the Excise Tariff Act 1906 was invalid in R v Barger,. the judgment nevertheless continued to be the basis for the minimum wage system that extended to half of the Australian workforce in less than 20 years. The decision was credited as the foundation for the national minimum wage included in the Fair Work Act 2009.. As well as national ramifications, the decision was of international significance. Background In 1906 the second Deakin government was in power, with support from the Labor party. Prime Minister Deakin's \\"New Protection\\" policy was to provide tariff protection to employers in exchange for \\"fair and reasonable\\" wages for employees. In implementing this policy, the Commonwealth government introduced two bills, requires separate laws that deal exclusively with customs and with excise. that would become the Customs Tariff Act 1906,. and the Excise Tariff Act 1906, Higgins was a member of the Australian Parliament and spoke in support of the bills that imposed custom and excise duties that were payable on certain agricultural machinery, including stripper harvesters. The Excise Tariff Act 1906 contained a proviso that the excise would not be payable if the manufacturer paid \\"fair and reasonable\\" wages as follows: > Provided that this Act shall not apply to goods manufactured by any person > in any part of the Commonwealth under conditions as to remuneration of > labour which‚Äî > > 1. are declared by resolution of both Houses of Parliament to be fair and > reasonable; or > 2. are in accordance with an industrial award under the Commonwealth > Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904,; or > 3. are in accordance with the terms of an industrial agreement filed under > the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904; or > 4. are, on an application made for the purpose to the President of the > Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, declared to be fair and > reasonable by him or by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State or any > person or persons who compose a State Industrial Authority to whom he may > refer the matter. =H. B. Higgins= H. B. Higgins had been a member of the Parliament of Victoria and in 1896 supported the trial introduction of a minimum wage. He successfully argued at the 1897-1898 conventions that the constitution should contain a guarantee of religious freedom, and also a provision giving the federal government the power to make laws relating to the conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes. The industrial disputes proposal was initially unsuccessful, H Higgins at p. 782, vote at p. 793, 12 in favour, including Higgins & Isaacs, 22 opposed, including Barton & O'Connor. however Higgins was undeterred and succeeded in 1898. vote at p. 212, 22 in favour, including Higgins & Isaacs, 19 opposed, including Barton & O'Connor. Despite these successes, Higgins J had opposed the draft constitution produced by the convention as too conservative, and campaigned unsuccessfully to have it defeated at the 1899 Australian constitutional referendum. After the federation of Australia, Higgins was a member of the Australian Parliament as a member of the Protectionist Party, but was in broad agreement with the Labor party's social reforms. When the Labor Party sought to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to cover state railway employees, Higgins was one of the radicals who supported the amendments and helped bring down Deakin's government. When Labor formed a minority government in 1904, Higgins became Attorney-General in the Labor ministry, because Labor had no suitably qualified lawyer in Parliament. In October 1906 Higgins was appointed to the High Court and the following year O'Connor J resigned as President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and was replaced by Higgins J. =Hugh Victor McKay= Elmore, Victoria, Australia. Hugh Victor McKay was one of Australia's largest employers, manufacturing agricultural machinery, most notably the Sunshine Harvester. McKay had a reputation for discouraging union membership, and had previously closed his factory at Ballarat and moved to the Sunshine Harvester Works to avoid paying workers under the determination of a wages board. Under the Excise Tariff Act 1906, he was required to pay an excise tax unless he paid wages that were fair and reasonable. McKay applied to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for a declaration that the wages paid by him were fair and reasonable.Ex parte in the case name is used to indicate \\"on the application\\" of McKay, not in the alternate sense of being heard in the absence of a party. The hearing in the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration McKay's was one of 112 applications by manufacturers of agricultural machinery in Victoria and his application was selected as a test case because the factory was one of the largest, and had the greatest number and variety of employees and because his application was strongly opposed by various unions.The unions were the Agricultural Implement Makers‚Äô Society; the Amalgamated Ironmoulders; the Amalgamated Iron Foundry Employees; Tinssmiths‚Äô and Iron-workers‚Äô Society; and the Iron-workers‚Äô Assistants‚Äô Society, the Federated Sawmill, Timber Yard, and General Woodworkers‚Äô Union; the Amalgamated Carpenters; the Coachbuilders‚Äô and the Wheelwrights‚Äô Society and the Certificated Engine-drivers. Other applicants were told that the Court, in dealing with their application, would be limited to the information obtained in McKay's hearing unless there was some exceptional circumstances. Several large manufacturers were represented in the hearing, but did not call any evidence. The hearing took place in Melbourne over 20 days between 7 October 1907 to 1 November 1907. =The evidence and arguments= McKay's case was that fair and reasonable wages should be calculated according to the worth of each individual to the business and led evidence from eight witnesses, including from the factory superintendent, McKay's brother George. George McKay's evidence was that the workers received fair and reasonable wages that took into account their level of skill, experience, age, qualifications, complexity of work, equipment used, and level of danger. The employees at the Sunshine Harvester factory required less skill, judgement and discretion because of mechanisation which had simplified and standardised the work. The unions, represented by Duffy and Arthur, led evidence from employees of McKay's factory and also their wives, union officials and others dealing with everything from the conditions at the factory and elsewhere to the cost of living, including the \\"reasonable enjoyments that a man enjoys in that state of life\\". Higgins J gave his judgment on 8 November 1907. =The decision= Higgins J held that for McKay to pay a fair and reasonable wage meant paying his employees a wages that met \\"the normal needs of an average employee, regarded as a human being in a civilised community\\", regardless of his capacity to pay. This gave rise to the legal requirement for a basic wage. In defining a 'fair and reasonable wage', Higgins (without explicit acknowledgement) employed Pope Leo XIII's Rerum novarum of 1891, an open letter to all the bishops that addressed the condition of the working classes.Kevin Blackburn, The living wage in Australia: a secularization of Catholic ethics on wages, 1891‚Äì1907, Journal of Religious History 20 (1996), 93-113. Higgins ruled that remuneration \\"must be enough to support the wage earner in reasonable and frugal comfort.\\" A 'fair and reasonable' minimum wage for unskilled workers of 7/- (7 shillings), which is around 70 cents, or 42/- per week. Later surveys showed that this minimum was adequate to provide subsistence. Higgins's judgment read as follows: > One finds that the Legislation has not indicated what is meant by 'fair and > reasonable,' what is the model or criterion by which fairness and > reasonableness are to be determined. It is to be regretted that the > Legislature has not given a definition of the words. It is the function of > the Legislature, not of the Judiciary, to deal with social and economic > problems; it is for the Judiciary to apply, and, when necessary, interpret > the enactments of the Legislature. But here this whole controversial > problem, with its grave social and economic bearings, has been committed to > a judge, who is not, at least directly, responsible, and who ought not to be > responsible to public opinion. even if the delegation of duties should be > successful in this case, it by no means follows that it will be so > hereafter. I do not protest against the difficulty of the problem, but > against the confusion of functions and against the failure to define, the > shunting of legislative responsibility. It would be almost as reasonable to > tell a Court to do what is 'right' with regard to real estate, and yet lay > down no laws or principles for its guidance. In the course of the long > discussion of this case, I have been convinced that the President of this > Court is put in a false position. The strength of the Judiciary in the > public confidence is largely owing to the fact that the judge has not to > devise great principles of action as between great classes, or to lay down > what is fair and reasonable between contending interests in the community; > but has to carry out mandates of the Legislature evolved out of the conflict > of public opinion after debate in Parliament. I venture to think that it > will not be found wise to bring the judicial department within the range of > political fire.... The provision for 'fair and reasonable' remuneration is > obviously designed for the benefit of the employees in the industry; and it > must be meant to secure to them something which they cannot get by the > ordinary system of individual bargaining with employers.... The standard of > 'fair and reasonable' must therefore be something else, and I cannot think > of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of an average > employee, regarded as a human being in a civilised community. If, instead of > individual bargaining, one can conceive of a collective agreement ‚Äì an > agreement between all the employers in a given trade on the one side, and > all the employees on the other ‚Äì it seems to me that the framers of the > agreement would have to take as the first and dominant factor the cost of > living as a civilised being. If A lets B have the use of his horses on the > terms that he gives them fair and reasonable treatment, I have no doubt that > it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest > as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, surely > the State in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the > employees means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, > and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human > standards. Higgins also said the following. > I regard the applicant's undertaking as a marvel of enterprise, energy and > pluck‚Ä¶ he is allowed ‚Äì if my view of the Act is correct ‚Äì to make any > profits that he can and they are not subject to investigation. But when he > chooses, in the course of his economies, to economise at the expense of > human life, when his economy involves the withholding from his employees of > reasonable remuneration, or reasonable conditions of human existence, then, > as I understand the Act, Parliament insists on the payment of the Excise > duty. Higgins J thought the probable effect of the decision would be that McKay must elect between paying wages according to the standard he set or paying the excise duties. McKay did neither and both McKay and another manufacturer of agricultural machinery in Melbourne, William Barger, were prosecuted by the Commonwealth for failing to pay the excise. The defences of Barger and McKay included an objection that the Excise Act 1906 was invalid. That objection was referred to the Full Court of the High Court for hearing. While this is sometimes referred to as an appeal, this was not a direct challenge to the Harvester judgement and Higgins sat as one of the five judges in the High Court. Excise Act 1906 struck down by the High Court The High Court found in R v Barger (1908) that the Excise Act 1906, which gave rise to Higgins's decision, was constitutionally invalid because the legislation was essentially concerned with the regulation of employment conditions, a power not held by the Commonwealth Parliament and not capable of being supported by the excise power. The High Court further found a tax based on compliance with certain labour conditions which could differ from State to State was a discrimination within the meaning of section 51(ii) and a preference within the meaning of section 99. Significance The judgment dominated Australian economic life for the next 60 to 80 years. Higgins's 1907 Harvester decision was regarded as a benchmark in Australian labour law. Despite the High Court's reversal in R v Barger, Higgins regarded the minimum wage as sacrosanct and applied the Harvester reasoning to subsequent judgments in his career as president of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke described the Harvester judgment as foundationally important, stating \\"The philosophy was so right and so in tune with the Australian ethos that it spread. And not just through federal jurisdiction - it became embraced by various state jurisdictions. I think it is impossible to overstate the significance of both the judgement and its author, Henry Bournes Higgins.\\". Conservative commentator Gerard Henderson was critical of the decision, describing it as a deeply flawed decision representing a failed policy that was strong on sentiment that failed to consider the ability of employers to pay nor acknowledged geographical differences in the cost of living. =Contemporaneous reaction= Then, as now, the reaction to the Harvester decision was mixed. The Worker described it as a triumph of Equity and that it marked the beginning of an epoch, with the inclusion of the last phase of human life left outside the scope of law. =McKay's criticism= In response to the High Court decision, McKay stated \\"The Excise Act was declared to be ultra vires - The Federal Parliament had gone beyond its powers, all the ingenuity and eloquence spent on the measure, all the litigation devoted to its practical enforcement, and all the elaborate conditions laid down by the Arbitration Court and by the Customs authorities, crumbled to nothing.\\"Hugh Victor McKay, Museum of Victoria, Old Mckay Archives, B6/81 In 1922, McKay wrote to Prime Minister Hughes on the subject of wages boards and collective bargaining, stating \\"I do not agree with the basic wage for the Commonwealth. In other parts of the world it is a minimum wage for the minimum man and a maximum wage for the maximum man - each man according to his ability and capacity. God did not make men equal - it is no use trying to pretend He did, or to make laws as though He did, or to pay people according to their requirements instead of according to their services.\\" =No equal pay for women= The Court determined that a fair and reasonable wage was to be determined according to the needs of a male worker not according to the worker's value to the employer. What then was a fair and reasonable wage for a female worker? Higgins J considered this in 1912 in the Fruit pickers case,Rural Workers‚Äô Union v Mildura Branch of the Australian Dried Fruits Association (Fruit pickers case) (1912) 6 CAR 61. rejecting an application for equal pay for women, deciding that this would represent equal pay for unequal work. His Honour held that women should only be awarded the full male rate where there was the risk of cheap female labour displacing men, setting a common rate for fruit pickers of 1 shilling per hour. The work of packing at the factory was \\"essentially adapted for women with their superior deftness and the suppleness of fingers\\" and this apparently justified a lower minimum wage of 9 pence per hour, which would provide for the woman's food, shelter and clothing but not that of her family. Until World War II, the female basic wage was, generally speaking, approximately 54 per cent of the male basic wage.Equal Remuneration Case [2011] FWAFB 2700 at [189]. The assumptions of a male bread winner and female domestic carer have been criticised as a deliberate policy of discouraging women in the paid workforce, reflecting a flawed understanding of work and care where the normative worker of the labour market is without responsibilities to care for others. It thus ensured the continuance of the women's inferior place in the paid work force, only entitled to equal wages if their work threatened the position of men.Owens, R Owens, Rosemary J \\"Women, 'Atypical' Work Relationships and the Law\\" [1993] MelbULawRw 18 at .Chapman, A \\"Industrial Law, Working Hours and Work, Care and Family\\" [1993] MonashULawRw 31.

Although not a part of official Seventh-day Adventist theology, some hold that there will be an end-time remnant of believers who are faithful to God, which will be manifest shortly prior to the second coming of Jesus, as suggested by the 144,000 saints described in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament. Some claim LGT is related to \\"historic Adventism\\", but as one supporter claims, it differs in that it forms an extension or development of \\"historic\\" or mainstream Adventist beliefs,Larry Kirkpatrick, in an interview with Julius Nam or takes them to their logical conclusion. It has similarities to the teachings of John Wesley, in his book A Plain Account of Christian Perfection. Proponents teach that Jesus Christ was not only the Substitute but also the Example for man, and that Christians, through the process of sanctification, have the character of Christ perfectly reproduced in them through the Holy Spirit. But \\"final generation\\" believers hold that God's people will cease from committing sinful acts before the \\"close of probation,\\" and before the \\"time of trouble\\" (Daniel 12:1; Jeremiah 30:7; Isaiah 26:20) just prior to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Most also believe that the close of human probation has been delayed by human sin and unbelief in the \\"Laodicean church,\\" (a cipher for the SDA Church) but can be accelerated through their consistent living of holy lives (consistent obedience to the Ten Commandments by the enabling power of God, through the power of the Holy Spirit) so Christ can come. Seventh-day Adventists teach that, at the end of time, there will be a Christian remnant who are faithful to God in keeping all of His ten commandments, (which includes resting on the seventh-day of the week (Saturday)), and who are progressively sanctified and then sealed as \\"holy\\" and \\"righteous\\"https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1969/10/the-remnant- sinless-when-how before the Second Advent of Christ.\\"each fully surrendered Christian is being changed daily from glory to glory, until, at the Second Advent, his or her transformation into the image of God will be completed.\\" Seventh-day Adventist Believe, A Biblical Exposition of 27 Fundamental Doctrines, p. 125. Last Generation Theology builds on this belief, teaching that it is possible for this \\"last generation\\" of Christian believers to overcome sin like Christ and achieve a state of perfection. This is a key teaching for those who adhere to \\"historic Adventism.\\" This achievement of perfection is believed to have major eschatological implications, by finally settling major questions in the Great Controversy about the character of God and His law. Proponents of Last Generation Theology see it, not as a new belief system, but as forming an extension or development of Seventh-day Adventist beliefs on the remnant,Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine [Washington, DC: Review and Herald,1959], 192; quoted in TRR 164-65 https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1988/02/have-we-delayed-the-advent or taking them to their logical conclusion. Doctrine The Last Generation Theology understanding is best seen in light of the doctrinal development of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Seventh-day Adventists have had four generally recognized statements of belief, prepared in 1872, 1931, 1980, and 2005. The 1872 and 1931 statements of belief were prepared for use at the informational level, for those outside the movement who desired to understand what Seventh-day Adventists stood for. Adventism is rooted in Reformationism and Restorationism, combining elements from Lutheran, Anabaptist and Methodist or Wesleyan/Arminian branches of Protestantism. Adventist theology tends to the Wesleyan/Arminian view of emphasis on sanctification and the possibility of moral perfection in this life.Sinles Saints or Sinless Sinners? by Rolf J. Poehler, page 2 Adventists believe that the events at the end time demonstrate that God in His mercy has provided for a plan of salvation which comes when Christ comes to take His saints to heaven at the Second Coming, and judgement comes on the wicked. In the closing days, God simply recognizes the free and final decision that His created beings have made, and He allows for justice for those who follow the world, and gives eternal life to those who at the end are sealed of God.\\"Those who are uniting with the world are receiving the worldly mold and preparing for the mark of the beast. Those who are distrustful of self, who are humbling themselves before God and purifying their souls by obeying the truth, these are receiving the heavenly mold and preparing for the seal of God in their foreheads\\" (Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 214). Seventh-day Adventists teach that Jesus Christ was not only the Substitute but also the Example for man,\\"By assuming sinful flesh, and voluntarily making Himself dependent upon His Father to keep Him from sin while He was in the world, Jesus not only set the example for all Christians, but also made it possible for Him to minister for sinful flesh the gift of His own Spirit and the power for obedience to the will of God.\\" International Sabbath School Quarterly, \\"The Incarnation and the Priesthood\\" (Senior Division, No. 71, First Quarter. 1913. Pacific Press). 15. and that Christians through the process of sanctification, the character of Christ is perfectly reproduced in them through the transformation power of the Holy Spirit allowing overcoming sin.http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/books/27/27-10.htm Adventist teach that those that overcome sin at the end time will be part of the Remnant that are sealed, but it is at time of the Second Coming of Christ that inbred sin and the scars of sin, and the danger of falling back into sin will be removed. Adventist hold that when a person receives Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour, the imputed righteousness of Christ bestows full forgiveness for all our transgressions in our past life. Then the imparted righteousness of Christ living in their renewed heart, if fully appropriated by faith, will deliver the believer from the dominion of inbred sin and thus keep them from the acts of sin. Seventh-day Adventists hold that Christ is not only our example but shows mankind the path to overcome sin, and to manifest Christ's perfect and righteous character.Seventh-day Adventists Believe. . . #10 \\"Full perfection in Christ. How may we become perfect? The Holy Spirit brings to us the perfection of Christ. By faith Christ's perfect character becomes ours.\\"\\"To be our example. To set the example as to how people should live, Christ must live a sinless life as a human being. As the second Adam He dispelled the myth that humans cannot obey God's law and have victory over sin. He demonstrated that it is possible for humanity to be faithful to God's will. Where the first Adam fell, the second Adam gained the victory over sin and Satan and became both our Saviour and our perfect example. In His strength His victory can be ours (John 16:33)...By beholding Him, people \\"are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory\\" (2 Cor. 3:18). \\"Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith. . . . Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart\\" (Heb. 12:2, 3, NIV). Truly, Christ \\"suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps\\" (1 Peter 2:21; cf. John 13:15).\\"[Seventh-day Adventists Believe, pg 49-50]\\"The urgency for attaining perfection comes from the knowledge that the remnant must live perfectly during the time of trouble at the end to prove to the universe that fallen human beings can keep the law of God. Ellen White states, \\"When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor.\\" (GC 614). They hold to the 28 Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists which in #10 states 'we are given the power to live a holy life' and right before that 'we are born again and sanctified' through the Holy Spirit.http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/doctrines/gc28.htm Proponents of Last Generation Theology believe that end time saints will overcome and cease from sin before the close of probation and before the time of trouble (Daniel chapter 12 verse 1; Jeremiah chapter 30 verse 7; Isaiah chapter 26 verse 20) just prior to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. A few of proponents of Last Generation Theology teach that the close of human probation has been delayed by sin and unbelief in the Laodicean church, but can be hastened through their consistent living of holy lives (consistent obedience to the Ten Commandments by the enabling power of GOD through the power of the Holy Spirit). =The Great Controversy= Seventh-day Adventists consider The Great Controversy to be one of Ellen White's important works, and in addition to the major Adventist publishing houses, the book has also been printed and distributed by various independent initiatives, sometimes under other titles.Some examples are: Will America Survive?, 1988; . Another is America in Prophecy. Remnant Publications reprinted the 1911 paperback version, 196 pages, on December 1, 2001; . The Great Controversy has the following of the perfection of those who stand at the end while Christ still intercedes in the Most Holy Place: \\"The \\"time of trouble, such as never was,\\" is soon to open upon us; and we shall need an experience which we do not now possess and which many are too indolent to obtain. It is often the case that trouble is greater in anticipation than in reality; but this is not true of the crisis before us. The most vivid presentation cannot reach the magnitude of the ordeal. In that time of trial, every soul must stand for himself before God. \\"Though Noah, Daniel, and Job\\" were in the land, \\"as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.\\" Now, while our great High Priest is making the atonement for us, we should seek to become perfect in Christ. Not even by a thought could our Saviour be brought to yield to the power of temptation. . . . This is the condition in which those must be found who shall stand in the time of trouble\\" (GC 622-623). When the third angel's message closes, mercy no longer pleads for the guilty inhabitants of the earth. The people of God have accomplished their work. They have received \\"the latter rain,\\" \\"the refreshing from the presence of the Lord,\\" and they are prepared for the trying hour before them. Angels are hastening to and fro in heaven. An angel returning from the earth announces that his work is done; the final test has been brought upon the world, and all who have proved themselves loyal to the divine precepts have received \\"the seal of the living God.\\" Then Jesus ceases His intercession in the sanctuary above. He lifts His hands and with a loud voice says, \\"It is done;\\" and all the angelic host lay off their crowns as He makes the solemn announcement: \\"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.\\" (GC 613) The urgency for attaining perfection comes from the knowledge that the remnant must live perfectly during the time of trouble at the end to prove to the universe that fallen human beings can keep the law of God. Ellen White states, \\"When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor.\\" (GC 614). And explains this is necessary because the \\"earthliness\\" of the remnant must be cleansed that the image of Christ may be perfectly reflected: \\"God‚Äôs love for His children during the period of their severest trial is as strong and tender as in the days of their sunniest prosperity; but it is needful for them to be placed in the furnace of fire; their earthliness must be consumed, that the image of Christ may be perfectly reflected.\\"(GC 621). And emphasizes that attaining God's blessing will mean denying self: \\"Those who are unwilling to deny self, to agonize before God, to pray long and earnestly for His blessing, will not obtain it. Wrestling with God‚Äìhow few know what it is!\\" (GC 621). Ellen White in her writings does not link perfection to something that happens from the believer, but with what God does for the believer through Christ, and those who try to trust in their own righteousness cannot understand how it comes through Christ. =The Remnant= Adventists believe the term 'remnant' as found in Revelation 12:17 (Christians who \\"keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus\\") an appropriate designation of themselves\\"Since there is not other religious body today outside of Seventh-day Adventists which uniquely and specifically has the characteristics of the remnant of faith and carries their marks, it follows that Adventists as they meet all the aspects of the remnant are the final remnant of faith of the end-time.\\"\\"God's Universal Remnant,\\" Ministry, August 1993, pp. 5-7, 30. and Gerhard F. Hasel, \\"Who are the Remnant?\\" Adventists Affirm Fall 1993, pp. 13, 31. in their work of proclaiming the gospel of Jesus to the world, and inviting people to obey each of the ten commandments of the moral law as a loving response to God's work for them in Jesus Christ.\\"Since Adventism arose from the Millerite expectation of Christ's imminent return, its nature and purpose have always been related to its situation at 'the end of time.' Adventists describe themselves as the 'remnant church' entrusted with God's last warning message to the world.\\" \\"Dominant Themes in Adventist Theology,\\" Spectrum 10.4 (1980):67.\\"Here, then, are the causes of the dragon's warfare upon the remnant. They teach the observance of the ten commandments, and the revival of the gifts, and acknowledge the gift of prophecy among them. When the Devil got one foot upon the fourth commandment, and the other upon the gifts planted in the Christian church b Jesus Christ, then his satanic majesty was filled with revengeful delight. But when the remnant, whom God designs to fit for translation to Heaven without seeing death, 'ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein,' then the dragon is wroth, and makes war on them. \\"The true spirit of the dragonic host, which is already being somewhat developed, is vividly described in Isa. xxx, 8-13, as being manifested just prior to the sudden destruction of those who hate the pure testimony, and love smooth and deceitful things.\\" E. G. White, Spiritual Gifts, Vol. III, 26, 27. Hence, the remnant is an identifiable and visible Christian movement at the end time who are faithful to God, which will be manifest shortly prior to the second coming of Jesus and are sealed.http://perspectives.adventist.org/sermons/sermons/go/2010-07-03/wilson- calls-adventists-to-go-forward-1/6/ Ellen White states, ‚ÄúNow is the time to prepare. The seal of God will never be placed upon the forehead of an impure man or woman. It will never be placed upon the forehead of the ambitious, world-loving man or woman. It will never be placed upon the forehead of men or women of false tongues or deceitful hearts. All who receive the seal must be without spot before God -- candidates for heaven..‚Äù Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, Page 216 =144,000= Ellen White counseled the church that the identity of the 144,000 was not something that should allow division. Ellen White wrote: ‚ÄúIt is not His [God‚Äôs] will that they shall get into controversy over questions which will not help them spiritually, such as, Who is to compose the hundred and forty-four thousand? This those who are the elect of God will in a short time know without question.‚Äù Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 174. Ellen White in the Great Controversy page 623, gives descriptions of those who stand at the end while Christ still intercedes in the Most Holy Place: ‚ÄúNow, while our great High Priest is making the atonement for us, we should seek to become perfect in Christ. Not even by a thought could our Saviour be brought to yield to the power of temptation. Satan finds in human hearts some point where he can gain a foothold; some sinful desire is cherished, by means of which his temptations assert their power. But Christ declared of Himself: \\"The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in Me.\\" John 14:30. Satan could find nothing in the Son of God that would enable him to gain the victory. He had kept His Father's commandments, and there was no sin in Him that Satan could use to his advantage. This is the condition in which those must be found who shall stand in the time of trouble. ‚ÄúEllen G. White, Great Controversy, p. 623. =Christology - The human nature of Jesus Christ= Seventh-day Adventists teach, as well as some Last Generation Theology proponents such as Larry Kirkpatrick Half Adam? a sermon by Larry Kirkpatrick covering the nature of Christ, that Jesus Christ was born with Adam's fallen nature that has been passed on to all of humanity but without the propensity to sin.Christ's Human Nature by Joe Crews Such a belief is based on the following texts, :\\"For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh\\" Romans 8:3 (NKJV) :\\"For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.\\" Hebrews 4:15 (NKJV) :\\"...concerning his Son (Jesus), who was descended from David according to the flesh...\\" Romans 1:3 (ESV) :\\"Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.\\" Hebrews 2:17 NKJV Despite this, he managed to resist temptation both from within and without, and lived a perfectly obedient life. Jesus is therefore set forth as the supreme Example in whose footsteps Christians must follow. The fact that he overcame sin completely, despite having no advantage over other human beings, demonstrates that we too can live a life of complete obedience by trusting in him. Ellen White states, Progressive Adventist tend to disagree strongly with the belief that Christ was our example as well as substitute and also of \\"eschatological perfectionism,\\" the teaching that a final generation of believers must achieve a state of complete sinlessness (or Christlikeness) in the final period just before the second coming of Jesus when the saints are sealed. =Original Sin= Adventist as well as Last Generation Theology does not believe in \\"original sin\\" or \\"ancestral sin\\", but holds to the Adventist doctrinal view, that while damaged by Adam's fall, sin occurs in the actual sins that a person commits. Adventist hold that sin is the transgression of the law of God in thought, word, or deed and teach that the word \\"sin\\" is also used to denote the sinful nature that every person inherits at birth as a consequence of Adam's disobedience.\\"Because of sin his posterity was born with inherent propensities of disobedience.\\"‚ÄîThe SDA Bible Commentary, Ellen G. White Comments, on John 1:1-3, 14, p. 1128. They look at text from scripture: \\"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me\\" (Ps. 51:5), and hold to the belief that the word \\"sin\\" given here does not mean any transgression of the law. There was no act of transgression when David was conceived by his mother in holy wedlock. Sin in this case means inbred sin. It refers to the sinful nature with which every person is born. Thus sin is set forth in a twofold aspect. It is a transgression of the law in thought, word, or action. Or it may refer to inbred sin, or the sinful flesh. Seventh-day Adventists teach and have historically preached a doctrine of inherited weakness, but not a doctrine of inherited guilt.E. G. White, Signs of the Times, August 29, 1892 Adventists believe that humans are sinful primarily due to the fall of Adam,The SDA Bible Commentary, vol.5, p.1081, 1128-1131. but they do not accept the Augustinian/Calvinistic understanding of original sin, taught in terms of original guilt. According to Augustine and Calvin, humanity inherits not only Adam's depraved nature but also the actual guilt of his transgression, and Adventists look more toward the Wesleyan model. In part, the Adventist position on original sin reads: > \\"The nature of the penalty for original sin, i.e., Adam's sin, is to be seen > as literal, physical, temporal, or actual death ‚Äì the opposite of life, > i.e., the cessation of being. By no stretch of the scriptural facts can > death be spiritualised as depravity. God did not punish Adam by making him a > sinner. That was Adam‚Äôs own doing. All die the first death because of Adam‚Äôs > sin regardless of their moral character ‚Äì children included.\\" Early Adventists (such as George Storrs, Ellen White and Uriah Smith) tended to de-emphasise the corrupt nature inherited from Adam, while stressing the importance of actual, personal sins committed by the individual. Adventism looks at the \\"sinful nature\\" in terms of physical mortality rather than moral depravity as those who believe in original sin. Traditionally, Adventists look at sin in terms of willful transgressions. They base their belief on texts such as \\"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.\\" (1 John 3:4)Questions on Doctrines Documents via Andrews University Adventist Joe Crews states... Seventh-day Adventists have historically preached a doctrine of inherited weakness, but not a doctrine of inherited guilt. Adventists believe that humans are sinful primarily due to the fall of Adam, but they do not accept the Augustinian/Calvinistic understanding of original sin, taught in terms of original guilt. According to Augustine and Calvin, humanity inherits not only Adam's depraved nature but also the actual guilt of his transgression, and Adventists look more toward the Wesleyan model. Adventists hold to the belief that sin is wilful transgression of God's law. Sin is a choice. They base their belief on scripture such as \\"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.\\" (1 John 3:4) Are We Born Saved or Lost? See quote in article \\"Wilful choice makes one a sinner (1 John 3:4; Isaiah 59:2).\\" = Victory Over Sin = Seventh-Day Adventist hold that we will have victory over sin, and that we must be a sanctified individual before we are taken to heaven and quote the following verse. ‚ÄúBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.‚Äù Matthew 5:48. Others point out that the perfection spoke of this verse is not of personal piety but equanimity or disinterested benevolence, just as the Father permits the rain to fall, or sun to shine, on \\"both the just and unjust\\". Matt 5:48 Last Generation Theology in accord with mainstream Seventh-Day Adventist belief holds that true followers of Christ will need to cease from sin before the second coming of Christ,Victory Over Sin and look to text such as Revelation 2:11: Seventh-day Adventists believe that at the close of probation the righteous saints will be sealed and be held righteous from text such as Revelation 22:11: The Adventist Church has, through the decades of the past, taken the position that those who overcome their sins will have them blotted out of the books of record in the judgment. The saints who are alive at the close of probation will be sealed as \\"holy\\" and \\"righteous.\\" Thus they will be kept from sin when there is no intercessor when Christ leaves heaven to come to earth and the books of judgment have been finalized. Then at the Second Coming the mortal body with its sinful flesh will be changed into an immortal body with sinless flesh. However, LGT Adventists tend to focus on the sanctified life as the power which will enable them to achieve this feat, while Adventism traditionally holds that it is in looking to the imputed righteousness of Christ and uplifting justification by faith in the imputed merits of Christ that one will enable one to stand spotless upon that day. In regard to preparation for the time of trouble, Ellen White says, > \\"The time of test is just upon us, for the _loud cry of the third angel_ has > already begun in the revelation of _the righteousness of Christ, the sin- > pardoning Redeeme_ r. This is the beginning of the light of the angel whose > glory shall fill the whole earth. If you would _stand through the time of > trouble,_ you must know Christ and appropriate the gift of _His > righteousness_ , which _He imputes_ to the repentant sinner.\\" The Seventh-day Adventist Church teaches and Adventist believe that one can achieve victory over sin through the power of Christ and not of one's own power. They therefore believe that victory over sin is possible in this lifetime.Sabbath School Quarterly, \\"Victory Over Sin\\" . It bases its belief on a wide range of Bible texts such as... Ellen G. White, considered to be a women inspired by God, wrote: =Salvation= While Ellen White speaks of the sanctification of Christ's church and its members and Adventist theology tends to the Wesleyan/Arminian view of emphasis on sanctification,\\"Christ has made every provision for the sanctification of His Church. He has made abundant provision for every soul to have such grace and strength that he will be more than a conqueror in the warfare against sin. The Saviour is wounded afresh and put to open shame when His people pay no heed to His word. He came to this world and lived a sinless life, that in His power His people might also live lives of sinlessness. He desires them by practising the principles of truth to show to the world that God's grace has power to sanctify the heart\\" Review and Herald December 14, 1906 it is claimed that Last Generation Theology Adventists tend to place a greater emphasis on sanctification than just justification, believing that both are necessary for salvation; this view is often described as \\"righteousness by faith\\".Current Issues In Justification by Dennis Priebe Adventist theologian Richard Rice, speaking on views of salvation in Adventism says, \\"the Reformers themselves held that justification and sanctification are inseparable\\". page 65 Adventists look to text in scripture such as... Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. ~ 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 21 envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. 24 And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. ~ Galatians 5:19-24 =Atonement= The Seventh-day Adventist church teaches that there is a sanctuary in heaven which was foreshadowed by the Mosaic tabernacle, according to their interpretation of the Epistle to the Hebrews chapters 8 and 9. After his death, resurrection and ascension, Jesus Christ entered the heavenly sanctuary as the great High Priest, \\"making available to believers the benefits of His atoning sacrifice\\" (Fundamental Belief no. 24). Adventists hold that Christ ministered his blood in the first section of the sanctuary (the holy place) until October 1844; after that time he entered the second section of the sanctuary (the Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies) in fulfillment of the Day of Atonement. Adventists therefore believe that Christ's work of atonement encompasses both his death on the Cross and his ministration in the heavenly sanctuary. Thus Adventist doctrine defines the atonement in terms of God's continuing work as well as payment of the penalty for sin at the cross. The work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary is regarded as a continuation of the work of atonement begun on the cross, rather than the application of the benefits of an already completed atonement. For example, it is written... Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. ~ Romans 8:33-34 Seventh-day Adventists teach and emphasize the two parts to the atonement and refer to his mediatorial work in heaven as an \\"atoning ministry\\" (as in Fundamental Belief no. 24).See also Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia, Review and Herald Publishing Assn, pages 127-129 The completion of this ministry by Christ in the heavenly sanctuary will mark the close of human probation before the Second Advent. Last Generation Theology emphasizes that this ministration of Christ in the Most Holy Place of the sanctuary, is a continuation of His work of \\"atonement\\" in cleansing the characters of His people from sin. Last Generation Theology holds that this third and final phase of atonement completes the unfinished atonement made by Christ on the cross, a view that was promoted as early as the 1860s by Joseph Waggoner.http://www.andrews.edu/~fortind/Waggoner&White.htm; Most Seventh-day Adventists, by contrast, understand Christ's heavenly ministration to be an application of His complete work of atonement on the cross.https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1959/02/the-atonement-in- adventist-theology =Hastening Eschatology= One of the general principles of Last Generation Theology which is not written in the church Fundament Beliefs, is a belief that believers can affect the coming of Christ. Apostle Peter in 2 Peter chapter 3 writes saints should \\"hasten\\" the coming of Christ and Christ is \\"not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance\\". It is claimed that LGT adherents hold that the ultimate defeat of Satan would only be finally effected through the sinlessly perfected remnant of the \\"Last Generation\\" of \\"sealed\\" saints. Andreasen held that such a final victory would be achieved only through the grace which would be imparted from the Christ, Who is ministering in the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary. In other words, this faithful \\"Remnant\\" would develop sinless characters that would replicate the sinlessly perfect life which Christ had wrought out in the very same fallen, sinful nature in which the final generation will have to overcome. Thus Christ defeat of Satan is complete through the remnant's victory, in order to fully and finally vindicate God's demand for perfect obedience; and this end-time vindication of God will finally enable Christ to come and refer to Biblical texts such as 2 Peter 3 and Ellen White's statements in the book Christ's Object Lessons, i.e. page 69: History =Early Pioneers= Millerite Adventists saw the Daniel 8:14 cleansing of the sanctuary as meeting fulfillment on two levels: cleansing the church from sin, and cleansing the earth by fire. After 1844, the early Adventists continued to maintain the concept of a dual cleansing, but now it no longer included the cleansing of the earth. Instead, the cleansing pertained to the heavenly sanctuary and the church.The Sanctuary and Adventist Experience by P. Gerard Damsteegt, Ministry, vol. 67, no. 10, 1994. Adventist sanctuary doctrine gives a twofold meaning to the blood of the sacrifice. The SDA understanding of Old Testament theology in reference to the \\"daily\\" sacrifice defiles the sanctuary, whilst the blood of the sacrifice, pertaining to the yearly Day of Atonement, cleanses the sanctuary. However, in the New Testament, the blood of the sacrifice in SDA sanctuary doctrine is depicted as Jesus Christ's blood which cleanses the sinner from all unrighteousness,High Priestly Application of Atoning Sacrifice-PLEDGES CLEANSING OF EVERY REPENTANT SouL.\\"By pledging His own life, Christ has made Himself responsible for every man and woman on the earth. He stands in the presence of God, saying, Father, I take upon myself the guilt of that soul. It means death to him if he is left to bear it. If he repents, he shall be forgiven. My blood shall cleanse him from all sin. I gave my life for the sins of the world. If the transgressor of God's law will see in Christ his atoning sacrifice, if he will believe in him who can cleanse from all unrighteousness, Christ will not have died for him in vain.\\" ‚ÄîThe Review and Herald, Feb. 27, 1900. yet also transfers sin to the Heavenly Sanctuary to defile the Most Holy Place. From the very beginning, Seventh-day Adventists have held to the belief in overcoming sin, and all who will can be overcomers.[S.D.A. Bible Commentary Vol. 7, Page 974] Ellen White wrote much about the necessity of victory over sin, but did paint the picture of \\"last generation perfection\\" as clearly as subsequent authors. In particular, White does not claim that sinlessness or perfection is a requirement only of the last generation, but of every follower of Christ. Also, White does not make a clear connection between the perfection of the final generation, and the vindication of the character of God before the universe, as do Andreasen and subsequent authors.See E. G. White, Our Father Cares, Page 214, TMK 130 (MS 148,1902)Also, \\"Those only who through faith in Christ obey all of God's commandments will reach the condition of sinlessness in which Adam lived before his transgression.\\"Everyone who surrenders fully to God is given the privilege of living without sin.\\" \\"We need not retain one sinful propensity.\\" \\"Christ died to make it possible for you to cease to sin.\\" \\"To be redeemed means to cease from sin.\\" \\"...Those who are living on the earth when the intercession of Christ shall cease in the sanctuary above are to stand in the sight of a holy God without a mediator. Their robes must be spotless, their characters must be purified from sin by the blood of sprinkling. Through the grace of God and their own diligent effort they must be conquerors in the battle with evil...\\"8 . Ellen White, SDA Commentary, Vol. VI, p. 1118. Review and Herald, Sept. 27, 1906.

The early Adventist pioneers held to the belief of overcoming sin\\"The views of other, pre-1937 Adventist writers were researched primarily with the aid of digitized libraries; the two primary collections used were (1) the second edition of the Adventist Pioneer Library‚Äôs Words of the Pioneers and (2) version 3.0 of the Ellen G.

Conclusions This study found all of the basic components of Andreasen‚Äôs final-generation theology expressed by previous Adventist writers.\\" A Historical-Contextual Analysis of the Final-Generation Theology of M. L. Andreasen by Paul M. Evans and believed \\"that the final generation would become perfected, or sinless, men.\\" http://www.presenttruthmag.com/7dayadventist/SDAPart1/1.html Well-known theologians A. T. Jones and Ellet J. Waggoner were both key participants in the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference Session, a landmark event in the history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In addition to the message of righteousness by faith, A. T. Jones held that Christ was made \\"in all things\\" like unto us, or that He had the fallen nature of mankind after Adam. Because Christ overcame sin as our example, the perfection of character is the Christian goal.The Consecrated Way ‚Äì A.T Jones, pg 28 He also argued that there must be a moral and spiritual perfection of the believers before the end time. In the Consecrated Way, he wrote: \\"Sanctification is the true keeping of all the commandments of God. In other words, this is to say that the will of God concerning man is that His will shall be perfectly fulfilled in man. His will is expressed in His law of ten commandments, which is \\"the whole duty of man.\\" This law is perfect, and perfection of character is the perfect expression of this law in the life of the worshipper of God. By this law is the knowledge of sin. And all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God‚Äîhave come short of this perfection of character....In His coming in the flesh‚Äîhaving been made in all things like unto us and having been tempted in all points like as we are‚ÄîHe has identified Himself with every human soul just where that soul is. And from the place where every human soul is, He has consecrated for that soul a new and living way through all the vicissitudes and experiences of a whole lifetime, and even through death and the tomb, into the holiest of all at the right hand of God for evermore....Perfection, perfection of character, is the Christian goal‚Äîperfection attained in human flesh in this world. Christ attained it in human flesh in this world and thus made and consecrated a way by which, in Him, every believer can attain it. He, having attained it, has become our great High Priest, by His priestly ministry in the true sanctuary to enable us to attain.\\"[The Consecrated Way, A.T Jones. Chapter 12, 43,45] =M. L. Andreasen= Andreasen has been recognized as the denomination's most influential theologian during the 1930s and 1940s. Andreasen held to the traditional Adventist belief, that Christ had taken a sinful human nature, just like Adam‚Äôs after the fall. But Andreasen believed the final atonement could be effected from the heavenly sanctuary through the sinlessly perfected characters of the embattled, last day saints on earth. This final atonement theology was most clearly set forth in the chapter entitled \\"The Last Generation\\" in his well-known book The Sanctuary Service (1937, 1947).The Sanctuary Service (Washington, D. C.: Review and Herald Pub. Assoc., 1947). In this book Andreasen presented his views regarding the atonement and related topics in the closing chapter, \\"The Final Generation\\". Adventists consider the life and character of Christ as a perfect example that all must imitate. M. L. Andreasen felt the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary, or investigative judgment also involve the cleansing of the lives of believers on earth. This belief in sinlessness arose particularly from M. L. Andreasen's interpretation of the investigative judgment doctrine, which he based on concepts found in The Great Controversy by Ellen G. White. In 1957 the church published the major book 'Questions on Doctrine (QOD), after discussions with fundamentalist/evangelical Christian leaders. The book has been the most controversial ever in the history of the Adventist church. Its harshest critic was M. L. Andreasen, who urged church leaders not to publish QOD who felt it presented changes to the church's doctrinal position on the nature of Christ. The controversial parts were the book's view of Christology and the atonement. Proponents of LGT believe the book downplayed the concept that a last generation could, by the power of the gospel, be made holy, and stop sinning. =Robert Pierson= Robert Pierson served as a president of the General Conference from 1966-1979. He was known to advocate the principles of Last Generation Theology during his time.One Robert H. Pierson sermon He was a driving force in the 1973 and 1974 Annual Council Appeals, which called on church members to \\"demonstrate that His way of life can truly be lived on earth\\".http://www.dennispriebe.com/new/node/13 He authored 28 books.Radiant With Hope (biography of Robert H. Pierson), by Geoffrey E. Garne. He wrote, \\"Today, we as God‚Äôs people need to devote more thoughtful, prayerful attention to the work being carried on in our behalf in the heavenly sanctuary. We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement, and God expects much of those who compose His remnant church. \\"While the investigative judgment is going forward in heaven, while the sins of penitent believers are being removed from the sanctuary, there is to be a special work of purification, of putting away of sin, among God‚Äôs people upon earth\\".The Great Controversy, p. 425 In the book Ransom & Reunion Through the Sanctuary, a special \\"work of purification,\\" a special work \\"of putting away of sin,\\" is brought vividly to our attention..God's last-generation people are to reveal the character of Jesus to the world. They will overcome as He overcame. They will be victorious living representatives of the Master. The enabling power to live this life, to achieve this character, comes from Jesus. Only through His imputed and imparted righteousness can we prevail.http://wdfsermons.org/contact/testimonies/ Through the printed pages of the Review & Herald (now Adventist Review) and Ministry magazines, he appealed to the laity and leadership of the denomination to hold fast to teachings of the church reflected in the church's fundamental beliefs, including the doctrine of the work of Jesus Christ as High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, and the concept of the true believers overcoming all their sins, with the aid of God, prior to their baptism with the power of the Holy Spirit (\\"the falling of the Latter Rain\\") to proclaim the Three Angels' Messages of Revelation 14 to the world, calling upon the people to take a stand for \\"the commandments of God (including the seventh-day Sabbath - Saturday) and the faith of Jesus\\". He wrote this theme in his papers and in his sermons, \\"Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself in His church. When the character of Christ is perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to claim them as His own.\\" [Christ's Object Lessons, page 69. Ellen G. White. 1900] =Herbert Douglass= Herbert Douglass was a prominent figure in the 1970s advocating Last Generation Theology, publishing articles in what is now the Adventist Review supporting LGT, along with editor Kenneth H. Wood. He has been a leading theologian within the Adventist church. A key contribution to LGT by Douglass was his articulation of what came to be known as \\"The Harvest Principle\\". Herbert E. Douglass developed essentially the very same concepts but independently of Andreasen. Douglass was writing his editorials in the Review in favor of the same belief, but he had never read Andreasen. Finally, after these editorials he read Andreasen's views and did find much commonality. But Douglass had developed his concepts, just as Andreasen had, via his careful study of Scripture and reading of the Ellen G. White writings. A key contribution by Douglass was his articulation of what came to be known as The Harvest Principle. Pointing to and , Douglass argued that God is waiting for a ripe harvest, and as soon as that harvest \\"is fully ripe\\", He will thrust in His sickle and reap the earth - the Second Coming of Christ will at last come to pass. Douglass also promoted the Great Controversy theme (GCT) as the conceptual key, the organizing principle that leads to an understanding of humanity's greatest questions: How did life begin? Why good and evil, and how does one know the difference? What happens after death? Why suffering and death? The Great Controversy Theme provides the background for the development of evil ‚Äì the story of Lucifer's (Satan's) rebellion against the government of God. The thrust of Satan's argument is that God cannot be trusted, that His law is severe and unfair, and thus the Lawgiver is unfair, severe, and arbitrary. For Douglass, the Great Controversy Theme tied together the plan of redemption, Bible truth, and the peril and triumph of Jesus‚Äô entry into humanity and His death upon the cross. It holds together Christ's death for us with the application of His power within us. It shows why God purposes to demonstrate through His end-time people the ultimate fruition of what His grace can do, and clarifies how Satan's charges will be finally negated. At the end of time God has called a people to understand, live out, and present to the universe God's love through our individual opportunities in the climax of the great controversy. =Ted N. C. Wilson= Elder Ted N. C. Wilson, current General Conference President of Seventh-day Adventists, emphasizes the need for victory over sin before the close of probation and the last generation.http://www.adventistsaffirm.org/article/...3/editorial-the-point- of-no-returnhttp://www.adventistreview.org/church- news/%E2%80%98god%E2%80%99s-prophetic-movement,-message,-and-mission-and- their-attempted-neutralization-by-the-devil%E2%80%99The Latter Rain prepares the \\"last generation\\", see Ellen G. White, Early Writings, p. 85. and p. 71, Testimonies to Ministers, p. 506. Elder Ted N. C. Wilson, is a supporter of traditional Adventist beliefs such as those in the Great Controversy theme which has Last Generation Theology. He presented LGT principles in his first address to the 59th GC session in Atlanta on July 3, 2010 and in his Divine Worship message to the GYC convention on January 1, 2011. p. 85\\\\. The Latter Rain prepares the \\"last generation, Early Writings, \\"At that time the Latter Rain, or refreshing from the presence of the Lord, willcome, to give power to the loud voice of the third angel, and prepare the saints to stand in the period when the seven last plagues shall be poured out.\\" Also, \\"Early Writings, p. 71. \\"I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so needful, and were looking to the 'time of refreshing' and the latter rain to fit them to stand in the day of the Lord, and to live in His sight. 0, how many I saw in the time of trouble without a shelter! They had neglected the needful preparation; therefore they could not receive the refreshing that all must have to fit them to live in the sight of a Holy God. Those who refuse to be hewed by the prophets, and fail to purify their souls in obeying the whole truth and who are willing to believe that their condition is far better than it really is, will come up to the time of the falling of the plagues, and then see that they needed to be hewed and squared for the building. But there will be no time then to do it, and no Mediator to plead their cause before the Father.\\" and Testimonies to Ministers, p. 506. \\"The latter rain, falling near the close of the season, ripens the grain and prepares it for the sickle. The Lord employs these operations of nature to represent the work of the Holy Spirit. As the dew and the rain are given first to cause the seed to germinate, and then to ripen the harvest, so the Holy Spirit is given to carry forward from one stage to another the process of spiritual growth. The ripening of the grain represents the completion of the work of God's grace in the soul. By the power of the Holy Spirit the moral image of God is to be perfected in the character. We are to be wholly transformed into the likeness of Christ. In President Ted N.C. Wilson's sermon at the 2014 Annual Council he stated, \\"Time on this Earth is short. Probation is closing soon. Preparation to see God face to face by repentance and forsaking of sin needs to be done now. The Great Controversy, page 425, explains that: ‚ÄúThose who are living upon the Earth when the intercession of Christ shall cease in the sanctuary above, are to stand in the sight of a holy God without a mediator. Their robes must be spotless, their characters must be purified from sin by the blood of sprinkling. Through the grace of God and their own diligent effort, they must be conquerors in the battle with evil.‚Äù While Wilson does not explicitly endorse LGT, Kevin Paulson has pointed out his use of Ellen White's statement on Christ's Object Lesson, page 69, in his messages‚Äîthat the Latter Rain prepares the \\"last generation\\". This statement by Ellen White is also a key quotation used by supporters of LGT. =Recent Supporters=  Dennis Priebe  Dennis Priebe is a recent supporter of Last Generation Theology and has published Face-to-Face With the Real Gospel in 1986. Priebe, in turn, influenced Larry Kirkpatrick. Priebe also publishes articles on his website supporting Last Generation Theology.Do We Have an Adventist Gospel by Dennis PriebeGod on Trial Dennis Priebe  Larry Kirkpatrick  Larry Kirkpatrick has been publishing on the internet since 1997. In 2005, Kirkpatrick's book, Cleanse and Close: Last Generation Theology in 14 Points packaged the concepts that had been developing since the mid 19th century, and identified them as Last Generation Theology.

In relation to the larger church Last Generation Theology and its significance among Seventh- day Adventist believers is attested by the wide range of Adventist leaders and pastors,http://www.adventistreview.org/church-news/%E2%80%98the-key-of-the- gospel%E2%80%99http://www.ohioadventist.org/article/221/annual- events/2011-camp-meeting/2011-camp-meeting-bios scholarshttps://www.academia.edu/8096491/The_Sanctuary_Doctrine_--_A_Critical- Apologetic_ApproachFrancis D Nichol, Reasons for our Faith, Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald, 1947, pp.229-249.Donald K Short and Robert J Wieland, 1888 Reexamined, pp 9-10 the publishing of books like QOD and Issues which are more mainstream, the counter-publishing of the 1973 and 1974 Appeals, and the persistent historical presence of its advocates in significant church positions (M. L. Andreasen, Robert H. Pierson, C. Mervyn Maxwell, Kenneth Wood, Herbert E. Douglass, Joe Crews of Amazing Facts and Doug Batchelor, Walter Veith of Amazing Discoveries, Shawn Boonstra of Voice of Prophecy, Dennis Priebe, J. R. Zurcher, Ted Wilson, etc.) point to a train of thought within the larger church. The beliefs of a church are often defined on the basis of formally voted policy statements. However, this is but one element in the development of a meaningful understanding of the identity of a religious group. The historical-theological development of a group is also very meaningful in defining the beliefs of a Church. Last Generation Theology and the discussion surrounding it offers a window to contributory streams of thought that inform the identity of Seventh-day Adventism. Scholars such as Frank M. Hasel, insist that the remnant theology formulated in the 19th century is central to Adventist identity, and Adventists today should hold fast to it. He quotes the SDA Encyclopedia: \\"Seventh-day Adventists are convinced that ‚Äòthey alone among the bodies of Christendom are giving this message [the three angels‚Äô message of Revelation 14].‚Äô Thus,\\" says Hasel, Adventists believe \\"‚Äòthe term \\"remnant\\" to be an appropriate designation of themselves in their role as God's appointed witness to earth's last generation.‚Äô Hence, the remnant is an identifiable and visible Christian movement.\\" The Remnant in Contemporary Adventist Theology,\\" in TRR 163. For Hasel, any construal of the remnant that fails to identify it the institutional, organized Adventist church \\"weakens the nature of the end-time remnant as described in the book of Revelation.\\" The Remnant in Contemporary Adventist Theology,\\" in TRR 170. Institutions Organizations that actively promote Last Generation Theology include Larry Kirkpatrick's greatcontroversy.org and lastgenerationtheology.org. Institutions which hold to mainstream Adventist beliefs, but advocate Last Generation Theology in their programing include Generation of Youth for Christ (GYC), Iona Missions, 3ABN, Amazing Discoveries, Secrets Unsealed, White Horse Media, Amazing Facts.Dennis Priebe and Joe Crews among others at Amazing Facts have advocated LGT Robert Brinsmead Robert D. Brinsmead came from a family that were a part of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, a German splinter group that broke away from the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the World War I era over military service and conscription. They rejoined the mainstream church when he was 10. Richard Schwarz later wrote of Brinsmead and his supporters, \\"Although there had been dissident groups in the church from its start, none was more troublesome to Adventist leaders than [Brinsmead's]\\". According to Schwarz, this background gave him a disposition that was skeptical towards church leadership;Richard Schwarz, Light Bearers to the Remnant. Philip W. Dunham repeats this assertion in Blinded by the Light: The Anatomy of Apostasy with Maylan Schurch. Hagerstown, MD: Review and Herald, 2001, p38 although this assertion was removed when Floyd Greenleaf revised Schwarz' work.Schwarz and Greenleaf, Light Bearers Robert D. Brinsmead during the 1960s advocated a form of perfectionism which he described as the \\"[Sanctuary] Awakening\\" message, which was picked up and supported by some in a conservative wing known as \\"historic Adventism\\". He distorted the Adventist view of Sanctification by injecting the idea that Ellen White supported sinless perfection by self which some supporters of LGT in the \\"historic Adventists\\", are accused of presenting in their teachings or writings. He visited the United States throughout the 1960s, holding retreats and seminars to teach his message. He struck a receptive chord in \\"historic Adventists\\", as Brinsmead and his colleagues were convinced that they were recovering the original core message of the founders of 19th-century Seventh-day Adventism. During the 1970s he abandoned this position and began to emphasize the 16th-century Protestant principle of justification by faith alone but then in the 1980s began to advocate a liberal Christianity theology. He subsequently rejected many of the Adventist beliefs such as in the Sabbath and left the Adventist church and eventually rejected many orthodox Christian teachings. Most 21st- century Last Generation Theology writers and supporters are not longer aware of the links of their theology to Brinsmead and the controversies of the 1960s and 1970s. Criticism of LGT Critics of LGT bring up the following points: * The perfection theology is a message only for those who want to be highly self-disciplined in thought as well as behavior and many respond by giving up all hope and assume they will lose salvation * Perfection theology makes behavior the focus of one's Christian life. It is all about putting maximum effort into reducing one's sin, and thus is a form of salvation by works. * Perfection theology is isolating, creating separation from those who strive to keep from sinning and focused on the goal of perfect living which tends to isolate oneself from the outside world and those in the church who do not treat perfection with the same importance. * Perfection theology suggests that we must live a life that tends to focus on legalism. * Perfection theology suggests that it is possible to live life without sin. Adventist theologian Richard Rice writes that who teach \\"sinless perfection\\" tend to misunderstand and think of perfection as primarily negative, as avoiding certain forms of behavior, or successfully resisting temptations to do wrong. While perfection certainly involves the absence of sinful behavior, it is not just as a negative but it has a positive side as well which consists in the presence of certain attitudes and actions. The example given in the life of Christ Himself, the ultimate manifestation of a holy character.https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1984/06/sanctification-and- perfection:-another-look Adventist historian George R. Knight wrote in \\"A Search for Identity: The Development of Seventh-Day Adventist Beliefs\\" the following on M. L. Andreasen views. First: He emphasized a parallel cleansing of the sanctuary on the anti-typical Day of Atonement, God's people on earth must cleanse their soul temple while Christ is cleansing the sanctuary in heaven. Second: He held to the understanding that Revelation 15:8 teaches that the final generation will go through the time of trouble without a Mediator. Third: Ellen White's statement that \\"Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to claim them as His own.\\"White, Christ's Object Lessons, p. 69 Fourth: He held that Jesus became incarnate in flesh just like Adam after the Fall. Fifth: That God's end-time people would demonstrate to the universe a people whose lives would proclaim: '\\"Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.'\\" Sixth: Andreasen firmly believed that Christ's atonement remained unfinished at the cross.Knight wrote that according to Andreasen the atonement had three phases.Knight finds that Andreasen said, \\"Christ demonstrates that man can do what He did, with the same help He had. This phase includes His session at the right hand of God, His high priestly ministry, and the final exhibition of His saints in their last struggle with Satan, and their glorious victory ... The third phase is now in progress in the sanctuary above and in the church below\\" as Christ is \\"eliminating and destroying sin in his saints on earth.\\"Andreasen, Book of Hebrews, pages 59, 60 =Nature of Christ= According to Adventist historian George Knight, Ellen White's view of the sinful nature of Christ was not the same one held by Andreasen. She, for example, explicitly said that Jesus as a child, had an inclination to right rather than having sinful tendencies. In Knights opinion, Jesus was not just like other children of fallen Adam. =Perceived Weaknesses of Andreasen's Last Generation Theology= George Knight suggests while it has strong points that are in keeping with mainline SDA theology such as its concern with sanctification, its insight that God's justification in the eyes of the universe is more important than the justification of individuals, has serious weaknesses. George Knight writes that Andreasen regarded sin as a series of actions. Andreasen's behavior-by-behavior approach to sin led him into the problem of a behavior-by-behavior approach to sanctification and perfection. Such a theory runs into problems from the perspective of both the New Testament and Ellen White's theology. = Questions on Doctrine= Knight writes that two points in Questions on Doctrine were seen by Andreasen to represent a perceived change from the position of the Adventist Church in the first half of the century. # A completed atoning sacrifice on the cross (an issue in theology that seemed to Andreasen to contradict a major point in Adventist belief regarding atonement since 1845, that the atonement that began at the cross is continued in heaven in October 1844) and # Christ was born with a sinless human nature. Knight felt these two concepts undermined Andreasen's final generation theology.Questions on Doctrine stated that Jesus had \\"provided\\" the complete sacrificial atonement on the cross while not yielding the Adventist understanding that the atonement continued in the heavenly sanctuary where Christ \\"applied\\" the benefits of His sacrificial atonement. To Andreasen the writers of that book \\"could not teach that the atonement on the cross was final, complete and all sufficient, and yet believe that another atonement, also final, occurred in 1844. Such would be absurd and meaningless\\". Edward Heppenstall emphasized the atonement on the cross with a continuing ministry in heaven in the antitypical Day of Atonement. Beyond that, he stressed what became teachings such as the helplessness of human beings to do good on their own accord, justification by faith in relation to the entire plan of salvation, the impossibility of humanly achieving overcoming sin or what some people think of as sinless perfection. Heppenstall's understanding of character perfection was far from ideas of sinlessness, perfectionism, the teaching that people must get to the place where they are sanctified at the end. Heppenstall argued that \\"nowhere does the Bible equate perfection with sinlessness when speaking of the child of God\\" and that \\"salvation by grace means being shaken loose from the folly of implanting our ego at the center [of the plan of salvation] with the belief that we must arrive at sinless perfection to be sure of salvation\\". Heppenstall in Knights view demonstrated that it is essentially spiritual maturity and walking with God in love. In Knights view one who is in Christ must of necessity be both justified (declared righteous) and sanctified (set apart for holy use), that at the same time that individuals are justified they are also born again and transformed. =Appeal to the writings of Ellen White= George Knight wrote that, a third important issue Andreasen raised in relation to his argument against the \\"new\\" view of the nature of Christ is that Andreasen viewed the statements on the nature of Christ in Questions on Doctrine as being opposed to what he thought was taught in Ellen White's writings. This results in his claim that a person would either have to accept Questions on Doctrine or Ellen White. Andreasen's theology of perfectionism is inherent in his final generation theology and laypeople and a significant portion of the clergy continued to hold it. Some Adventists who hold to this tend to think of themselves as the believers in \\"historic Adventism.\\" See also * Christian perfection * Seventh-day Adventist Church * Seventh-day Adventist theology * Historic Adventist References * The Final Generation, by M.

Newspapers usually have specific policies for readers to report factual errors. Generally, this involves the reader contacting an editor, pointing out the mistake and providing the correct information. Sometimes, an editor or affected reporter will be asked to refer to a note or press release to determine how the mistake was made. In print newspapers, a correction notice will often appear in its own column in a subsequent issue. In online news media, a \\"trashline\\" or \\"advisory line\\" may be added to the top of a corrected article. According to the Reuters Handbook of Journalism, \\"the trashline should say exactly why a story is being withdrawn, corrected, refiled or repeated. All trashlines on refiles and corrections must include the word 'corrects' or 'correcting'.\\" A correction differs from a clarification, which clears up a statement that ‚Äì while factually correct ‚Äì may result in a misunderstanding or an unfair assumption. Corrections can be the result of reporting errors or typographical mistakes, or may happen because the newspaper was provided incorrect information. Examples Most newspaper errors are relatively minor, sometimes mere typos or atomic typos, and involve one of the following: * Names ‚Äì Their name was misspelled, someone was misidentified (e.g., in a photograph), their professional title was incorrect ... the list goes on. * Figures ‚Äì Usually, the result of a typographical error, although it can adversely affect a story (e.g., \\"the lawsuit was for $8 million, not $8 billion\\"). * Time/date/place ‚Äì Usually, as for an event (e.g., \\"the event will be on Friday, not Saturday\\"). However, some corrections are the result of major mistakes or carelessness in reporting, and in extreme examples involve such things as completely incorrect facts, gross misquotes and extreme misrepresentations. Following are some examples: From The Guardian, 2004: From the New York Daily News, 2009: From The New York Times, 2010: In 2003, The New York Times published an article containing factual errors and misquotes contained in articles written by Jayson Blair, the reporter who became the central figure in the newspaper's plagiarism scandal earlier in the year.

The character made his first appearance during the fourth series episode \\"Chain Reaction\\", which was broadcast on 8 September 1989. Josh was a paramedic, who worked for the fictitious Holby Ambulance Service. Josh became one of the longest serving characters during his time in the show. Bleasdale decided to leave the show in 2007 and Josh departed in the twenty-second series episode \\"Finding the Words\\", first broadcast on 3 November 2007. Bleasdale reprised the role for the show's 30th anniversary feature-length episode in August 2016. He then made two guest appearances in February and June 2017, before returning for the thirty-second series in late 2017. Creation and casting The character was based on real life paramedic Clive Haddrell, who advised the script writers on the accuracy of the paramedics featured in the show. Actor Ian Bleasdale was initially contracted for a small number of episodes as a guest paramedic. He made his debut as Josh during the fourth series on 8 September 1989. Bleasdale was asked to return for more episodes during the following series, and then for 14 episodes of the sixth series in 1991, before continuing in the role. Development =Departure= After appearing in the show for eighteen years and becoming one of the longest serving actors, Bleasdale announced his departure in August 2007. He chose to leave Casualty in order to pursue new acting roles and spend more time with his family. Bleasdale had decided to quit the show two years prior, but stayed for his character's storylines. He filmed his final scenes in July. Series producer Oliver Kent stated that the character's exit would allow him to make a return in the future. Bleasdale wanted Josh to have a happy ending, following a series of bad events in his life. He did not want to act out a death scene. Bleasdale said Josh would find \\"true happiness\\" towards the end of his time in the show. Josh met and fell in love with a woman while he was on holiday. He then decided to leave Holby to be with her and shared a \\"touching farewell\\" with his friend Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson). Josh departed during the episode broadcast on 3 November 2007. =Returns= On 5 August 2016, it was confirmed that Bleasdale had reprised his role for Casualty's 30th anniversary feature-length episode. Of his return, the actor commented, \\"My first feeling was of slight apprehension, and the first scene of the first day I had to deal with a technically complex script! The medical advisor, Pete Salt, looked at me and said 'Ian, you know what to do' and I did! Great cast and crew, fantastic director and producer. I felt completely at home again and loved it.\\" Josh returns to Holby to celebrate his friend Charlie's thirty years of service to the NHS. However, he ends up helping out in the ED. The episode aired on 27 August 2016. Bleasdale reprised the role again in 2017 for a storyline focusing on the wedding of Charlie and Duffy. He made a further appearance in June 2017. Months later, Bleasdale reprised the role for the thirty-second series. His return scenes were teased in the show's Autumn trailer, which caused Elaine Reilly of What's on TV to observe \\"Josh (Ian Bleasdale) has been no stranger to popping up in Holby as a paramedic manager recently. But to see him feature so prominently in the autumn trailer makes us wonder, is he returning more permanently?\\" Storylines Josh is a paramedic, who in 18 years saved countless lives, risked his own life on many occasions and endured endless personal trauma. Josh's deepest personal trauma was when a fire ripped through his house in January 1997. His daughter was the only person rescued from the wreckage; his wife Helen and son Ashley (a Cystic fibrosis sufferer) died at the scene, whilst his daughter Sarah later died in hospital afterwards despite frantic attempts of the hospital staff to save her life. Josh returned to work within two weeks of the tragedy, but later developed a gambling and drinking addiction which took two years to overcome. Josh has since struggled to find love. He married Collette but his marriage collapsed after discovering she was pregnant with a child that had been conceived during an illicit affair. His most recent date proved a disaster as he prepared a meal of duck for a vegetarian and had his overflowing bath fall through the ceiling and collapse on him. Josh commands a lot of respect from the forever-changing staff of Holby City hospital. The paramedic he had the closest friendship with was Finlay \\"Fin\\" Newton (who was murdered). Their friendly banter proved so popular they were granted their own special episode which focused on their shift. Josh nearly died in a landslide in season 15. Prior to this he has been stabbed and strangled, shot at, taken hostage and trapped in quicksand. He has also received a long-service medal from the Queen. At the end of \\"Killing Me Softly,\\" (episode 15 from Season 21) Josh was stabbed in the left hand side of his neck in the back of an ambulance. He was still bleeding and his attacker closed the door on him when the episode ended. The attacker was a woman named Laura Merriman who appeared to be having a mental breakdown and seemed to believe that her child was sick. Josh was tending to a man who had just jumped out of a window on one of the upper floors of the ED when he saw Laura walking away with an unconscious Rosie in a wheelchair. Laura sought shelter in an unlocked ambulance but when Josh entered she thought that he was trying to take her daughter, Rosie, away from her, so she stabbed him. The ending was a cliffhanger with Josh bleeding heavily. However, in the next part of the story, a badly bleeding Josh was found in the ambulance by Nathan. He shouted for help and Charlie and the rest of the team came out, rushing him straight into resus. Laura is then caught and arrested and Rosie is saved. The week after, Josh was seen recovering in another ward of the hospital. Due to recent events, he had become depressed and couldn't see a future for himself. After a heart-to-heart with his longest and best friend Charlie, Josh realised there was so much he wanted to see in the world. After saying his goodbyes to Charlie, Josh left the series at the end of 2006 and set off on his travels to see cricket and culture around the world. Josh returned in the episode \\"Aliens\\", when on a flight returning from Pakistan, a man jumped out of the stationary plane, injuring himself and then jumped in causing a terrorist alert. On his return Josh, decided to step down as Duty Officer, giving the job to Dixie. His Indian visitors Devika and Sajini (who was in need of an operation, which Josh paid for) came to visit. When Josh realised his true feelings for Devika, he proposed saying it was for her visa. She refused, thinking that the proposal would be because Josh loved her. Josh caught up with Devika and Sajani at the airport and they left together. Josh returned for Charlie's 30th anniversary celebrations at the hospital in August 2016. He assisted when an emergency helicopter crashed outside the Emergency Department, and teamed up with both Charlie and Duffy keep the situation under control and to save lives. A few months later Josh returned for Charlie's stag night and subsequent wedding to Duffy. Reception Josh was named one of the ten best Casualty characters by a reporter for The Daily Telegraph. They stated, \\"Everyone needs a Josh in their life. But the beloved paramedic, played by Ian Bleasdale from 1989 until 2007, had terrible luck.\\" Critic Jim Shelley branded Josh the \\"world's oldest and unluckiest ambulance man\\".

Sima Bao's father Sima Mo (Âè∏È¶¨Ê®°) the Prince of Nanyang was a younger brother of Sima Yue the Prince of Donghai, who was regent for Emperor Hui and Emperor Huai. Both Sima Mo and Sima Yue were sons of Sima Tai (Âè∏È¶¨Ê≥∞) the Prince of Gaomi, the son of Sima Yi's brother Sima Kui (Âè∏È¶¨È¶ó). Late in 313, after Emperor Huai was captured by Han Zhao after the fall of the capital Luoyang, Sima Mo, who was defending Chang'an, was captured by the Han Zhao general Zhao Ran (Ë∂ôÊüì) and executed. At the time of his father's death, Sima Bao was at Shanggui (‰∏äÈÇΩ, in modern Tianshui, Gansu). He took the title of the Prince of Nanyang, and soon became in control of Qin Province (Áß¶Â∑û, modern eastern Gansu). He was known for his generosity and openness, and the people of the province, whether Han, Di, or Qiang, were said to be open to his leadership. He was also grossly overweight‚Äîaccording to historians, at 800 Chinese pounds (jin, Êñ§) -- or roughly 400 kilograms (880 pounds) and said to be impotent, and therefore had no children. He entered into an alliance with Zhang Gui (ÂºµËªå), the governor of Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û, modern central and western Gansu), and Zhang's domain, largely untouched by wars, often supplied Sima Bao's. After Emperor Min assumed the throne in 313, Sima Bao, whose troops were still sizable, was given the title of right prime minister (Âè≥‰∏ûÁõ∏), but while he took occasional campaigns to relieve Emperor Min's government, then at Chang'an, from pressures being applied by Han Zhao forces, he took no actual actions to put Emperor Min under his protection. Indeed, in 316, when his generals briefly defeated Han Zhao forces seeking to siege Chang'an, they stopped short of reaching Chang'an, which was then captured by Han Zhao forces, causing Emperor Min to be captured. Sima Bao then considered taking the emperor title for himself. In 319, he took a title one stop from that‚Äîby declaring himself the Prince of Jin, the same title that the founding emperor Emperor Wu's father Sima Zhao took during his stint as Cao Wei's regent. He believed that Zhang Gui's son and successor Zhang Shi (ÂºµÂØî) would support him, but Zhang decided not to commit, believing that Sima Rui the Prince of Langye, who had claimed the imperial title in 318 after Emperor Min was executed by Han Zhao, might be the more appropriate emperor. In early 320, when the Han Zhao emperor Liu Yao decided to undertake a major campaign to wipe out Sima Bao, Sima Bao's domain happened to be suffering under a famine, and he fled to Sangcheng (Ê°ëÂüé, in modern Dingxi, Gansu), ready to flee to Zhang's domain. Zhang sent a force that ostensibly was to protect Sima Bao, but instead was intended to stop him from arriving in Zhang's domain. Later that year, Sima Bao's generals Zhang Chun (ÂºµÊò•) and Yang Ci (Ê•äÊ¨°) tried to persuade him to execute another general of his, Yang Tao (Ê•äÈüú) and also to attack a former subordinate, Chen An (Èô≥ÂÆâ), who had surrendered to Han Zhao, but who had continued to covertly supply Sima Bao. Sima Bao did not agree with them. Soon, he died‚Äîwith some historians believing that he was murdered by Zhang and Yang Ci, while some historians believed he died of natural causes. Zhang and Yang Ci, because Sima Bao was sonless, supported a son of the Sima clan, Sima Zhan (Âè∏È¶¨Áûª) to be Sima Bao's heir. Chen, still bearing some loyalty to Sima Bao and believing that he had been murdered, attacked and killed Sima Zhan. Zhang fled, but Yang Ci was captured, and Chen executed him before Sima Bao's casket, and then buried Sima Bao with honors due an emperor and gave him the posthumous name of Prince Yuan.

A Democratic U.S. Representative from Virginia, he was a leader of the informal but powerful anti-civil rights coalition. Early life and education Howard Worth Smith was born in Broad Run, Virginia, on February 2, 1883. He attended public schools and graduated from Bethel Military Academy in Warrenton, Virginia during 1901. He took his LLB at the law department of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville in 1903. Smith was admitted to the bar in 1904 and practiced in Alexandria, Virginia. During World War I, he was assistant general counsel to the Federal Alien Property Custodian. From 1918 to 1922 he was Commonwealth's Attorney of Alexandria. He served as a judge from 1922 until 1930 (he was often referred to as \\"Judge Smith\\" even while in Congress), and also engaged in banking, farming, and dairying. Representative He was elected in 1930 to the U.S. House of Representatives. He initially supported New Deal measures such as the Tennessee Valley Authority Act and the National Industrial Recovery Act. A leader of the conservative coalition, he led the opposition to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), established by the Wagner Act of 1935. Conservatives created a special House committee to investigate the NLRB that was headed by Smith and dominated by opponents of the New Deal. The committee conducted a sensationalist investigation that undermined public support for the NLRB and, more broadly, for the New Deal. In June 1940, amendments proposed by the Smith Committee passed by a large margin in the House, partly because Smith's new alliance with William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor. The AFL was convinced the NLRB was controlled by leftists who supported the rival Congress of Industrial Organizations in organizing drives. New Dealers stopped the Smith amendments, but Roosevelt replaced the CIO-oriented members on the NLRB with men acceptable to Smith and the AFL.Storrs, p. 212. Smith proposed the Alien Registration Act of 1940, an anticommunist law, which became known as the Smith Act. It required resident aliens to register. It also banned advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government or its political subdivisions. American Communist Party chairman Gus Hall was one of many communists later convicted of violating its provisions. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Yates v. United States (1957) that the First Amendment protected much radical speech, which halted prosecutions under the Smith Act. =Opposition to civil rights= As chairman of the United States House Committee on Rules starting in 1954, Smith controlled the flow of legislation in the House. An opponent of racial integration, Smith used his power as chairman of the Rules Committee to keep much civil rights legislation from coming to a vote on the House floor. He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). A friend described him as someone who \\"had a real feeling of kindness toward the black people he knew, but he did not respect the race.\\" When the Civil Rights Act of 1957 came before Smith's committee, Smith said, \\"The Southern people have never accepted the colored race as a race of people who had equal intelligence and education and social attainments as the whole people of the South.\\" Others noted him as an apologist for slavery who used the Ancient Greeks and Romans in its defense. Speaker Sam Rayburn tried to reduce his power in 1961, with only limited success. Smith delayed passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. One of Rayburn's reforms was the \\"Twenty-One Day Rule\\" that required a bill to be sent to the floor within 21 days. Under pressure, Smith released the bill. Two days before the vote, Smith offered an amendment to insert \\"sex\\" after the word \\"religion\\" as a protected class of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Congressional Record shows Smith made serious arguments, voicing concerns that white women would suffer greater discrimination without a protection for gender. Liberals, who knew Smith was hostile to civil rights for blacks, assumed that he was doing so to defeat the whole bill.Clinton Jacob Woods, \\"Strange Bedfellows: Congressman Howard W. Smith and the Inclusion of Sex Discrimination in the 1964 Civil Rights Act,\\" Southern Studies, 16 (Spring‚ÄìSummer 2009), 1‚Äì32. In 1968, Leo Kanowitz wrote that, within the context of the anti-civil rights coalition making \\"every effort to block\\" the passage of Title VII, \\"it is abundantly clear that a principal motive in introducing [\\"sex\\"] was to prevent passage of the basic legislation being considered by Congress, rather than solicitude for women's employment rights.\\"Leo Kanowitz, Sex-Based Discrimination in American Law III: Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 20 Hastings L. Rev. 305 (1968). Kanowitz notes that Representative Edith Green, who was one of the few female legislators in the House at that time, held that view that legislation against sex discrimination in employment \\"would not have received one hundred votes,\\" indicating that it would have been defeated handedly. House Rules Committee clerk's record of markup session adding \\"sex\\" to bill. In 1964, the burning national issue was civil rights for blacks. Liberals argued that it was \\"the Negro's hour\\" and that adding women's rights to the bill could hurt its chance of being passed. However, conservatives on race voted for the Smith amendment. The National Woman's Party (NWP) had used Smith to include sex as a protected category and so achieved their main goal. The prohibition of sex discrimination was added on the floor by Smith. While Smith was a conservative who strongly opposed civil rights laws for blacks, he supported such laws for women. Smith's amendment passed by a vote of 168 to 133. online version. Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1940, would probably vote for the amendment. Some historians speculate that Smith, in addition to helping women, was trying to embarrass Northern Democrats, who opposed civil rights for women since labor unions opposed the clause. from Duquesne Law Review. Smith insisted that he sincerely supported the amendment and along with Representative Martha Griffiths was the chief spokesperson for the amendment. For 20 years, Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment, with no linkage to racial issues, in the House. He for decades had been close to the NWP and its leader, Alice Paul, one of the leaders in winning the vote for women in 1920 and the chief supporter of equal rights proposals since then. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 to try to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category.Rosenberg (2008). p.187; notes that Smith had been working for years with two Virginia feminists on the issue. Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women and so was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws \\"protecting\\" women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, which was unfair to women who were not allowed to try the jobs.Harrison 1989. p.179 The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. Republicans and Northern Democrats voted for the bill's final passage. When Bostock v. Clayton County was decided in 2020, legal scholars postulated that Smith's insertion of \\"sex\\" into Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964 had inadvertently protected sexual orientation and gender identity from employment discrimination. Smith had a part in temporarily blocking the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 because \\"Job Corps provision would allow coeducational and interracial job camps.\\" =Defeat= After U.S. Senator Carter Glass died in 1946, Smith sought the nomination to succeed him. The Byrd Organization, of which Smith was a member, instead nominated A. Willis Robertson, who was elected to the Senate. Smith was defeated in the 1966 primary by a considerably more liberal Democrat, State Delegate George Rawlings. Although Smith remained neutral in the general election, many of his supporters defected to Republican William L. Scott, who soundly defeated Rawlings in November. Later life Smith resumed the practice of law in Alexandria, where he died at 93 on October 3, 1976. He was interred in Georgetown Cemetery, Broad Run, Virginia. Portrait controversy In January 1995, the House Rules Committee chairman, Republican Congressman Gerald B. H. Solomon, had a portrait of Smith hung in the Committee hearing room.

The cartoon follows Donald Duck as he tours the fictional Museum of Modern Marvels. It was directed by Jack King, his first project at the Disney studio, and features original music by Oliver Wallace. The voice cast includes Clarence Nash as Donald, Billy Bletcher as the Robot Butler, Adriana Caselotti as the Robot Baby Carriage and Cliff Edwards (in one of his first Disney roles) as the Robot Barber. Modern Inventions pokes fun at modern conveniences. The scene of Donald in the barber's chair was submitted by Carl Barks as his first story contribution at Disney.Trivia from Modern Inventions at the Internet Movie Database. It is also the final Disney short to be released by United Artists.  Plot  Donald visits the \\"Museum of Modern Marvels\\" which showcases various futuristic electronic appliances and inventions. He uses a quarter on a line to get in (this allows him to keep his money and get in as well). Once inside, he is confronted with the \\"Robot Butler\\", a robotic golden cyclops who takes hats (\\"Your hat, sir.\\") After Donald's hat is taken away from him, Donald uses a magic trick to produce another hat (similar to the way he produces flutes in The Band Concert). He says, \\"So!\\" and continues on his way. He first encounters a robotic hitch-hiker, which activates when he makes driving noises. However, when he laughs at it, it punches him in the face. Next he goes to the wrapping machine, which says \\"Do not touch\\" but Donald ignores the sign and hops on. When he pulls a lever, the machine proceeds to grab him in two robotic arms, put transparent wrapping paper around him, and put him in ribbons, like a package. He manages to break out by vigorously shaking, and continues exploring. All the time, Donald has been losing hat after hat to the Robot Butler, making Donald angrier and angrier. Eventually, the Butler chases him through the museum to an automated baby carriage, which Donald hides inside. Donald is given a baby's hat to wear as is rocked as the song \\"Rock-a- bye Baby\\" is played. Donald then begins acting like a baby, sucking his feet, playing with toys offered to him and getting ticked under the chin, and having his feet counted \\"This Little Piggy went to market.\\" Donald then begins whining about not getting his milk. The machine gets out a bottle of milk but it hits him in the face instead of going into his mouth, making Donald agitated. The machine begins torturing him with toys and more milk in the face, turning him over and pinning a diaper on his bottom and powdering it. The Robot Butler is again attracted by Donald's laughing and yanks the baby hat off his head. Donald produces one last hat and goes to the one exhibit he's not yet seen: a self-operating hair makeup chair. Using his \\"cheat\\" coin, Donald pays to get his hair done. However, instead of giving him a haircut, it flips him over, removes his hat, and given his bottom a cut, wrapping his rear end in a towel, cutting off his tail feathers, cleaning his bill, coating his face with shoe polish, sifting through his bottom feathers, applying a wet towel to it, slapping his blackened face with a cloth, combing his bottom with a comb, making a gap through it, smoothing it out and finally, giving him a pig tail design. The Robot Butler appears and removes Donald's last hat, which causes Donald to enter an explosive rage.

Park lands entirely surround Rice Lake, an important stopping point for migrating waterfowl. The lake covers with an average depth of . Natural history The park's bedrock is limestone laid down 500 million years ago as organic sediments settled to the bottom of a shallow sea that covered much of the Midwest. This limestone is entirely covered by glacial till deposited during a Pre-Illinoian glaciation about 400,000 years ago. As those glaciers were retreating, a block of ice broke off and remained embedded in the till. The ice melted, forming a kettle which became Rice Lake. 10,000 years ago the more recent Wisconsin glaciation missed Rice Lake, passing to the west of the park. Meltwater from that glacier eroded streambeds into the Kansan till. Rice Lake is the headwaters of the South Branch, Middle Fork of the Zumbro River. This east flowing stream was the lake's original outlet. After the Wisconsin glacier passed, the land to the west was lowered and a second outlet formed that flowed west into another watershed. This outlet feeds the Straight River, a tributary of the Cannon River. In historical times, Rice Lake may have been as much as deep, but has filled in considerably due to human influence and the process of eutrophication. Today, Rice Lake is ringed with marsh vegetation. The marshy, shallow nature of the lake, as well as its being the only large lake in the area, make it ideal for migrating waterfowl. Whistling swans, Canada and snow geese, diving ducks, western and pied-billed grebes, and black terns are frequent visitors. The park lands are covered in a hardwood forest of maple, basswood, elm, and oak, with some meadow openings. However this is not representative of the area's pre-settlement vegetation, which would have been oak savanna with somewhat denser tree growth on the east side of the lake. The water buffered the eastern shore against wildfires burning in from the prairie to the southwest. Cultural history Rice Lake Church, built in 1857 Wild rice grows naturally in the lake, hence its English name. Native Americans in the area harvested the rice as an important food source. The Treaty of Mendota in 1851 opened up southern Minnesota to European settlement. In 1854, the village of Rice Lake arose on the northeast shore of the lake, along an important stagecoach route. The village was expected to grow significantly for a rail line was planned to pass through, but the line was ultimately laid farther south and Rice Lake was soon abandoned. The one surviving structure from the village of Rice Lake is a Methodist church built in 1857, which still stands in the northeast corner of the state park. Rice Lake's other outlets were dammed and diked in the 1870s to channel more flow down the eastern outlet to power a mill in Wasioja. Nevertheless, the water level would periodically drop too low to run the mill, and it went out of business, later burning down in 1891. Most of the water control structures remained in place, however, limiting outflow and resulting in eutrophication from accumulated agricultural runoff. Rice Lake grew progressively shallower as it filled in with dead vegetation. In the 20th century, Rice Lake became a recreational destination in the area, for although it was filling in, it was one of the few lakes in southeast Minnesota. The Izaak Walton League owned on the north shore, and another fishing and hunting club owned other lakefront. In 1961, the newspaper editor in Claremont, Dana Hinckley, sparked strong local interest in creating a state park around Rice Lake. The idea was appealing for several factors. Owatonna had lost part of Kaplan Woods State Park to construction of Interstate 35, and the Owatonna swimming pool was crowded. Residents expected that the state would dredge Rice Lake to improve boating and swimming. With such support, legislation creating Rice Lake State Park passed in 1963. That same year the shrunken Kaplan Woods State Park was transferred to Owatonna as a city park, known today as Kaplan's Woods Parkway. The actual purchase of lots from their various private owners proceeded more slowly than local enthusiasm would have indicated. Several owners were reluctant to sell, but by 1967 recreational facilities had been installed in the north central part of the park, mostly on the former Izaak Walton League property. Inholdings have been acquired periodically over the years, but the dream of dredging Rice Lake proved unfeasible. Moreover, the mud, algae, and leeches compromised the lake‚Äôs appeal as a swimming destination. However, as Rice Lake has become less appealing for human activities, it has become more appealing to waterfowl. Rice Lake State Park has reinvented itself as a birdwatching destination.

His idea with the Videoplace was the creation of an artificial reality that surrounded the users, and responded to their movements and actions, without being encumbered by the use of goggles or gloves. The work done in the lab would form the basis of his much cited 1983 book Artificial Reality. The Videoplace (or VIDEOPLACE as Krueger would have it), was the culmination of several iterations of artificial reality systems: GLOWFLOW, METAPLAY, and PSYCHIC SPACE; each offering improvements over the previous installation until VIDEOPLACE was a full blown artificial reality lab at the University of Connecticut. The Videoplace used projectors, video cameras, special purpose hardware, and onscreen silhouettes of the users to place the users within an interactive environment. Users in separate rooms in the lab were able to interact with one another through this technology. The movements of the users recorded on video were analyzed and transferred to the silhouette representations of the users in the Artificial Reality environment. By the users being able to visually see the results of their actions on screen, through the use of the crude but effective colored silhouettes, the users had a sense of presence while interacting with onscreen objects and other users even though there was no direct tactile feedback available. The sense of presence was enough that users pulled away when their silhouettes intersected with those of other users. (Kalawsky 1993; Rheingold 1992).

It is most commonly associated with: * posterior vitreous detachment * migraine aura (ocular migraine / retinal migraine) * migraine aura without headache * scintillating scotoma * retinal break or detachment * occipital lobe infarction (similar to occipital stroke) * sensory deprivation (ophthalmopathic hallucinations) * age-related macular degeneration * vertebrobasilar insufficiency * optic neuritis Vitreous shrinkage or liquefaction, which are the most common causes of photopsia, cause a pull in vitreoretinal attachments, irritating the retina and causing it to discharge electrical impulses. These impulses are interpreted by the brain as flashes. This condition has also been identified as a common initial symptom of punctate inner choroiditis (PIC), a rare retinal autoimmune disease believed to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking and destroying the retina. During pregnancy, new-onset photopsia is concerning for severe preeclampsia. Photopsia can present as retinal detachment when examined by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. However, it can also be a sign of uveal melanoma. This condition is extremely rare (5‚Äì7 per 1 million people will be affected, typically fair-skinned, blue-eyed northern Europeans). Photopsia should be investigated immediately.  Causes  Several conditions affecting the eyes can cause photopsia to occur. The underlying condition must be identified and treated to resolve the symptoms. = Peripheral (posterior) vitreous detachment = Peripheral (posterior) vitreous detachment occurs when the gel around the eye separates from the retina. This can naturally occur with age. However, if it occurs too rapidly, it can cause photopsia which manifests in flashes and floaters in the vision. Typically, the flashes and floaters go away in a few months. = Retinal detachment = The retina lines the inside of the eye. It is light-sensitive and communicates visual messages to the brain. If the retina detaches, it moves and shifts from its normal position. This can cause photopsia, but can also cause permanent vision loss. Medical attention is needed to prevent vision loss. Procedures may include laser treatment, freezing, or surgery. = Age-related macular degeneration = Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition among people aged 50 and older. The macula is a part of the eye that helps you see sharply straight ahead. With AMD, the macula slowly deteriorates which can cause photopsia. = Ocular (retinal) migraine / Migraine aura = Migraines are a type of recurring headache. Migraines typically cause severe pain in the head, but can also cause visual changes known as auras. Migraines can also cause visual snow. = Optic neuritis = Optic neuritis is an inflammation that damages the optic nerve. It‚Äôs linked to multiple sclerosis (MS). Along with flickering or flashing with eye movement, symptoms include pain, loss of colour perception, and vision loss. = Occipital lobe infarction (stroke) or ischemia = The occipital lobe is one of four lobes in the brain. It controls the ability to see things. Impaired blood flow to the cells of the occipital lobe (ischemia, for example as caused by a TIA or Vertebrobasilar insufficiency) will lead to temporary visual problems; if the poor blood flow is sustained it will lead to cell death (infarction, for example as caused by a stroke) which may cause persistent visual problems. The main symptoms associated with an occipital lobe infarction involve changes to vision such as: * blurry vision * blindness, which may affect part of vision only * hallucinations, such as flashing lights (photopsia): usually only in the context of blindness = Sensory deprivation (Ophthalmopathic hallucinations) = Sensory deprivation or ophthalmopathic hallucination are hallucinations that appear in the field of vision.  Appearance  Photopsias is defined as an effect on the vision that causes appearances of anomalies in the vision. Photopsias usually appear as: * flickering lights * shimmering lights * floating shapes * moving dots *snow or static Photopsias are not generally a condition on their own, but a symptom of another condition.

It was the third film in the Donald Duck series of short films, although billed at the time as a Mickey Mouse cartoon. It was the first of the series to be released by RKO.Donald's Ostrich at the Internet Movie Database Donald's Ostrich was directed by Jack King and features the voices of Clarence Nash as Donald Duck, Pinto Colvig as Hortense the Ostrich (hiccups), and Elvia Allman and Billy Bletcher as radio voices. Plot Donald is working along as a custodian at a whistle stop train station and is responsible for loading and unloading luggage. A train passes the station and dumps a large pile of luggage on Donald without stopping. Donald finds that one of the crates contains an ostrich and tied around the ostrich's neck he finds the following note: \\"My name is HORTENSE. Please see that I am fed and watered. P.S. I eat !\\" Hortense begins to eat anything she can find at the station starting with the message. This includes Donald Duck's bottom. She then eats a concertina, a wind-up alarm clock and several balloons. This causes Hortense to have hiccups which Donald tries to cure by scaring her. Finally Hortense swallows Donald's radio and her body begins to react to what is playing on the radio. Donald realizes Hortense has swallowed the radio and grabs a pair of forceps to try to pull it out (but ends up getting the concertina out instead). But when Hortense starts to react to a broadcast car race, Donald is unable to control her. Hortense finally crashes through a door which at last knocks the radio out of her, but she also gives Donald the hiccups. Hortense While Donald's Ostrich was the first and only time that Hortense the Ostrich appeared in animation, she later appeared as a comic book character as Donald's pet. Her first comic appearance was in the first publication of the Donald Duck Annual in 1938. Hortense also appeared in the Donald Duck comic strip, first appearing in October 3, 1938 for a few weeks, and then appearing very occasionally until her last appearance on October 30, 1944. Deleted scenes One of the scenes involves Donald dressing up as Frankenstein's monster and scaring Hortense. The reason for cutting this out of the official version might have been that the design of the monster was copyrighted by Universal. These scenes were not included for theatrical release in the United States. However, they are left intact on a Pathescope 9.5mm home movie release of the film in the United Kingdom, dated from February 1938.

The mall was developed by The Rouse Company.http://www.labelscar.com/florida/tampa-bay-center When it opened on August 5, 1976 the Tampa Bay Center was Tampa's fourth major mall and operated until 2001, when most of its tenants relocated to the nearby International Plaza. The mall was a two-story building that had an anchor at each end, plus one in the center of the mall: Burdines on the east side, Montgomery Ward in the center, and Sears on the west side. Appearance Tampa Bay Center's main corridor was splashed in sunlight, a large portion of the roof was actually constructed with skylights; a bright and sunny day outdoors meant a bright and sunny day indoors considered to be an inviting feature at a time when many malls were being built with dropped ceilings and finished with darker colors. The mall featured exposed, light-colored truss ceilings over the main corridor, tan-brown floor tiles, floor-based water fountains, and trees intermittently planted on the bottom floor of the main corridor, growing upwards toward the skylights. The open-and-airy interior was further augmented by what was thought to be one of the mall's most important trademarks, a glass elevator located in the center of the mall. The North Side parking lot had an unusual-for-flat-central-Florida slope to it that meant that the mall entrance on that side of the building was on the second floor, leading directly into the food court, which opened in 1987.Tampabay: Glazer paid $22.8-million for mall In the 1990s, the mall's center court featured a 1922 Herschell-Spillman carousel with carved wooden horses, with the oldest horse carved in 1880. Discovered in a West Tampa warehouse by Lynne Beckett and Tommy Sciortino, the couple invested $100,000 into its restoration. The carousel's Wurlitzer band organ was replaced with taped music, and its canvas top was removed so shoppers upstairs could see in. Cinema The mall featured a cinema with two screens from the beginning until it closed on February 28, 1990. The final movies shown were Roger & Me and Stella. Montgomery Ward Due to the success of the mall, a third anchor, Montgomery Ward was proposed in November 1977. It opened by 1979 on the south side of the mall. Decline and closure In 1994 the mall's management was accused of racism for closing early during the Florida Classic college football game between FAMU and Bethune Cookman, both historically black universities. Then Montgomery Ward was closed in 1999, and the Burdines followed soon afterwards, moving to the new Citrus Park Town Center mall northwest of Tampa. Tampa Bay Center hung on with only Sears, but then International Plaza opened nearby in 2001. International Plaza had lured Dillard's away from WestShore Plaza, and in early 2002, Sears moved into the old Dillard's location. Tampa Bay Center closed entirely after that. Sears announced on December 28, 2018 that the Westshore Plaza store would be among 80 stores to shutter nationwide in March 2019. New owner and demolition The mall was acquired by Malcolm Glazer and his family for $22.8-million in cash on December 31, 2002 to make way for a training facility for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Glazer paid $22.8-million for the mall, Jeff Testerman, St. Petersburg Times, January 18, 2003 It was demolished in 2005. The only remnants of the mall are the large sections of parking lots. The HARTline bus terminal was relocated to the southwest section of the property in 2007, known as the West Tampa Transfer Center.

The Atchafalaya Basin, or Atchafalaya Swamp (; Louisiana French: L'Atchafalaya, ), is the largest wetland and swamp in the United States. Located in south central Louisiana, it is a combination of wetlands and river delta area where the Atchafalaya River and the Gulf of Mexico converge. The river stretches from near Simmesport in the north through parts of eight parishes to the Morgan City southern area. The Atchafalaya is different among Louisiana basins because it has a growing delta system (see illustration) with wetlands that are almost stable.Louisiana Coast The basin contains about 70% forest habitat and about 30% marsh and open water. It contains the largest contiguous block of forested wetlands remaining (about 35%) in the lower Mississippi River valley and the largest block of floodplain forest in the United States. Best known for its iconic cypress-tupelo swamps, at , this block of forest represents the largest remaining contiguous tract of coastal cypress in the United States. Geographical features Time lapsed animation of basin from 1956 to 1993. The Atchafalaya Basin and the surrounding plain of the Atchafalaya River is filled with bayous, bald cypress swamps, and marshes, which give way to brackish estuarine conditions, and end in the Spartina grass marshes where the Atchafalaya River meets the Gulf of Mexico. It includes the Lower Atchafalaya River, Wax Lake Outlet, Atchafalaya Bay, and the Atchafalaya River and bayous Ch√™ne, Boeuf, and Black navigation channel. See maps and photo views of the Atchafalaya Deltas centered on . The basin, which is susceptible to long periods of deep flooding, is sparsely inhabited. The Basin is about in width from east to west and in length.Encyclopedia of Cajun Culture The Basin is the largest existing wetland in the United States with an area of , including the surrounding swamps outside of the levees that historically were connected to the Basin. The Basin contains nationally significant expanses of bottomland hardwoods, swamplands, bayous, and back-water lakes.Audubon Wetlands Campaign The Basin's thousands of acres of forest and farmland are home to the Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus), which has been on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service threatened list since 1992. The few roads that cross the Basin follow the tops of levees. Interstate 10 crosses the basin on elevated pillars on a continuous 18.2 mile (29,290 m) bridge from Grosse Tete, Louisiana, to Henderson, Louisiana, near the Whiskey River Pilot Channel at . The Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1984 to improve plant communities for endangered and declining species of wildlife, waterfowl, migratory birds and alligators.Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge, Fish and Wildlife Service Basin geology and flooding The Atchafalaya Basin has a long relationship with the Mississippi River throughout the Holocene epoch, and the geology of the modern basin is a direct manifestation of that relationship. The Atchafalaya Basin has been part of three historic depositional lobes (Sale-Cypremort, Teche, and Lafourche lobes) of the Mississippi River Delta Plain that formed south Louisiana, and active delta lobe development is currently occurring at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River and Wax Lake Outlet. The geology of the current basin has been driven by flows of Atchafalaya River water and sediment that flowed into open water areas through relict Mississippi River distributary channels. The Atchafalaya Basin contains lacustrine and coastal delta landscapes. Natural filling of the basin with sediment was accentuated with the building of the flood control levees that were completed in the 1940s. After the levees, sediment was directed into an area about one-third the size of the original basin. An example of the lacustrine delta development can be seen at Lake Fausse Pointe State Park, where levees severed the connection between the Grand Bayou distributary and the lake, and delta development was frozen in time. Geologically, the Atchafalaya River has been a backswamp, low area between the paths of the Mississippi River through the process of delta switching, which has built the extensive delta plain of Louisiana. The natural levees of the Mississippi River (on the east) and the levees along its previous course (now Bayou Teche) on the west define the Atchafalaya Basin.[Kolb, van Lopik (1958). Geology of the Mississippi River deltaic plain, southeastern Louisiana. Technical Report 3-483. Vicksburg, MS: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station] The central basin is further bordered by man-made levees designed to contain and funnel floodwaters released from the Mississippi at the Old River Control Structure and the Morganza Spillway south toward Morgan City and eventually to the Gulf of Mexico. Historically there were small and few channel connections to the Mississippi River. The historic lack of significant channel connection indicates that the Atchafalaya River Basin did not receive significant sediment from the Mississippi except during large floods. During the mid-19th century, manmade channel alterations, including the removal of a large log jam and dredging, permanently connected the Atchafalaya River to the Mississippi River. From then until the completion of the Old River Control Structure in 1963, the Mississippi was increasingly diverting flow into the shorter and steeper path of the Atchafalaya channel. By law, a regulated 30 percent of the latitudinal flow water from the Mississippi, Red and Black rivers is diverted into the Atchafalaya at the Old River Control Structure. This flow diverts on average 25 percent of the Mississippi River flow down the Atchafalaya. In times of extreme flooding, the US Army Corps of Engineers may open the Morganza Spillway and other spillways to relieve pressure on levees and control structures along the Mississippi. On May 13, 2011, in the face of a rising Mississippi River that threatened to flood New Orleans and other heavily populated parts of Louisiana, the USACE ordered the Morganza Spillway opened for the first time since 1973. This water floods the Atchafalaya Basin between the levees along the western and eastern limits of the Morganza and Atchafalaya basin floodways.Map Produced By Gmap4  Enhanced Google Map Viewer Degradation of the swamps The control of the river's floods, along with those of the Mississippi River, has become a controversial issue in recent decades. The US Geological Survey (USGS) reports that Mississippi River delta salt marshes are wetlands degrading at a rate of 29 square miles per year.USGS Fact Sheet: Louisiana Coastal Wetlands: A Resource At Risk, USGS.gov. The Atchafalaya River Deltas are the only locations of land growth along the Louisiana Gulf Coast. During the early 20th century, the Atchafalaya River Basin was designated as a spillway for floods of the Mississippi River. In order to facilitate this emergency plan without flooding adjacent agriculture and towns, protective levees were built dividing the Atchafalaya Basin Floodway from large portions of the historic swamp boundaries. A central channel was dredged through some existing channels and in some places through swamp forest. At that point the isolated Atchafalaya River Basin was permanently connected to a very large, sediment-rich river. From 1850 to 1950 open water decreased from 490 km¬≤ to 290 km¬≤. From 1950 to 2005 the amount of open water decreased to 190 km¬≤.Hale, L., Waldon, M.G., Bryan, C.F., Richards, P.A. (1999). \\"Historic patterns of Sedimentation in Grand Lake, Louisiana.\\" Proceedings, Recent Research in Coastal Louisiana Natural System Function and Response to Human Influence. Roza, L.P., Nyman, J.A., Proffitt, C.E., Rabalais, N.N., Reed, D.J., and Turner, R.E. (eds). Louisiana Sea Grant, Baton Rouge, La. When the Atchafalaya Basin flow plan was implemented (1950‚Äì1974), 30 percent of the total Atchafalaya River flow was designated to be directed off the main channel, 15 percent to the east and 15 percent to the west side. As a result of the Atchafalaya River channel bed incision, in the early 21st century the flow distribution is 13 percent of the total flow, with a flow distribution of 7 percent to the east side and 6 percent to the west side as reported by the USGS. This decrease in flow across the floodplain, in conjunction with high organic deposition from trees and floating vegetation and high water temperature, has resulted in large areas of low-dissolved oxygen water. Where once the water was black (1850), the water became brown (1927). Where the water was formerly brown (1927), it is now black (2009).Eos magazine, March 2009, Moeras van de verdwenen reuzen During the period of 1960‚Äì1980, oil and gas exploration and development in Louisiana increased dramatically. Numerous large access canals and pipeline canals were dredged through deep swamp areas, across bayous, and across the Atchafalaya River. In some areas of the Basin, there are 2 km or more of access canals to every 1 km of natural bayou. These large channels (30‚Äì50 m wide by 2‚Äì3 m deep) have fundamentally changed the hydrology of the swamps. Deep swamp areas that were hydraulically isolated from sediment were connected directly to the river and its sediment and suffered rapid filling. The USGS has measured sediment deposition rates of up to 30 cm per year where these channels enter open water, and 4 cm per year on adjacent floodplains. In some places natural bayous have filled in due to flow capture by access canals. Spoil material from the canals was deposited adjacent to the canals, further impeding the natural flow across the floodplain.  The Bayou Chene Community  thumb From 1830 to 1953, the community of Bayou Chene thrived as a center for logging, hunting, trapping, and fishing in the heart of the Atchafalaya Basin. Now buried underneath at least twelve feet of silt, Bayou Chene is one of several abandoned communities in the midst of the basin. The earliest settlers of the Bayou Chene region were the native Chitimacha tribe. Several villages important to the Chitimacha were located around Bayou Chene including the Village of Bones or Namu Katsi and the Cottonwood Village, known as Kushuh Namu in the Chitimacha language. One of the earliest written accounts of the Bayou Chene region comes from French explorer C.C. Robin who, while paddling through the Basin in 1803, wrote: \\"After long sinuosities which form innumerable islands, among which the inexperienced traveler would require the thread of Ariadne in order not to wander forever, the river opens suddenly into a magnificent lake of several leagues extent. The sudden light surprises the traveler and the beauty of the water, set about with tall trees, forms an enchanting sight.\\" By 1841, between fifteen and twenty families were farming along the banks of \\"Oak Bayou\\" or Bayou Chene. The population rose quickly over the next twenty years, as the United States Census of 1860 counted 675 residents in the community. By the 1870s, a majority of those living along Bayou Chene were involved in logging bald cypress, tupelo, and other bottomland hardwoods in the basin. By the early twentieth century, Bayou Chene was the center of the Atchafalya Basin's cypress and fur industry and housed many of the 1,000 full-time fisherman who fished the swamp's shallow bottoms. Writing about her family's experiences in the region, Gwen Roland describes how the community relied upon the basin's waters for everything, including transportation: \\"Out here on the Chene, our skiffs flare out on the sides so they float high like an acorn cap; it makes them quick to steer with an extra push on one oar or the other. This skiff floated deep and straight like a water trough or a coffin.\\" The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 nearly demolished the community. Rising seven feet above natural levees, the floodwaters inundated Bayou Chene for weeks. Local folklore says a village goat survived in the Methodist Church during this period on hymnals and wallpaper. The Great Depression hit the residents of Bayou Chene hard, but many former residents look fondly on the massive flood control projects promulgated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that provided gainful employment during the period. As a result of the 1927 flood, the entire Atchafalaya Basin was designated an official floodway and a series of man-made levees were built that would permanently alter flooding patterns in the region. Further flooding in 1937 encouraged many residents to move their homes to higher ground, but even these measures were not enough to protect the community from annual flooding. After years of rising waters, the community came to an end with the closing of the United States Post Office at Bayou Chene in 1952. Most of Bayou Chene's former residents relocated to the fringes of the basin in towns like New Iberia, St. Martinville, and Breaux Bridge. Today, little remains of the swamp community buried underneath the murky waters of the Atchafalaya.

Personal life Berkhof was born in 1873 in Emmen in the Netherlands and moved in 1882 with his family to Grand Rapids (Michigan). About the time he graduated from the seminary he married Reka Dijkhuis. They had four children before her death in 1928. He then married Dena Heyns-Joldersma who had two daughters. Education and career Berkhof entered the Theological School of the Christian Reformed Church in Grand Rapids at the age of 19, in which the studies included a 4-year literary course (expanded into Calvin College) and a 3-year theological course (expanded into Calvin Theological Seminary). During this period, he learnt under Hendericus Beuker who introduced him to the works of Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck. In 1900, he graduated from the seminary in Grand Rapids after which he was appointed pastor of the First Christian Reformed Church in Allendale Charter Township, Michigan. Two years later (1902), he attended Princeton Theological Seminary where he earned his B.D. in two years. He studied under B.B. Warfield and Geerhardus Vos during his time in Princeton. Subsequently, Berkhof returned to Grand Rapids to minister the Oakdale Park Church for another two years. In 1906, he joined the faculty of Calvin Theological Seminary and taught there for almost four decades. For the first 20 years he taught Biblical Studies until in 1926 he moved into the systematic theology department. He became president of the seminary in 1931 and continued in that office until he retired in 1944. Publications Berkhof wrote twenty-two books during his career. His main works are his Systematic Theology (1932, revised 1938) which was supplemented with an Introductory Volume to Systematic Theology (1932, which is included in the 1996 Eerdman's edition of Systematic Theology) and a separate volume entitled History of Christian Doctrines (1937). He wrote a more concise version of his Systematic Theology for high school and college students entitled Manual of Christian Doctrine, and later wrote the even more concise Summary of Christian Doctrine. He also delivered Princeton Theological Seminary's Stone Lectures in 1921. These were published as The Kingdom of God. In addition to this, he worked on many papers for the Christian Reformed Church as well as collections of sermons. Legacy Berkhof was not known for being original or speculative but for being very good at organizing and explaining basic theological ideas following in the tradition of John Calvin, Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck. Theologian Wayne Grudem has called Berkhof's Systematic Theology \\"a great treasure-house of information and analysis [...] probably the most useful one- volume systematic theology available from any theological perspective.\\"Grudem, Systematic Theology, Zondervan, 1994, pg. 1225 Berkhof's writings continue to serve as systematic presentations of Reformed theology. They are organized for use in seminaries and religious education as well as individual reference, though his systematics works are demanding reads. One of the prominent students of Berkhof is Cornelius Van Til, whose thoughts become the major position of the tradition of Westminster Theological Seminary in terms of apologetics and epistemology.

His tendency to play the cut and hook shots provided much entertainment, but also meant that he was inconsistent and error-prone. It has been said that the introduction of the batting helmet saved Darling's life several times, but also gave him extra confidence to play his favoured shots. Darling's early Test career was also characterised by his opening partnerships with Graeme Wood, the pair christened the \\"Kamikaze Kids\\" due to their often disastrous running between the wickets, which saw one of the pair dismissed run out in one innings of each of their four Tests together. Early life Darling is the great-nephew of Joe Darling, and learnt to play cricket at his family's home at Ramco on the Murray River. He started playing for the Salisbury Cricket Club in the Adelaide district competition in 1970‚Äì71. He was picked for South Australia Colts in 1974‚Äì75, scoring 67 against Victoria,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/131/131771.html 105 against Victoria,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/131/131773.html 48 against the West Indieshttps://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/140/140056.html and 45 against WA.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/132/132925.html =1975‚Äì76: First Class Debut= Darling started his first-class career in 1975‚Äì76 with South Australia. He made his debut against Queensland, batting at number 6, being run out for 5.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/35/35701.html (Darling would later become notorious for being involved in run outs throughout his career.) He then made 26 and 48 against Victoria, helping South Australia win the game.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/35/35747.html He scored 2 against the touring West Indians.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/35/35778.html A second innings of 29 helped guide South Australia to victory against Western Australia.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/35/35834.html He also made 2 and 32 against WA,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/35/35895.html 1 and 41 against Victoriahttps://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/35/35902.html and 12 against NSW.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/35/35913.html South Australia won the Sheffield Shield that year. =1976‚Äì77= Darling's Sheffield Shield scores for the 1976‚Äì77 season were 2 and 14,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/36/36622.html 0 and 25,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/36/36641.html 3 and 64.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/36/36655.html He made his initial first class century with 107 against Victoria.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/36/36663.html Then made 1 and 39,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/36/36763.html 22 and 4https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/36/36822.html and 7.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/36/36854.html Darling made his one-day debut in the Gillette Cup quarter finals but only scored one.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/36/36684.html Test player =1977‚Äì78= Darling was given his chance in the Australian Test team through the defection of several players to World Series Cricket in 1977. At the beginning of the 1977‚Äì78 season he was 12th man for South Australia against the Indian team. He got back into the team and scored runs, playing particularly well against Western Australia, making 45 and 100.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/37/37636.html He made 101 against Tasmania in a one-day game, which saw him come into discussions about possibly opening for Australia.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/37/37778.html His other knocks were 0 and 43 against Victoriahttps://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/37/37663.html and 39 and 15 against WA.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/37/37727.html Australia had struggled to find a consistent opening partner during the first four tests. Darling was selected for the fifth test and subsequent tour of the West Indies. Also selected was Graeme Wood and it was thought these two could make an ideal combination, although Wood was only 21 and Darling just 20. =Test debut= Australia's gamble on Wood and Darling made dividends with the two of them putting on 89 for the first wicket, Australia's best opening partnership of the series. Darling made 65. He followed his up with 56 in the second innings, helping Australia win the game. =West Indies tour= Darling began the West Indies tour well, scoring 26 and 35 against Leeward Islands then 105 and 43 against Trinidad and Tobago. He missed the first test due to injury, but recovered and made 62 against Barbados. He made 8 in the first ODI but 21 in the second. Darling was picked for the second test but failed twice, making 4 and 8. A knock of 123 against Guyana restored his confidence but he failed twice again in the third test, making 15 and 0. Darling made 12 and 36 against the Windward Islands (doubling as wicketkeeper) and failed again in the fourth test, making 10 and 6. According to one report \\"Darling has developed an unfortunate habit of committing himself to the front foot, always looking to work the ball on the leg side. Yesterday he was bowled when he moved too far inside the line to glance and left his leg stump exposed.\\" Darling had made 43 runs in six test innings. He was dropped from the team for the fifth test, being replaced by David Ogilvie. Bob Simpson said he would have preferred a specialist opener \\"but we couldn't really persevere with Rick.\\" Australia came close to winning the game before the crowd rioted and the match ended in a draw. Darling did finish the tour however with 75 against Bermuda Counties. However it had been a disappointing tour for Darling, who now found his position in the Australian side in doubt. =1978‚Äì79 Ashes= Darling began the 1978‚Äì79 season failing twice for South Australia against the touring English team, making 17 and 1.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/38/38611.html He then made 39 against Tasmania.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/38/38643.html He was omitted for the first test side with Australia using Wood and Gary Cosier as openers. They failed to put on a strong opening stand and when Darling scored 85 and 82 against NSWhttps://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/38/38665.html he was recalled for the second test, with Cosier dropped down the order. \\" \\"I'm happy that we now have two experienced opening batsmen in Wood and Rick Darling, and I am confident that they will be able to give us a sound start,\\"\\" said captain Graham Yallop. This did not turn out to be the case with Darling only scoring 25 (run out) and 5. He made 19 and 41 for South Australia against England.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/38/38744.html Darling and Wood put on two 50-plus opening stands in the third test, helping Australia to a rare victory. Darling made 33 (run out) and 21. Darling's finest Test innings was 91 against England at Sydney in the 4th Test. He helped Australia to a first innings lead but they collapsed in the second innings (Darling made 13; it was Wood's turn to be run out) and lost badly. Darling was injured in a fielding mishap. \\"I just could not hold a bat\\", he said. \\"Frankly I don't think I'll be able to play again for at least a week\\". This saw him omitted for a one-day match against England (he was replaced by Andrew Hilditch). However he kept his place for the fifth test. It was the next match for which Darling is perhaps most famous though, as he was struck on the chest by a delivery that lifted viciously from fast bowler Bob Willis. The blow caused Darling's chewing gum to become lodged in his throat, and he collapsed on the pitch, not breathing. English spinner John Emburey was first on the scene, and thumped Darling on the chest, allowing him to breathe again. Umpire Max O'Connell then provided mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and Darling was taken off the field: > \\"All I can remember is, Bob Willis had this big inswinging, in-dipping > action\\", Darling says. \\"The ball was pitched well outside off stump was the > last thing I remember. Once it swung in, it also cut in further. I was > caught in no man's land. I was sort of caught out of position, and hit in > the chest. Unfortunately, at the time, I was chewing a chewy, and I > swallowed my tongue and chewy as well. That caused me to black out.\\" He returned to the crease the following day, but could only make 15 runs. Darling: > I knew the Englishmen would test me out as soon as I walked out. Ian Botham. > Bob Willis. I remember facing Ian Botham when I went out there, and he did > test me out. Fortunately enough I did hook him for a six, but I must admit > it was more of a top edge. Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, > and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few > more times. Darling made 9 in the second innings and Australia fell to a crushing 205-run loss, which allowed England to retain The Ashes. English captain Mike Brearley attributed his team's success to its ability to get through the Australian batting order. \\"The biggest problem is to break the opening pair. Rick Darling and Graeme Wood\\", he said. \\"At times they have played very well, but we have found that once we can get one of them cheaply we have been able to dismiss numbers three, four and five with the new ball.\\" Darling was dropped for the sixth test in favour of Hilditch. He kept his place in the one day side but performed poorly. He made 36 against NSW,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/38/38899.html 17 and 22 against Queensland.,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/38/38915.html and 1 and 34 against WA.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/38/38939.html =Pakistan Series= He was recalled to the Australian side for the second test against Pakistan, replacing Graeme Wood. \\"Darling has been unlucky throughout the series\\", said Yallop. Darling responded with 79 for South Australia against Pakistan.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/38/38966.html Darling had an excellent return to the test side, fielding brilliantly and scoring 75 in the first innings, putting on 96 with Hilditch. A similar knock of 79 in the second innings helped Australia win and Darling won the man of the match award. It was reported that World Series Cricket officials had offered Darling a contract for the upcoming 1979/80 WSC season (which did not eventuate).Australian Cricket, \\"People...\\", March 1979, p. 5. Darling had been unemployed for six months but went to work for Hindmarsh Building Society, sponsors of the South Australian side. Career batting graph for Rick Darling Darling was described as one of the most nervous first-class cricketers, often biting his fingernails before he went out to bat. =1979 World Cup= Darling was selected to play for Australia in the 1979 World Cup. He made 60 in a warm up game against New Zealand but failed to impress in the official games, with scores of 25 (against England), 13 (against Pakistan) and 13 (against Canada). =1979 India tour= Darling was selected for Australia's tour of India in 1979. He fell ill with a stomach ailment early in the tour. Then later he was hit in the face while fielding, meaning he only batted once in the lead up games, making 34 against North Zone. Eventually Darling was ruled unfit and Wood took his place. Darling returned to the team for the second test, replacing Dav Whatmore but was dismissed cheaply for 7 in the first innings, and did not bat in the second innings due to illness. 82 in a tour game against Central Zone restored his confidence. In the third test he was injured again while fielding. Darling batted down the order and scored a fighting 59. He opened in the second innings and scored only 4. According to a contemporary report, \\"In a team of complex characters, Darling is perhaps the most complex. He is a tremendously talented batsman dragged back by acute nervousness. Sometimes he gets so worked up thinking about batting that he has to run off the field and be physically ill in the dressing room. Darling's problem has always been with him. It is the main reason why he has been made into an opener, when his technique and attacking flair make him more suited to a position down the order.\\" Darling made 27 and 3 against West Zone and was dismissed cheaply twice in the fourth test, 19 and 7. He was dropped down the order for the fifth and sixth tests. In the fifth he made 39 and 7; in the 6th it was 16 and 0. In the final Test, Darling was hit on the head attempting a hook shot from a Kapil Dev bouncer, and was carried off the field and forced to retire hurt with no score to his name. His head split open, Darling was taken to hospital, where, according to Bob Merriman, the doctors refused to stitch him up until he signed an autograph for them. (Darling later said this was untrue.) Post-WSC career =1979‚Äì80= Darling began the 1979‚Äì80 season superbly with 88 against the West Indies for South Australia.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/39/39759.html \\"I can see that if I want to get back in the Test side I will have to concentrate on opening because there seems to be plenty of middle-order batsmen\\", he said. However, when picked to play against the West Indies for a Tasmanian Invitational XI he made 1; then when he asked to bat down the order he was dismissed for 15. Against NSW he made 42 and 10https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/39/39789.html then impressed against England with 45 and 75 not outhttps://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/39/39801.html and 50 against WA.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/39/39855.html Darling was unable to force his way back into the test team but was selected to play for Australia in the one day side. He made 20. He followed this with 134 against Queensland in a Sheffield Shield game, his fifth first class century.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/39/39957.html He was injured while fielding later in the season. =1980‚Äì81= Darling began the next summer well with 81 against Tasmania.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/40/40689.html He suffered more injury problems hurting his thigh in a game against Western Australia. Highlights of the summer included 61 against India,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/40/40763.html 65 against Victoriahttps://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/40/40868.html and 50,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/40/40991.html plus 51 in a McDonald's Cup semi final.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/40/40959.html =1981‚Äì82: Return to the national side= Darling had an excellent season in 1981‚Äì82. He made 72 against NSWhttps://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/41/41770.html and 88 against the West Indies.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/41/41788.html When Graham Yallop fell injured, Darling was recalled to the Australian one day team. He made 41 against Pakistan, featuring in another run out with Graeme Wood, but being Australia's second top scorer. Later innings included 5 against the West Indies, 35 against Pakistan (where Darling was run out again) and 74 against Pakistan (Australia's top score, Darling run out again, Pakistan won). He had a run of low scores ‚Äì 7 against the West Indies, 5 (run out) against Pakistan and 20 against the West Indies. He made 132 and 58 not out for South Australia against Pakistan.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/41/41883.html However he was dropped from the one day team. Darling made 134 against Victoriahttps://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/41/41950.html which saw him back in the one day team. \\"Darling is chancy with the bat but the selectors are banking on his coming good in their moment of need\\", wrote the Canberra Times. \\"He now has 659 runs in first-class cricket this season and brings the bonus of brilliant cover fielding.\\" He made a useful 34 against the West Indies, helping Australia to a victory. He made 14 in the next game then was dropped again from the squad in favour of David Hookes. He and Hookes were placed on standby for the Australian team for the Test in Adelaide against West Indies in case Greg Chappell and Kim Hughes were unable to field. Other notable innings that year included 88 and 52 against Tasmania,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/42/42041.html and 121 against West Australia.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/42/42073.html He also made a half century in the McDonald's Cup semi final.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/40/40971.html South Australia won the Sheffield Shield at the end of the season. Darling's batting was a crucial part of the state's success. His omission from the 1982 tour of Pakistan surprised several observers. =1982‚Äì83: Serious injury= Darling took some time to get going form-wise at the start of the 1982‚Äì83 season. He was beginning to find form with 98 against NSW.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/42/42956.html His next match was against Queensland; Darling was 17 when he was hit on the face by a delivery from John Maguire. He suffered bleeding in the eye and lacerations and had to spend several days in hospital.https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/42/42996.html He returned to the team two months later. He played one game, making 15 and 4,https://cricketarchive.com/SouthAustralia/Scorecards/43/43274.html then declared himself unavailable due to personal commitments.

The Star Wolf is a \\"Liberty Ship\\", officially designated the LS-1187. Plagued by misfortune throughout the series, without any confirmed kills to its credit, it was denied a name by Command.  Antagonists  The main antagonists are the members of the Morthan Solidarity, originally a group of genetically improved humans. \\"Voyage...\\" explains that while a rational mind would have tried to improve rationality in genetic modifications, humans improved self- preservation and physical attributes. Sociologically, they were educated not to be a subspecies, but a superspecies of humanity. Their name is a neologism from \\"more-than\\". 1,500 years prior to \\"Voyage of the Star Wolf\\", the most aggressive and highly evolved Morthans broke away from the human sphere and invented a highly ritualised culture far from human-inhabited space, genetically improving every generation in comparison to the last. It is rumoured in \\"Voyage...\\" that reproduction is exclusively through artificial wombs; as the Morthans are said to waste nothing and allocate resources to maximum effect, it is speculated that Morthans would consider it wasteful to breed a woman when for the same investment, they could also get a full warrior. A full-blown war erupts in the course of \\"Voyage of the Star Wolf\\", as the Morthan Solidarity starts an offensive against the Terran Alliance.  Tie-in to other books by Gerrold  The central computer of every Liberty ship is a H.A.R.L.I.E. sentient computer as described in When HARLIE Was One. The Chtorrans from The War Against the Chtorr are mentioned at least once in \\"Voyage of the Star Wolf\\", possibly setting it into a \\"space age\\"-future some 2,000 years after the war against the Chtorr. A Tribble is mentioned as a source of a \\"fluctuator\\" malfunction and it is stated that in Med, the medic has a cage full of them. Books * Voyage of the Star Wolf (1990) * The Middle of Nowhere (1995) * Blood and Fire (2004), which is a rewrite of a planned Star Trek: The Next Generation script featuring gay characters and an AIDS metaphor. The novel contains several slams against the Star Trek franchise, such as stating how another starship nicknamed \\"Big E\\" (the US Navy's unofficial nickname for the Enterprise) was too valuable in terms of propaganda to risk on the front lines, and a dead crewmember named \\"M. Okuda.\\" * Yesterday's Children (1972), later significantly expanded and republished as Starhunt (1985). It occurs prior to the other novels in the series' main continuity, but is not perfectly consistent with them. Gerrold had planned to develop this concept into a TV series, as he writes in an introduction to Voyage of the Star Wolf. The later novels were written after the TV concept had been presented. The Star Wolf series reflects Gerrold's contention that, due to the distances involved, space battles would be more like submarine hunts than the dogfights usually portrayed--in most cases the ships doing battle wouldn't even be able to see each other. Gerrold referred to the concept as \\"World War II in space,\\" and intended it as a stylistic opposite of Star Trek (particularly its Next Generation incarnation) by setting the main characters on a small, dingy spacecraft that had little respect in the fleet rather than on the flagship. His inability to sell the concept as a television project led to the book series. In spite of the strong contrast between the Starwolf series and Star Trek, the original germ of \\"Yesterday's Children\\" was in the framing story of Gerrold's early proposed 2-part Star Trek episode \\"Tomorrow Was Yesterday\\". The central story, without the frame, eventually became Gerrold's Star Trek novel The Galactic Whirlpool.

The village primary school was closed around 1970 and is now used as the village hall, which was renamed Jubilee Hall in 2000 and extensively refurbished in 2012. People =At Theberton Hall= William Light, founding father of Adelaide, South Australia, was sent from Penang in about 1792, aged six, to be educated by friends of his father, George and Anne Doughty, who lived at Theberton Hall. George Doughty (d. 21 August 1798) was Sheriff of Suffolk, and it was he who had had Theberton Hall built. His wife, Anne Goodwin, was heiress of Martlesham Hall (d. 12 May 1829). Their son was Rev. George Clarke Doughty, also of Theberton Hall. (Trove catalogue entry here) Charles Montagu Doughty (1843 ‚Äì 1926) the traveller and writer, best known for his 1888 travel book Travels in Arabia Deserta, was born at Theberton Hall and is commemorated in the church by a plaque. Theberton Hall was also the birthplace of his nephew, Lt-Col. Charles Doughty-Wylie, who was born in 1868 and killed in battle in Gallipoli in 1915. His bravery earned him the Victoria Cross, awarded posthumously. =Robert Howlett= The Victorian photographer Robert Howlett was born in Theberton in 1831, the second of four sons of Reverend Robert Howlett and Harriet Harsant. He is renowned for his iconic photograph of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Heritage buildings =Theberton Hall= Theberton Hall was built for George Doughty (d. 21 August 1798) in 1780 or 1792 (architect unknown). In 1852 there were extensive alterations and extensions, in Italian Renaissance style, but nearly all of the additions were demolished in the 1920s. It is a two-storey building of yellow brick, stone and with stucco decoration. The central doorway has a porch with square pillars and Ionic columns, and the parapet bears the motto \\"PALMA NON SINE PVLVERE\\", with the coat of arms above. It remained the home of Charles Montagu Doughty and on 25 October 1951 it was listed as a Grade II heritage-listed building. The motto comes from the Roman poet Horace, with the literal meaning \\"no palms without dust\\" (the palms referring to the prize awarded to the winners of chariot races). It is usually translated as \\"no reward without effort\\" and sometimes more recently as \\"dare to try\\". In 1928, Mrs Doughty-Wylie (presumably Lilian, the widow of Charles Doughty-Wylie, and the only woman on the Allied side to visit Gallipoli during the campaign, when she went to lay a wreath on his grave on 17 November 1915) offered \\"to commemorate the old friendship between the family of the late Colonel Doughty-Wylie and that of Colonel William Light\\", Theberton Hall and the estate to Adelaide City Council. The estate was described as \\" in extent, including of matured woodlands\\", while the house had \\"six reception rooms and 18 bed and dressing rooms\\". The Council referred the matter to High Commission of Australia, London for consideration. The investigators reported that home was said to be in poor repair, and would require immediate expenditure of ¬£7,000 to ¬£8,000, as well as ongoing expense, so the Council declined to accept the offer.  Twinning  Theberton is twinned with Thebarton, a suburb of Adelaide in South Australia. Thebarton is named after the home of William Light, which he named Theberton House.

He was considered to be a superlative composer both by his contemporaries and by modern scholars; however, his surviving output is small, and he died young. Life Until the 1960s, he was confused with another somewhat older composer named Barbingant. Barbireau was probably born in Antwerp, and both of his parents were citizens there. By 1482, he had attained the title of Master of Arts, so he likely went to university in the 1470s. He wanted to study with the humanist and musician Rodolphus Agricola, who was active at Ferrara in the 1470s and later Heidelberg, and several letters written by Agricola to Barbireau have survived; one of them gives useful clues about Barbireau's life. According to it, Barbireau was already active as a composer by 1484, and implies that his fame had not yet spread outside of his native Antwerp. Barbireau may have been attached to the Church of Our Lady in Antwerp since childhood. Since 1482, the church was the center of his life. It is also probably the reason why it was impossible for him to study with Agricola. In 1484, succeeding Antoine de Vigne, he became Kapellmeister, a position he held until his death. Although Barbireau was registered in the account books of the church as singing master or magister choralum from 1487, he had probably held the post from as early as 1484. In 1485 as a schoolmaster, he paid a contribution to the Capellan√≠a Our Lady of Nieuwwerk, a foundation created for singing teachers. At that time, the choir led by Barbireau consisted of twelve singers. Emperor Maximilian I evidently held him in high regard, and when Barbireau went to Buda in Hungary in 1490, Queen Beatrix also spoke highly of him. Evidently his health was poor for about the last nine years of his life. He died in Antwerp, not long after returning from Hungary, on 7 August 1491. In his will, he designated as heirs the woman he married after 1487 and the daughter he had with her, Jacomyne Barbireau (born after 1487, died after 1525). The death of the composer inspired the humanist Judocus Beyssel to write three epitaphs, in which he described Barbireau as \\"notabilissimus modulator\\" and laments the composer's untimely death. Music The library of the cathedral in Antwerp was destroyed by religious fanatics in 1556, incluing probably most of Barbireau's music. Some, however, has survived, in sources such as the Chigi Codex. What has survived is of outstanding quality. \\"Barbireau shows a degree of contrapuntal polish and melodic-harmonic resourcefulness that puts him firmly on a par with such composers as Isaac and Obrecht.\\"Rob Wegman, The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2001). Two masses have survived as well as a Kyrie for the Easter season, and a motet on texts from the Song of Songs, Osculetur me, for four voices. The mass for five voices, Missa virgo parens Christi, is a cantus firmus mass and has an unusual arrangement where the voices have divisi parts, indicating that at least ten actual voices would be required to sing it. In this composition the textural contrasts are high, with striking homophonic passages alternating dynamically with polyphonic, and with fast-moving parts weaving around the slower-moving parts. Also featured in this mass are alternating duos (bicinia) in a call-response fashion. The motet Osculetur me uses low voice tessituras reminiscent of Ockeghem. Of his secular music, the song Een vroylic wesen, for three voices, became a 'hit' song all over Europe, appearing in numerous arrangements from places as far apart as Spain, Italy and England; Heinrich Isaac used it as the basis for his own Missa Fr√∂lich wesen. Three of his surviving secular songs were used as the basis for masses, both by Isaac and Jacob Obrecht.

Memnonia includes these topographical regions of Mars: * Arcadia Planitia * Amazonis Planitia * Lucus Planum * Terra Sirenum * Daedalia Planum * Terra Cimmeria Recently, evidence of water was found in the area. Layered sedimentary rocks were found in the wall and floor of Columbus Crater. These rocks could have been deposited by water or by wind. Hydrated minerals were found in some of the layers, so water may have been involved. Many ancient river valleys including Mangala Vallis, have been found in the Memnonia quadrangle. Mangala appears to have begun with the formation of a graben, a set of faults that may have exposed an aquifer. Dark slope streaks and troughts (fossae) are present in this quadrangle. Part of the Medusae Fossae Formation is found in the Memnonia quadrangle.  Layers  Columbus Crater contains layers, also called strata. Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Sometimes the layers are of different colors. Light-toned rocks on Mars have been associated with hydrated minerals like sulfates. The Mars Rover Opportunity examined such layers close-up with several instruments. Some layers are probably made up of fine particles because they seem to break up into fine dust. Other layers break up into large boulders so they are probably much harder. Basalt, a volcanic rock, is thought to in the layers that form boulders. Basalt has been identified on Mars in many places. Instruments on orbiting spacecraft have detected clay (also called phyllosilicate) in some layers. Recent research with an orbiting near-infrared spectrometer, which reveals the types of minerals present based on the wavelengths of light they absorb, found evidence of layers of both clay and sulfates in Columbus crater.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier.NY. This is exactly what would appear if a large lake had slowly evaporated.Wray, J. et al. 2009. Columbus Crater and other possible plaelakes in Terra Sirenum, Mars. Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 40: 1896. Moreover, because some layers contained gypsum, a sulfate which forms in relatively fresh water, life could have formed in the crater. Scientists are excited about finding hydrated minerals such as sulfates and clays on Mars because they are usually formed in the presence of water. Places that contain clays and/or other hydrated minerals would be good places to look for evidence of life. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers.

Craters Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters will display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed unto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface. At times, bright rays surround craters because the impact has gone down to a bright layer of rocks, then thrown out the bright rocks on the darker surface. An image below from Mars Global Surveyor shows this. Image:Bright rays in Memnonia.JPGBright rays caused by impact throwing out a bright lower layer. Some bright layers contain hydrated minerals.

Ridges Ridges on Mars may be due to different causes. Long straight ridges are thought to be dikes. Curved and branched ridges may be examples of inverted topography, and groups of straight ridges that cross each other may be the result of impacts. These intersecting box-like ridges are called linear ridge networks. Linear ridge networks are found in various places on Mars in and around craters.Head, J., J. Mustard. 2006. Breccia dikes and crater-related faults in impact craters on Mars: Erosion and exposure on the floor of a crater 75 km in diameter at the dichotomy boundary, Meteorit. Planet Science: 41, 1675-1690. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments that intersect in a lattice-like manner. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind.

The wind direction probably changed to cause this.  Dark slope streaks  Many places on Mars show dark slope streaks on steep slopes like crater walls. It seems that the youngest streaks are dark; they become lighter with age.Schorghofer, N, et al. 2007. Three decades of slope streak activity on Mars. Icarus. 191:132-140. Often they begin as a small narrow spot then widen and extend downhill for hundreds of meters. Several ideas have been advanced to explain the streaks. Some involve water. or even the growth of organisms. The streaks appear in areas covered with dust. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust. Fine dust settles out of the atmosphere covering everything. We know a lot about this dust because the solar panels of Mars Rovers get covered with dust. The power of the Rovers has been saved many times by the wind, in the form of dust devils, that have cleared the panels and boosted the power. From these observations with the Rovers, we know that the process of dust coming out of the atmosphere then returning happens over and over. It is most generally accepted that the streaks represent avalanches of dust.Ferris, J. C.; Dohm, J.M.; Baker, V.R.; Maddock III, T. (2002). Dark Slope Streaks on Mars: Are Aqueous Processes Involved? Geophys. Res. Lett., 29(10), 1490, The streaks appear in areas covered with dust. When a thin layer of dust is removed, the underlying surface is dark. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust. Dust storms are frequent, especially when the spring season begins in the southern hemisphere. At that time, Mars is 40% closer to the sun. The orbit of Mars is much more elliptical then the Earth's. That is the difference between the farthest point from the sun and the closest point to the sun is very great for Mars, but only slight for the Earth. Also, every few years, the entire planet is engulfed in a global dust storm. When NASA's Mariner 9 craft arrived there, nothing could be seen through the dust storm. Other global dust storms have also been observed, since that time. Dark streaks can be seen in the image below taken with HiRISE of the central mound in Nicholson Crater. At least one streak in the image splits into two when encountering an obstacle. Research, published in January 2012 in Icarus, found that dark streaks were initiated by airblasts from meteorites traveling at supersonic speeds. The team of scientists was led by Kaylan Burleigh, an undergraduate at the University of Arizona. After counting some 65,000 dark streaks around the impact site of a group of 5 new craters, patterns emerged. The number of streaks was greatest closer to the impact site. So, the impact somehow probably caused the streaks. Also, the distribution of the streaks formed a pattern with two wings extending from the impact site. The curved wings resembled scimitars, curved knives. This pattern suggests that an interaction of airblasts from the group of meteorites shook dust loose enough to start dust avalanches that formed the many dark streaks. At first it was thought that the shaking of the ground from the impact caused the dust avalanches, but if that was the case the dark streaks would have been arranged symmetrically around the impacts, rather than being concentrated into curved shapes.Kaylan J. Burleigh, Henry J. Melosh, Livio L. Tornabene, Boris Ivanov, Alfred S. McEwen, Ingrid J. Daubar. Impact air blast triggers dust avalanches on Mars.

This term is derived from Latin; therefore fossa is singular and fossae is plural. Troughs form when the crust is stretched until it breaks. The stretching can be due to the large weight of a nearby volcano. A trough often has two breaks with a middle section moving down, leaving steep cliffs along the sides; such a trough is called a graben. Lake George, in northern New York State, is a lake that sits in a graben. Other ideas have been suggested for the formation of fossae. There is evidence that they are associated with dikes of magma. Magma might move along, under the surface, breaking the rock and more importantly melting ice. The resulting action would cause a crack to form at the surface. Dikes caused both by tectonic stretching (extension) and by dikes are found in Iceland. An example of a graben caused by a dike is shown below in the image Memnonia Fossae, as seen by HiRISE. It appears that the water started coming out of the surface to form Mangala Vallis when a graben was formed. Image:Graben in Memnonia Fossae.JPGGraben in Memnonia Fossae, as seen by HiRISE. This graben is believed to be the result of magmatic dikes rather than regional tectonic stretching. The scale bar is 1000 meters long. Image:Sirenum Fossae.JPGSirenum Fossae, as seen by HiRISE.

It is used in planetary geology for the naming of landform features on other planets, including what could be old river valleys that were discovered on Mars, when probes were first sent to Mars. The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; huge river valleys were found in many areas. Space craft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.Raeburn, P. 1998. Uncovering the Secrets of the Red Planet Mars. National Geographic Society. Washington D.C.Moore, P. et al. 1990. The Atlas of the Solar System. Mitchell Beazley Publishers NY, NY. Some valles on Mars (Mangala Vallis, Athabasca Vallis, Granicus Vallis, and Tinjar Valles) clearly begin at graben. On the other hand, some of the large outflow channels begin in rubble-filled low areas called chaos or chaotic terrain. It has been suggested that massive amounts of water were trapped under pressure beneath a thick cryosphere (layer of frozen ground), then the water was suddenly released, perhaps when the cryosphere was broken by a fault.Carr, M. 1979.

The program is a unique hybrid of standard two-dimension map-based tactical gaming, and first person action. It is set in World War II. The game was developed by Code Fusion and Digi4Fun. At the time of release, it could lay claim to being \\"the ONLY true war strategy game that puts you in the middle of the action\\". Gameplay The player selects forces and moves them on the two- dimensional battle map, while a tactical AI would battles; however, the player can jump from unit to unit, taking over in a first person capacity. Gameplay is action-oriented, and damage modelling is unrealistic in the extreme. Heavy machine guns can be used to knock stone buildings into piles of rubble, for example. Limitations of the game engine restrict engagement ranges to a few hundred metres. Up to 100 units can be controlled in the overhead two- dimensional mode. The three-dimensional mode uses a simplistic graphics interface for vehicle controls. Players could control British, American, or German forces. Weather effects were included, such as snow and rain falling in the 3D world, and terrain was realistic and textured, with such things as bullrushes in the swampy areas and decorative lamp posts in the urban areas. Sound effects are good, though all voices in the game spoke with a British accent, giving sometimes comical responses \\"Get out! Get out!\\" when infantry were unloaded, for example, or an apologetic \\"oops\\" when a civilian was crushed under your tank. Terrain is deformable, with trees being crushed under the weight of vehicles and buildings collapsing under high explosive fire. Development Code Fusion was a US subsidiary of Digi4Fun, which was created for holding the exclusive US distribution rights. The game was based on the Pharlap DOS Extender, which enabled it to run beyond the limit of 640K.

They were an illegitimate cadet line of the House of Ivrea. The line of Trast√°maran royalty in Castile ruled throughout a period of military struggle with Aragon. Their family was sustained with large amounts of inbreeding, which led to a series of disputed struggles over rightful claims to the Castilian throne. This lineage ultimately ruled in Castile from the rise to power of Henry II in 1369 through the unification of the crowns under Ferdinand and Isabella. 14th century: toward unification with Aragon =Peter I and the Rise of Trast√°mara= Upon the death of the Castilian King Alfonso XI in 1350, his eldest son, Peter, took control of the Castilian throne as Peter I of Castile. Peter was born to Alfonso and his wife, Maria of Portugal, but Alfonso lived out a long and public affair with Eleanor of Guzman. Alfonso's illegitimate children by Eleanor, known collectively as the Trast√°maras, immediately became rivals of the newly crowned Peter. Because of a personal history including political murders, his enemies quickly nicknamed him Peter the Cruel. Also increasing the hostilities between Peter and his half brothers was the act of Peter's mother taking the opportunity of his power to have Eleanor of Guzman arrested and executed. Peter first resisted an attempt at his crown by defeating a coalition led by Henry of Trast√°mara (for whom Peter's half siblings derived their surname) in 1356. Peter again defeated his rivals at N√°jera in 1360 and had his half brothers Juan and Pedro executed. Having been protected by Aragon, Henry was forced to flee to France when the Castilian crown signed a peace treaty with Aragon in 1360. Henry supervising the beheading of his rival Peter, from the Grandes Chroniques de France. Gaining support throughout Castile because of his relation to Alfonso XI and Peter's continuous military escapades, Henry built an alliance with Aragon and France, including mercenaries led by French constable Bertram Du Guesclin for another attempt at the Castilian crown in 1365. Peter gained the support of Edward the Black Prince, heir to the English throne and son of Edward III of England, to help defend his crown with the promise of territorial gains. On 13 April 1367, Peter and Edward's forces strongly defeated the armies of Francs, Aragonese, and Castilians led by Henry and captured Bertram Du Guesclin. As Edward fell ill, and sick with Peter's attempts to get Edward's prisoners executed, and perhaps with Peter's delay or failure to fulfill his promises of land to England, the Plantagenets withdrew from their direct battlefield support of the Castilian Crown to the new front in Gascony opened to the French. In March 1369, with the continued support of France and Aragon, and growing support in important cities in parts of Castile, Henry's forces again invaded the Castilian Crown's realm and checked Peter's army. Henry of Trast√°mara himself was responsible for the death of his brother, Peter I of Castile. =Reign of Henry II= Following his killing of his half brother, Peter I, Henry of Trast√°mara took control of the crown of Castile as Henry II. Under Henry, a new nobility rose in prominence to gain land grants of large estates and vast royal privileges. The public rise of this new class of nobles caused discontent and instability in Castile. This class of nobility was driven by their desire to reclaim family holdings and was generally compelled to use any means necessary. Despite the instability, Henry's forces were able to withstand Portuguese, Navarrese, and Granadian attempts to invade and take control of Castile. Henry made an agreement with the ruler of Aragon, Peter IV, to have their children wed. Henry's son, John, was married to Peter IV's daughter, Eleanor, on 18 June 1375. This marriage by Henry's son would eventually put the Trast√°maras in control of both Castile and Aragon, comprising a majority of the Iberian Peninsula. After giving birth to three children, Eleanor died in 1382, after only seven years of marriage. The Trast√°maras‚Äô rule in several realms Upon Henry II's death in 1379, his son John came to power as John I of Castile. During his reign, John took Beatrice, daughter of King Ferdinand I of Portugal, as his second wife. On the basis of this marriage, John made an unsuccessful claim to the throne of Portugal upon Ferdinand I's death in 1383, a move that possibly could have led to the unification of all of the Iberian Peninsula. John died very unexpectedly in 1390. Upon his untimely death, John's eldest son Henry came to the throne as Henry III, at the very young age of twelve. He waited only two years to independently take control of the throne in 1393 at only fourteen, amidst a great deal of violence being carried out against Jews throughout Castile. Among the young king's accomplishments was his taking of control of the Canary Islands, providing Castile with a holding in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1406, amidst an invasion by Granada's forces in Murcia, Henry died while planning a response at the age of 27. John II, Henry III's son, was left as the only heir upon Henry's death in 1406, but he was only two years old. Henry's brother, Ferdinand, served as regent, along with John's mother, Catherine of Lancaster. During his time as regent, Ferdinand was chosen as the ruler of Aragon, due to his maternal relation to the Aragonese throne through the Compromise of Caspe in 1412. The Trast√°maras now ruled in both the realms of Castile and Aragon. 1418‚Äì69: Conflict within the House of Trast√°mara =John II and Don √Ålvaro= √Ålvaro de Luna in Ca√±ete John II came to power upon his mother's death in 1418. He was now a cousin to the King of Aragon, as Alfonso ascended to the throne upon Ferdinand I's death. John married Maria, the sister of Alfonso V of Aragon. Alfonso himself had already married John's sister, Maria, making the two rulers both cousins and brothers-in-law twice over. John II was now also a cousin and brother-in-law to Alfonso's brothers John and Henry, known collectively as the Infantes of Aragon, who had been given large amounts of land in Castile while their father worked as regent during John II's childhood. John II lacked widespread authority, and Castile became a battlefield for nobles to gain power and political influence. In 1420, just two years after coming to power, John was kidnapped by his cousin Infante Henry. Henry ruled on John's behalf for much of the year until John was able to escape because of the help of his friend, and eventual royal favorite, √Ålvaro de Luna, who was known as Don Alvaro. In 1429, Alfonso V ordered the Infantes to lead a joint attack on Castile. Now John II's constable, Don Alvaro, agreed to a basically victorious truce, as the Aragonese branch of Trast√°maras was removed from Castile. John II's authority continued to decline following this military engagement, and he eventually ceded all power to Don Alvaro, who created an oligarchy of nobles. Don Alvaro lost this power in 1439 to a nobility which was allied with Alfonso V, and in 1443, John II was once again captured by Infante John of Aragon, throwing Castile into near anarchy. This confusion was settled in 1445, when a group of nobles favoring the monarchy, led by Don Alvaro, won a battle at Olmedo. Infante Henry was killed as a result of this battle. In 1453, Don √Ålvaro was publicly beheaded for charges of tyranny. In July of the following year, John II died and his son Henry became King Henry IV of Castile. =Henry IV and the rise of Isabella I= Henry IV of Castile was an unpopular ruler, in part because of his taste for Moorish fashion and his disagreement with military engagement with Granada. He was married at the age of 15 in 1440 to John II of Aragon's daughter, Blanche. John II had succeeded to the throne of Aragon upon the death of his brother Alfonso V of Aragon. This marriage failed, however, as a result of Henry's inability to consummate it. He was remarried in 1455 to Joan of Portugal. Queen Joan gave birth to Princess Joan in 1462, and she was recognized by the Cortes as Henry's legitimate successor. In 1464, charges were raised by powerful noble families that Princess Joan was the daughter of one of Henry's favourites, The 1st Duke of Alburquerque. These powerful noble families eventually forced Henry IV to hand over power to his brother Alfonso in 1465, but Alfonso suddenly died a month later. Amidst the struggle to settle the ensuing claims to the throne, Henry's wife Joan became pregnant again while being held as a hostage of a noble family. This sign of misbehavior further weakened her daughter Princess Joan's claim to the throne, and paved the way for Henry's half-sister Isabella to take power. =Pact of the Toros de Guisando and War of Succession= The Pact of the Toros de Guisando was signed in 1468 and named Isabella heir to Henry's throne, as she and the nobles renewed their allegiance to Henry in return. A quick marriage for Isabella was a condition of the agreement, however Henry objected to her 1469 marriage to Ferdinand, who was the King of Sicily and the heir to the Aragonese throne, as a breach of the pact. He once again named his daughter Joan as his heir, and a civil war ensued throughout the next decade. Isabella's military factions were eventually victorious with the help of Aragon, making her queen and uniting the crowns of Aragon and Castile.

Some other remains of it can be found in Summit, Millburn, and Union Township.  The Proposed Railroad  The earliest charter was granted by the New Jersey Legislature in March 1865 for the Passaic Valley and Peapack Railroad, which was to run from \\"some point in the county of Union or the county of Essex\\" via Springfield Township (Union), New Providence, and Basking Ridge to Peapack. That is, it would run between the Morris and Essex Railroad (M&E;) to the north and the Central Railroad of New Jersey to the south. The charter was amended in 1867 to continue the road west to the Delaware River at any point between Holland and Frenchtown. In 1868, a further amendment allowed the company to vary the route up to three miles from the points stated. In 1869, the railroad was authorized to build a bridge to Pennsylvania near Milford. This was not obviously useful since there was no railroad on the Pennsylvania side near Milford. It looked as if the Passaic Valley and Peapack was being manipulated as part of some larger plan. But money for the road had been raised by the usual procedure of selling bonds to investors in the towns along the line, so ostensibly it was under local control. The company's name was changed in February 1870 to the New Jersey West Line Railroad. By this date, the route of the first segment had been determined. From Bernardsville to Summit it followed the present-day Gladstone Branch. It then crossed to the north of the Morris and Essex Railroad to pass through the northwestern part of Summit, and crossed the M&E; again east of Millburn. From there it would run through Union and enter Newark from the south. Construction began in 1870. The bondholders began arguing with management in June 1870, slowing progress. In the later part of 1871 the bondholders welcomed in Asa Packer and others involved with the Lehigh Valley Railroad, a Pennsylvania coal carrier that wanted to secure its own route from Easton, Pennsylvania to tidewater. As part of the plan Packer began buying shorefront land in Perth Amboy for a coal port that he said would be reached by a branch line. A test train was operated between Summit and Bernardsville in December 1871 and newspapers reported that a switch would be laid to allow NJWL trains to run to the M&E; station in Summit. Passenger service on this segment, now part of the Gladstone Branch, began on January 29, 1872, and freight service began the next month. In February 1872 the company under Asa Packer's control obtained authorization to continue east into Hudson County to the Hudson River, and to build a branch west to Phillipsburg (opposite Easton). However, later the same year the Lehigh Valley Railroad obtained a charter for the Easton and Amboy Railroad which was immediately put under construction, opening in 1875. Its route south of the Central of New Jersey was clearly superior with easier grades and curves. In June 1872, the contentious bondholders of the NJWL voted Packer out. The future of the NJWL now appeared to be that of a rural branch line dependent on the Morris and Essex connection at Summit as its only connection to the national rail network. However the partially built line to Newark was not yet abandoned. Advertising for a residential development called Wyoming, between Millburn and Maplewood in September 1872 mentioned not only the Morris and Essex station but also a station on the New Jersey West Line, \\"now rapidly completing\\". Whether this was wishful thinking is uncertain, but the Panic in September 1873 must have killed any last hopes.  Unfinished section in Summit, Millburn, and Union  Unused NJWL Grade in Millburn Although only the section between Bernardsville and Summit was opened by the NJWL, right-of-way was acquired from Summit to Newark and construction was started. To varying degrees this portion was graded, bridge abutments were built, wooden trestles were installed, and portions of track may have been laid. Work stopped by 1873, but the property was not sold off until 1901. Later development has obscured much of the right of way. In Summit, the crossing of the Morris and Essex was at a point south of Kent Place Boulevard and west of High Street. At this time the Morris and Essex ran north of its present alignment so the crossing is on the north side of the present railway just east of the point where the Gladstone Branch diverges. Crossing Kent Place Boulevard, the NJWL alignment ran through what is now school grounds (the current location of Summit High School), across Morris Avenue, and behind the houses on the south side of Bedford Road. East of Woodland Avenue, Llewellyn Road follows the right of way, and east of Bellevue Avenue, a 1929 map shows another small street called Lyric Lane also on the right of way. The line took a turn southeast just before reaching the Morris and Essex Turnpike and entered Millburn just north of Hobart Gap Road. To some extent all of this route in Summit follows property lines. In Millburn, the NJWL routing through Short Hills is totally obscured. Short Hills was developed starting in 1874, right after the New Jersey West Line failed, so its street plan bears almost no relation to the path of the railroad. The NJWL would have crossed about the junction of Hobart Gap Road and White Oak Ridge Road, and then would have gone north to run along the south side of Western Drive, which was possibly named for the NJWL with a possible station location around Taylor Place or Highland Avenue. Early maps naturally show the NJWL property, but the chances of it being built diminished quickly as the 1870s went on. Some remains can be found east of Glen Avenue. First the curving southern end of Woodcrest Avenue follows the NJWL alignment, and this curve continues to a dry-stone wall that can be seen on the west side of Brookside Drive (park in the dirt space on the east side of the road to view it). From here a timber trestle was constructed across the valley that was known as the Ghost Bridge (shown here at getnj.com) since no track was ever laid on it. East of the river, the graded right of way can still be seen inside the South Mountain Reservation. It starts as an embankment and continues into a wide cut, passing the site of an old quarry, continuing past the present-day parking lot opposite Lackawanna Place, and continuing straight to Glen Avenue, and onward as a property line to the Morris and Essex tracks. The portion from the quarry to the M&E; had track laid for some decades into the early 20th century as a freight siding serving the quarry, so it is well preserved. The remaining portion in Millburn south of the M&E; is totally obscured by later construction, but across the border in Union are two interesting remains. First a street named West Line Avenue runs from the river to Valley Street, and then on the other side of Valley Street a pair of streets called East Side Avenue and West Side Avenue flank the right of way for the short distance down to Springfield Avenue. The neighborhood around these latter two streets is formed entirely of narrow streets and small lots. Its relation to the NJWL is not known. East of Springfield Avenue the right of way is impossible to discern today. It ran southeast following generally Vauxhall Road and crossed the river into Hillside near Brookside Avenue, Union, where there were traces of a bridge abutment. It then turned northeast, crossing modern U.S. Route 22 near Liberty Avenue and entering Newark just west of Elizabeth Avenue. The proposed route in Newark is obscure.  Completed Section: Gladstone Branch  The operating segment of the New Jersey West Line did not have enough income to pay its costs, as it served small farms and an undeveloped region, and the company fell into receivership in 1878. The property was foreclosed on and sold on August 3, 1878 an official of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, its only connection, for $51,580. The new company was called the Passaic and Delaware Railroad. For many years the Gladstone Branch was known to railroad employees as the \\"P and D\\", but it was operated by the DL&W; from 1878 onward as a branch of the Morris and Essex. The DL&W; formally leased the line on November 1, 1882. The DL&W; obtained a charter in 1890 for the Passaic and Delaware Extension Railroad, intended to continue the branch to Gladstone. The extension was built in only six months, opening in October. The extension includes a very short tunnel west of Far Hills. Despite the grand company title, the DL&W; never tried to extend the line farther west to the Delaware River. (This was the second railroad to reach Peapack and Gladstone, the Rockaway Valley Railroad having opened in April the same year built its line north from White House on the CNJ. It is indicative of the railroad fever of the 1890s that such a small village would be the object of two railroads, and that a wealthy carrier like the DL&W; would react so quickly to the plans of a small and financially shaky \\"competitor\\". The RV was abandoned in 1913.) The Gladstone Branch was converted to electric passenger operation in January 1931, but freights continued to run on steam until dieselization in March, 1953. Passenger trains ran to the terminal at Hoboken. The usual off-peak service for about six decades in the mid-20th Century consisted of a pair of Gladstone cars that were cut in and out of mainline Morris and Essex trains at Summit. The line was amazingly rural in nature, consisting of a single main track with passing sidings and hand-thrown switches worked by train crews. After New Jersey Transit took over operations in 1983 some of the sidings were removed, severely limiting reverse-peak services, and the practice of cutting cars in and out of trains ended, requiring passengers to change trains, usually at Summit. Beginning in June 1996 some peak trains were operated directly to and from Penn Station, as part of the Midtown Direct service. Any expansion of current service levels is problematical due to lack of storage space at Gladstone.

It emerged in the seventeenth century under the leadership of the first sultan, Abd al-Karim, who overthrew the ruling Tunjur people of the area. It occupied land previously held by the Sultanate of Darfur (in present-day Sudan) to the northeast of the Sultanate of Baguirmi.  History  = Origins = Prior to the 1630s, Wadai, also known as Burgu to the people of Darfur, was a pre-Islamic Tunjur kingdom, established around 1501.https://www.britannica.com/place/Wadai The Arab migrants to the area which became Wadai claimed to be descendants of the Abbasid Caliphs, specifically from Salih ibn Abdallah ibn Abbas. Yame, an Abbasid leader, settled with Arab migrants in Debba, near the future capital of Ouara (Wara). In 1635, the Maba and other small groups in the region rallied to the Islamic banner of Abd al-Karim Al Abbasi, who was descended from an Abbasid noble family, led an invasion from the east and overthrew the ruling Tunjur group, who at the time was led by a king named Daud. Abd al-Karim was the son of Yame the Abbasid. Abd al-Karim secured and centralized his power in the area by marrying the Tunjur King Daud's daughter, Meiram Aisa, and then forming other marriage pacts with local dynasties and tribes, such as the Mahamid and Beni Halba tribes. Abd al-Karim became the first Kolak (Sultan) of a dynasty that lasted until the arrival of the French. During much of the 18th century, the history of Wadai is marked by wars with the Sultanate of Darfur and in the early 1700s under the rule of Abd al-Karim's grandson, Ya'qub Arus (1681‚Äì1707), the country suffered terrible drought that lasted for several years. =Expansion= Wadai sultanate east of Lake Chad around 1890, from an American map After 1804, during the reign of Muhammad Sabun (r. 1804 ‚Äì c. 1815), the Sultanate of Wadai began to expand its power as it profited considerably from its strategic position astride the trans-Saharan trade routes. A new trade route to the north was found, via Ennedi, Kufra and Jalu- Awjila to Benghazi, and Sabun outfitted royal caravans to take advantage of it. He began minting his own coinage and imported chain mail, firearms, and military advisers from North Africa. Sabun's successors were less able than he, and Darfur took advantage of a disputed political succession in 1838 to put its own candidate in power in Ouara, the capital of Wadai. This tactic backfired, however, when Darfur's choice, Muhammad Sharif, rejected Darfur's meddling and asserted his own authority. In doing so, he gained acceptance from Wadai's various factions and went on to become Wadai's ablest ruler. Sharif conducted military campaigns as far west as Bornu and eventually established Wadai's hegemony over Baguirmi and kingdoms as far away as the Chari River. In Mecca, Sharif had met the founder of the Senussi Islamic brotherhood, a movement that was strong among the inhabitants of Cyrenaica (in present-day Libya) and that was to become a dominant political force and source of resistance to French colonization. =Decline= Last charge of the cavalry. Armed with spear, bow and sword, and accompanied by deafening music, Wadai's forces held to the old methods- mass cavalry charges followed by the infantry. These were insufficient against modern weapons. View of Ab√©ch√©, with buildings constructed by the last sultan of Wadai, 'Asil Kolak. Photo after French annexation, c. 1918 Sultan Dud Murra of Wadai opposed French domination until being overcome on June 6, 1909, with the occupation of the capital Ab√©ch√© by French troops where a puppet sultan was installed. Resistance continued until the last independent sultan, 'Asil Kolak, was captured in 1912 bringing the independence of the sultanate to an end. The Wadai Sultanate was reconstituted under French suzerainty in 1935, with Muhammad Urada ibn Ibrahim becoming Kolak, or sultan. The sultanate continues under the suzerainty of the Republic of Chad and its current Kolak since 1977 is Ibrahim ibn Muhammad Urada. It became part of the independent Republic of Chad on that country's independence in 1960. The Ouadda√Ø Region of modern Chad covers part of the area of the old kingdom. Its chief town is Ab√©ch√©.

Such levels are common in human solid tumors, a phenomenon known as tumor hypoxia. Thus, tirapazamine is activated to its toxic form preferentially in the hypoxic areas of solid tumors. Cells in these regions are resistant to killing by radiotherapy and most anticancer drugs. Thus the combination of tirapazamine with conventional anticancer treatments is particularly effective. , tirapazamine is undergoing phase III testing in patients with head and neck cancer and gynecological cancer, and similar trials are being undertaken for other solid tumor types. Chemically it is an aromatic heterocycle di-N-oxide. Its full chemical name is 3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4 dioxide. Originally it was prepared in a program screening for new herbicides in 1972. Its clinical use was first described by Zeman et al. in 1986. While tirapazamine has had only limited effectiveness in clinical trials, it has been used as a lead compound to develop a number of newer compounds with improved anti-cancer properties. An update of a Phase III trial (Tirapazamine, cisplatin, and radiation versus cisplatin and radiation for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (TROG 02.02, HeadSTART): a phase III trial of the Trans- Tasman Radiation Oncology Group) found no evidence that the addition of TPZ to chemoradiotherapy, in patients with advanced head and neck cancer not selected for the presence of hypoxia, improved overall survival. Two possible molecular mechanisms of TPZ, for generating reactive oxygen species which causes DNA strand break, have been considered widely. In hypoxia, under bioreductive condition, it has been observed that TPZ primarily produces hydroxyl or and benzotriazinyl radicals as the DNA damaging reactive species.. A new clinical phase I trial of Tirapazamine combined with embolization in liver cancer has been received in June, 2014. This study will help to optimize the safe tolerable dose of TPZ, when it is administered with embolization in liver cancer. Treatment of solid tumors is complicated by the fact that these are often poorly provided with blood vessels, thus limiting their exposure to cytotoxic agents. Attempts have, however, been made to take advantage of the resulting hypoxic environment by designing drugs that are nonreactive until they are reduced to reactive species in oxygen-deficient tissues. This, it is hoped, will lead to enhanced selectivity. The azaquinoxaline dioxide function on the antineoplastic agent tirapazamine, for example, has been shown to give reactive nitroxide radicals on reduction.  Synthesis  Tirapazamine synthesis:K. Ley et al., ; eidem, (1973, 1975 both to Bayer). The first step in the synthesis, condensation of 2-nitroaniline (1) with cyanamide, probably involves initial formation of a guanidine such as 2. This then cyclizes to the heterocycle 3. Oxidation with hydrogen peroxide then completes the preparation of tirapazamine (4).

While wine is made in all fifty U.S. states, up to 90% (by some estimates) of American wine is produced in the state. California would be the fourth largest producer of wine in the world if it were an independent nation.California Wine Month 2007: General Info. Retrieved 11 July 2007. History =Early years= Although conflicting accounts exist, the first recorded planting of a vineyard was probably by the Spanish Jesuit Missionary Eusebio Francisco Kino at Misi√≥n San Bruno in Baja California in 1683 implanting the first variety named \\"Mision√©ro\\". In 1779, Franciscan missionaries under the direction of the Spanish Father Jun√≠pero Serra planted California's first vineyard at Mission San Juan Capistrano. Journals kept at San Juan Capistrano show that between May 1779 and 1781, the padres supervised six campesinos from Baja California in planting 2,000 grapevines at the mission. The first winery in Alta California was built in San Juan Capistrano in 1783; both red and white wines (sweet and dry), brandy, and a port-like fortified wine called Angelica were all produced from the Mission grape. Father Serra founded eight other California missions. Hence, he has been called the \\"Father of California Wine\\". The variety he planted, presumably descended from Spain, became known as the Mission grape and dominated California wine production until about 1880.LaMar, Jim., Professional Friends of Wine,\\"Wine 101: History\\" . Retrieved on April 6, 2007 1889 advertisement for California wine by J. Gundlach & Co. of the Sonoma Valley In 1829, 17 acres of Mission Grape vines were planted in Pueblo de Los Angeles by Ysidro Reyes, (grandson of Juan Francisco Reyes the 3rd & 5th Alcade de Pueblo) Ysidro Reyes had been born at Mission San Gabriel where he had learned to cultivate and ferment this hardy grape. All of the Missions raised this grape for sacramental wine, but the residents of the Pueblo developed a taste for drinking wine. The fermentation process consisted of placing the grapes into a cowhide hung loosely from four trees or posts. A popular drink was the fortified wine known as Angelica It is unknown if Reyes was the first commercial winemaker in Los Angeles, but he appears to have supported his family solely from his role in producing wine. In 1831, Reyes had the good fortune of becoming the neighbor of newly arrived French cooper and distiller Jean- Louis Vignes who would serve as a mentor to young Reyes. Upon arriving in Los Angeles in 1831, Jean Louis Vignes had bought and cultivated 104 acres of land located between the original Pueblo and the banks of the Los Angeles River. He named his property El Aliso after the centuries- old white alder tree found near the entrance. He planted a vineyard and started preparing to make wine. Vignes early experiments, while waiting for his own vines to mature, were with his neighbor Ysidro Reyes' newly producing vineyards. During the three years that it took for Vignes' vines to begin producing grapes, the two men worked well together and became friends with Vignes serving as a mentor to Reyes in improving the quality of the wine. The Mission grape grew well and yielded large quantities of wine, but Vignes was not satisfied with the results even after attempting to discern if aging it would improve the taste. The common practice at the time was to drink the wine as soon as it was fermented unless it were to be made into Angelica, a fortified wine distilled similarly to Port. Vignes decided it was necessary to import better vines from Bordeaux, Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc.Idwall, Jones. Vines in the Sun: A Journey Through the California Vineyards. William Morrow and Co. New York, 1949. Page 212 The vines transited around Cape Horn. To preserve their roots during the long trip, they were inserted in moss and potato slices. Vignes became the first Californio who grew quality vines, and the first who aged his wines. By the time Ysidro Reyes left Pueblo de Los Angeles in 1839 to plant the vineyard of his newly awarded Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, he had become a skilled vintner, with an excellent source for aging barrels and a wagon load of grafts from Vignes' European Bordeaux grapes that would flourish in the fertile Santa Monica Canyon. The exact date of Vignes first vintage from the European vines is unknown. However, it was may have been 1837, because in 1857 he ran an advertisement claiming that some of his wines were 20 years old.Newmark, Harris, Sixty Years in Southern California 1853-1913. Fourth Edition. Dawson's Book Shop, Los Angeles 1984. Page 200 The wood for the barrels came from land Vignes owned in the San Bernardino Mountains.Foucrier, Annick. Op. Cit.

Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1951. Pages 13-14. While Jean-Louis Vignes is recognized as California's first documented importer of European wine vines, planted on his land in Los Angeles in 1833. he was quickly followed by William Wolfskill, another major early wine maker in California, who purchased his first vineyard in 1838 in the Los Angeles area. By 1858 he owned 55,000 vines across 145 acres.Carosso, Vincent P. The California Wine Industry 1830-1895. University of California Press. Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1951. Page 11 Vignes and Wolfskill were the two major figures in California wine making in the 1830s and 1840s. Their success attracted others and increased interest in wine cultivation in Southern California.Carosso, Vincent P. The California Wine Industry 1830-1895. University of California Press. Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1951. Page 14. In 1840, Jean-Louis Vignes made the first recorded shipment of California wine. The Los Angeles market was too small for his production, and he loaded a shipment on the Monsoon, bound for Northern California.Foucrier, Annick. Op. Cit. Page 53 By 1842, he made regular shipments to Santa Barbara, Monterey and San Francisco. By 1849, El Aliso, was the most extensive vineyard in California. Vignes owned over 40,000 vines and produced 150,000 bottles, or 1000 barrels, per year.McGroarty, John Steven. History of Los Angeles County. The American Historical Society. Chicago and New York 1923. Page 31 As a prominent citizen of Los Angeles, Jean-Louis Vignes met and entertained such well known men as General William Tecumseh Sherman, Thomas Larkin, William Heath Davis and Thomas ap Catesby Jones. His wine was drunk all over California and samples were sent to President Tyler in Washington, D.C.Davis, William Heath. Seventy Five Years in California. John Howell. San Francisco. 1929. Page 120 and to France. The California Gold Rush (1848‚Äì1855) had a major effect on the geography, economy, and history of wine growing in California. The Gold Rush brought an influx of people to Northern California, many of whom arrived and settled in San Francisco (whose population grew from 1,000 to 25,000 between January 1848 and December 1849). This resulted in a significant increase in demand for wine and spurred wine production in the area within 100 miles of San Francisco. The 1850s saw planting and wine production expand in earnest in many parts of Northern California, including in Santa Clara, Sutter County, Yuba County, Butte County, Trinity County, El Dorado County, Lake County, Napa County, Sonoma County, Merced, and Stockton.Carosso, Vincent P. The California Wine Industry 1830-1895. University of California Press. Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1951. Pages 16-20. Many of these are still major centers of wine cultivation and production. Established in 1852, Old Almaden Winery in Santa Clara Valley was the oldest winery in California [4] and the site is designated as a California Historical Landmark designated July 31, 1953.[1] Coordinates 37.23761¬∞N 121.892951¬∞W. The Old Almaden Winery (official name: Almaden Vineyards) in San Jose, California is a historic wine production site in Santa Clara County situated on the eastern slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains in what today attributes to winemakers and growers in the Santa Clara Valley AVA. On this site, in 1852, Charles LeFranc made the first commercial planting of fine European wine grapes in Santa Clara County to found Almaden Vineyards.California Office of Historical Preservation, \\"Almaden Vineyards\\" The winery is no longer in operation, the Almaden Vineyards company moved to Madera, California. In 1878, pioneering winemaker Paul Masson left France for California, and ended up becoming winemaker at Almaden Vineyards and Wine company, leading to his other pioneering wine and champagne vintner pursuits in the Santa Clara Valley and Santa Cruz Mountains. In the 1850s and 1860s, Agoston Haraszthy, a Hungarian soldier, merchant and promoter, made several trips to import cuttings from 165 of the greatest European vineyards to California. Some of this endeavor was at his personal expense and some through grants from the state. Considered one of the founders of the California wine industry, Haraszthy contributed his enthusiasm and optimism for the future of wine, along with considerable personal effort and risk. He founded Buena Vista Winery and promoted vine planting over much of Northern California. He dug extensive caves for cellaring, promoted hillside planting, fostered the idea of non-irrigated vineyards and suggested redwood for casks when oak supplies ran low. As home to both Buena Vista winery, California's oldest commercial winery, and Gundlach Bundschu winery, California's oldest family-run winery, the Sonoma Valley is known as the birthplace of the California wine industry. Although George Yount planted a small vineyard in Napa Valley in the mid-1830s, John Patchett planted the first commercial vineyard in Napa Valley in 1854 and established the first winery there in 1858. In 1861 Charles Krug who previously had worked for Agoston Haraszthy and Patchett founded his namesake winery in St. Helena and began making his own wine. Originally a Prussian political dissident, Krug learned the trade of the vintner as an apprentice to Haraszthy in the Sonoma Valley. The land on which Krug founded his winery was part of his wife's (Carolina Bale's) dowry. Krug became an important leader of winemaking in the Napa Valley. He was also a mentor for Karl Wente, Charles Wetmore and Jacob Beringer, all of whom became important vintners. Californian Burgundy, 1906 poster from the London wine merchants showing a bottle on Glacier Point, Yosemite In 1863, species of native American grapes were taken to Botanical Gardens in England. These cuttings carried a species of root louse called phylloxera which attacks and feeds on the vine roots and leaves. Phylloxera is indigenous to North America and native vine varieties had developed resistance. European vines had no such evolutionary protection. By 1865, phylloxera had spread to vines in Provence. Over the next 20 years, it inhabited and decimated nearly all the vineyards of Europe. Many methods were attempted to eradicate phylloxera but all proved temporary and none economical. Finally Thomas V. Munson, a horticulturist in Texas, suggested grafting the European vinifera vines onto American riparia rootsocks. So, there began a long, laborious process of grafting every wine vine in Europe over to American rootstocks. It was only in this manner that the European wine industry could be retrieved from extinction. In 1879 Captain Gustave Niebaum established Inglenook Winery in Rutherford, California a small village (in Napa County, California). It was the first Bordeaux style winery in the USA. Captain Niebaum's wines became world-renowned. His Inglenook wines won gold medals at the World's Fair of Paris in 1889. During the period when the Europeans were contending with phylloxera, the American wine industry was flourishing. By 1900, America had a fully developed and proud commercial wine producing business. Many California wines received medals in European competitions. Barrels of California wine were being regularly exported to Australia, Canada, Central America, England, Germany, Mexico and Asia. =Prohibition= The destruction of the American wine industry would come not from phylloxera but from Prohibition in the United States. Thirty-three states had gone dry at the outbreak of World War I. Wartime Prohibition was enacted in 1919, followed by the Volstead National Prohibition Act and the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, forbidding the \\"manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors.\\" Through a loophole allowing each home to \\"make 200 gallons of non-intoxicating cider and fruit juice per year,\\" thousands of otherwise law-abiding citizens became home winemakers and bootleggers. Prices for fresh grapes shot up, because of the increased demand and a railroad shortage of refrigerated freight cars in which to ship them. Growers began replanting fine wine variety vineyards to juice grape varieties that shipped well. The massive plantings produced a constant surplus of low- quality grapes that persisted until 1971. By the time of National Repeal, effective December 5, 1933, the industry was in ruins. Although some wineries managed to survive by obtaining permits to make wines used for medicinal, sacramental and non-beverage additive purposes, production dropped 94% from 1919 to 1925. =Repeal= Even after Repeal of Prohibition, several states stayed dry: Kansas until 1948, Oklahoma until 1957, and Mississippi until 1966. Seventeen states chose to establish monopoly liquor stores with limited selections. Today 10% of the US area and 6% of the population remain dry. Anticipating Repeal, speculators and others soon flooded the legal market with quickly and poorly made wine. Dilettantes published books and articles warning Americans about rigid rules that must be followed to serve the proper wine with the proper food from the proper glass at the proper temperature. Faced with low quality products with which to risk committing social blunders and while remaining uncertain about the social acceptance of any alcohol, most Americans stayed away. The only group of wines that sold well were the fortified dessert wines. Taxed at the lower rate of wine as opposed to distilled spirits, but with 20% alcohol, this group made the cheapest intoxicant available. Before 1920, table wines accounted for 3 of every 4 gallons shipped. After 1933, fortified wines were 3 of every 4 gallons shipped. It was not until 1968 that table wines sales finally overtook fortified wines, regaining the status of most popular wine category. Before 1920, there were more than 2,500 commercial wineries in the United States. Less than 100 survived as winemaking operations to 1933. By 1960, that number had grown to only 271. California had 713 bonded wineries before Prohibition; it took more than half a century, until 1986, before that many were again operating. Prohibition left a legacy of distorting the role of alcohol in American life and ruining a fledgling world-class wine industry, which took decades of work to overcome. Research at the University of California at Davis and Fresno State University greatly assisted the new breed of vintners who arrived in California in the 1960s and who were committed to producing wine of the highest international standards. =Wine revolution= Andr√© Tchelistcheff is generally credited with ushering in the modern era of winemaking in California. Beaulieu Vineyards (BV) founder and owner Georges de Latour hired Tchelisticheff in 1938. He introduced several new techniques and procedures, such as aging wine in small French Oak barrels, cold fermentation, vineyard frost prevention, and malolactic fermentation. Brother Timothy; a member of Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools was also very instrumental in the creation of the modern wine industry. After an earlier career as a teacher, he transferred to the order's Mont La Salle located on Mount Veeder in the Mayacamas Mountains west of Napa in 1935 to become the wine chemist for the order's expanding wine operations. The Christian Brothers had grown grapes since 1882 made wine in Martinez, California. During Prohibition they legally made sacramental wine. In 1932, they relocated to Napa, and returned to commercial production of wine and brandy following the repeal of Prohibition. The science teacher was a fast learner and soon established Christian Brothers as one of the leading brands in the state's budding wine industry; Brother Timothy's smiling face in advertisements and promotional materials became one of the most familiar images for wine consumers across the country. In 1965, Napa Valley icon Robert Mondavi broke away from his family's Charles Krug estate to found his own in Oakville, California. It was the first new large-scale winery to be established in the valley since before prohibition. Following the establishment of the Mondavi estate, the number of wineries in the valley continued to grow, as did the region's reputation. Some California wine makers began to produce quality wines but still had difficulty marketing them. Frank Schoonmaker, a prominent journalist and wine writer of the 1950s and 1960s introduced the German idea of labeling wines using varietal (Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Riesling) rather than semi-generic names borrowed from famous European regions (Burgundy, Chablis, Rhine, etc.). Robert Mondavi was one of the first to label the majority of his wines by varietal names and was tireless in promoting the practice. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the quality of some vintners' wines was outstanding but few took notice. On May 24, 1976, a blind tasting was held in Paris with a panel made up exclusively of French wine experts. After comparing six California Chardonnays with four French Chardonnays, three of the top four were Californian. Six of the nine judges ranked Chateau Montelena the highest; Chalone Vineyard came in third and Spring Mountain Vineyard fourth. When reds were evaluated, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars was ranked number one. This competition, now known as the \\"Judgement of Paris\\", focused a great deal of attention on wines from the Napa Valley. The red wines evaluated in 1976 were retasted in two separate blind tastings (the French Culinary Institute Wine Tasting of 1986 and the Wine Spectator Wine Tasting of 1986) and also in The Wine Rematch of the Century. In all retastings, a California red was chosen first, while the French wines lost positions in the rankings. In Oz Clarke's New encyclopedia of Wine, Mr. Clarke writes that California \\"was the catalyst and then the locomotive for change that finally prised open the ancient European wineland's rigid grip on the hierarchy of quality wine and led the way in proving that there are hundreds if not thousands of places around the world where good to great wine can be made.\\" He observes that \\"until the exploits of California's modern pioneers of the 1960s and '70's, no-one had ever before challenged the right of Europe's, and in particular, France's vineyards, to be regarded as the only source of great wine in the world.\\" Fred Franzia and his Bronco Wine Company has caused recent waves in the business of California wine marketing. The company's low priced Charles Shaw wine which is sold exclusively by Trader Joe's markets along with the company's other labels have attracted new entry level wine consumers to the fold but also has alienated many of the smaller vintners in the state by placing some downward pressure on pricing. Newer regions, producing award- winning wines, have entered the California wine industry, including Temecula Valley wine country in the south, the Santa Ynez valley in the central coast, and in the Red Hills Lake County in the north. In the early 21st century, vintners have begun reviving heirloom grape varieties, such as Trousseau Gris and Valdigui√©. Immigration and the California wine industry The Californian wine industry has had a long history of employing migrant workers to tend to the vineyards and assist at harvest time. Its close proximity to Mexico has opened the possibility to some of those workers being classified as undocumented or illegal. Karen Ross, president of the California Association of Winegrowers, has estimated that as of 2007 the number could be as high as 70% of the employees in the California wine industry may be illegal. New immigration regulations announced by the Department of Homeland Security required all employers to fire illegal workers or face paying a fine up to $10,000 for each infraction. In August, following a lawsuit by the AFL-CIO union, a federal judge placed a restraining order on the enactment of the new regulations pending further review. Industry experts predict substantial changes will come into the Californian wine industry as results of the changing labor and immigration laws which will result in higher prices for consumers in the public market.D.

As a character embodying Communist ideals, Octobriana was said to be usable by anyone who wanted, rather than being copyrighted by an author or corporation. This made her, in part, the inspiration for the creation of Jenny Everywhere. Petr Sadeck√Ω had created a fictitious real life origin for the character, which he presented as true. Octobriana and the Russian Underground In Octobriana and the Russian Underground, Sadeck√Ω describes the PPP as a loose group of cells, not only in Russia, but throughout the Soviet Union. This group, Sadeck√Ω wrote, started around 1957, after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1956. At first they called themselves Progressivnaya Politika (Progressive Politics) and tried to go back to the pure principles of the White movement and their Scandinavian roots; the Rus' people. They were descendants of the Vikings. Later they put together samizdat comics about the superheroine Octobriana, a character said to embody the principles of the Russian Revolution and battle against both Russian and American oppression. Sadecky provided a history for Octobriana where she is said to be thousands of years old and the child of a Viking and a Toltec princes, whose original name was Mahari (which means \\"divine maiden\\" in Sanskrit). She was given radiation treatments that made her immortal and reborn as a superhuman in a radioactive volcano. Her ethnicity has often shifted; the initial Amazona character seems to have been a confused mix of different indigenous backgrounds. In Sadecky's book, she was said to have Mongolian features. Later portrayals have often ignored this and rendered her as white. Sadecky portrayed her as a legendary figure who has been sighted throughout history; there are reports from Siberia, Spain in the time of the Spanish Inquisition, Chinese explorer Zhang Qian, and an unpublished book by left wing Moroccan politician Mehdi Ben Barka. She has been called The White She-Dragon, The Girl with the White Face Coming from the Sky, The Mother of the Seven Red Stars, Angelic Maiden who Turned into a Devil, the Avenger. It is said that she comes from an ancient civilization and was granted immortality by radiation treatments, then underwent an ordeal in a radioactive volcano which transformed her into a superhuman being. She pilots the Wonder Machine, which travels through time and space, crewed by Native Americans. Her weapons and equipment include a Smith & Wesson revolver, a kris knife, and a shark-tooth necklace which can detect radiation. One story was \\"The Living Sphinx of the Kamchatka Radioactive Volcano 1934\\", in which she swims into a radioactive volcano and kills a giant walrus with her kris. Afterwards she brings the tribesmen of the Koryaks home with a giant flying ball. Another story was titled \\"Octobriana and the Atomic Suns\\". The Octobriana hoax The supposed origin of the character was in actuality Sadeck√Ω's own creation. Petr Sadeck√Ω, while still in Prague, enlisted the help of two Czech artists, Bohumil Koneƒçn√Ω and Zdenƒõk Burian, in creating a comic centering on the character of \\"Amazona.\\" Sadeck√Ω told the two that he had a buyer interested in the comic, and they worked together on writing and illustrating the Amazona comic. However, Sadeck√Ω betrayed his friends by stealing all the artwork and escaping to the West where, in his efforts to market the Amazona comic, he changed the dialogue, drew a red star on the character's forehead, and was successful only after turning Amazona into a fake political statement, \\"Octobriana: the spirit of the October Revolution\\". Major inconsistencies in his story, and a frame in his book where Octobriana is referred to as \\"Amazona\\" (p. 83), lend credence to this story. In addition, Burian and Koneƒçn√Ω sued Sadeck√Ω in a West German court, winning the case but never recovering all their stolen artwork. As Octobriana is still widely believed to be the product of dissident cells within the U.S.S.R., she is not copyrighted, and has appeared in a variety of artistic incarnations.

The College provides education for approximately 2 thousand students. Chisholm Catholic College was established in 1989 as a result of the amalgamation of St Mark's College, Bedford, conducted by the Christian Brothers, and St Thomas Aquinas College, Inglewood, conducted by the Dominican Sisters. From 1989 to 2002, the College had two campuses. The senior students were taught at the original St Thomas Aquinas College site in Wood Street and the junior students were taught at the St Mark‚Äôs College site in Beaufort Street. In 2003 the College merged onto one site at Beaufort Street The College is owned by the Catholic Archdiocese of Perth in the person of the Archbishop of Perth. With the other Western Australian Bishops, he has authorised the Catholic Education Commission to determine major policy and to appoint a College Board responsible for the financial administration. The Principal, also appointed by the Archbishop, is accountable to the Director of Catholic Education for the educational administration of the College. Background Catholic secondary education in the Bedford Park region of Perth began in 1936 when the Irish Christian Brothers opened a school for boys in Highgate. In 1941, the Dominican Sisters opened a school for girls in Bedford (St. Peters Primary School Bedford). In 1959, the Christian Brothers opened another school for boys in Bedford (C.B.H.S. Bedford). The three schools flourished for many years, until the declining numbers of Brothers and Sisters and economic pressures moved the two Religious Orders and the Catholic Education Commission of Western Australia to establish a single co-educational school. Chisholm Catholic College opened in February, 1989, with the motto, \\"Grow in Christ\\", and 1287 secondary students. The Christian Brothers' Highgate site was sold, the Dominican Sisters' Bedford site became the Years 11, 12 campus and the Christian Brothers' Bedford site became the Years 8‚àí10 campus. In the years that have elapsed, the College facilities have been upgraded and extended. At the same time, the College has graduated over 6,000 students who are now working in all walks of life. In 2003 after an extensive building programme; the two campuses merged onto the Beaufort Street site. During this time the College had developed and is now established as an institution for secondary education for young adolescents. Students graduating from the College continue their education in tertiary institutions or within the workforce domestically, nationally and internationally. In 2009, the college expanded further, with the inclusion of Year 7's on the campus. New classrooms have been built, as well as a new hospitality wing built in late 2008 and opened in 2009. More recently the College has renovated D-Block which was one of the oldest buildings in the campus, Demolished and rebuilt long standing C Block (now known as the Patricia Rodrigues E-Learning Centre), and also expanding the F-Block, to cater for three new Art Rooms. =Caroline Chisholm= Caroline Chisholm The college is named after 19th-century English humanitarian Caroline Chisholm. Chisholm was known for her charity work with the homeless women on the streets of Sydney and founded homes for over 11,000 people and built a shelter for young homeless girls. She converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism after marrying Captain Archibald Chisholm. 2016 Halloween international controversy Father Greg Skulski, a Chisholm Catholic College priest, sent an email on 31 October 2016 to all 1767 students, warning them of the dangers of embarking on a day that was seen as ‚Äòan abomination to God.‚Äô Skulski warned that people who celebrated the custom would 'open the door to occult' and could also 'reveal Satan'. He propounded that \\"As we look at [Halloween‚Äôs] history, we find that its roots go deep into heathenism, paganism, Satanism and the occult ‚Äî and its modern expression is no better‚Ä¶ Halloween practices can open the door to the occult and can introduce forces into people's lives that they are not equipped to combat‚Ä¶ There is genuine power in the occult, but it is demonic power. Any serious study of biblical demonology will reveal Satan as the power behind false religion, witchcraft, idolatry and the occult.\\" The email was poorly received by parents, students, and people worldwide fairly universally. Skulski discreetly left the school shortly after the news of his email reached newspapers all over the globe. International students International students are welcomed in the college, however, enrolments are only available in years 10, 11 and 12.

It is also known as the i440BX and was released in April 1998. The official part number is 82443BX. Features The 440BX originally supported Slot 1 and later Socket 370 Intel P6-based processors in single and SMP configurations at speeds of up to 1 GHz (and potentially up to 1.4 GHz with certain unsupported modifications, up to 1.7 GHz can be achieved using Front Side Bus speeds higher than 133 MHz and appropriate cooling). Its southbridge counterpart is the PIIX4E. History The Intel 440BX is the third Pentium II chipset released by Intel, succeeding the 440FX and 440LX. With the new 100 MHz front side bus, Pentium II CPUs were able to scale better in performance by reducing the difference between processor clock and bus speed. The previous 66 MHz bus had become a serious bottleneck and dated back to the first Pentium \\"Classic\\" chipsets. The 440BX had two closely related chipset peers; the 440ZX and 440MX. 440MX is a mobile chipset for laptops, although a number of notebooks did use 440BX. 440ZX is a cost-reduced version of 440BX. It has a lower maximum RAM limit resulting from having support for only 2 RAM banks. The 440ZX-66, designed for Intel Celeron processor, is limited to 66 MHz FSB speed.Intel Chipsets Mature Products - Mature 450 and 440 Chipset Families The 440BX became one of Intel's most popular chipsets. Enthusiasts enjoyed its overclockability, with the chipset capable of running the front-side bus at speeds ranging from 66 MHz to well over 133 MHz, in stark contrast to the 440LX's struggle to top 75 MHz. A common overclock involved the pin-40 hack, or using an ABIT BP6 or Asus P2B, and setting the bus speed on a 66 MHz Covington or Mendocino-core Celeron to 100 MHz. The Mendocino-core Celeron 300A became a \\"sweet spot\\" for overclockers, with nearly 100% success rates at reaching 450 MHz on a 100 MHz FSB, allowing it to equate to a much more expensive Pentium II at 450 MHz. Other popular overclocks included the SL2W8-stepping Deschutes-core Pentium II that could often run to 450 MHz at 100 MHz FSB, and the SL35D Katmai-core Pentium III 450 MHz which could frequently manage 600 MHz on a 133 MHz FSB. The later Pentium III Coppermine-core processor was easily overclocked and performed well on 440BX motherboards. Finally, the unsupported Tualatin-core Pentium III could be used with an adapter and various modifications, with varying degrees of success. Ironically, the 440BX offered better performance than several of its successors. The i810 and i820 chipsets were unable to beat the 440BX at the 100 MHz FSB speed. The i820 was plagued with a requirement for high cost RDRAM to reach good performance, along with a string of reliability issues involving an RDRAM-to-SDRAM memory translator hub in designs using that chipset with SDRAM. Unofficially, the 440BX could often be taken to 133 MHz FSB. Enthusiast motherboards, such as the Asus P3B-F and Abit BH6/BF6/BE6 series, were equipped with BIOS options to set the board to this unofficial speed. With a 133 MHz FSB, the 440BX could even match the later i815 chipset, which was designed to accommodate the final Tualatin-core Pentium III. Unfortunately, running a 440BX above 100 MHz FSB resulted in the AGP video card being forced to run on an overclocked AGP bus, as the 440BX only had \\"2/3\\" and \\"1/1\\" bus dividers. Some video cards were tolerant of this, such as various early NVIDIA GeForce cards, but more than a few were unstable with a 35% AGP overclock. The PCI bus was not affected by this problem (there was a \\"1/4\\" bus divider for the PCI bus on the 440BX) so users could use a PCI graphics card in lieu of an AGP one. However, this inflicted a performance penalty on graphical performance since PCI has significantly lower bandwidth throughput than AGP. Still, the later i815 was considered the best Pentium III chipset because it offered a better feature set and very similar performance relative to the 440BX. Not only did the i815 support a proper \\"1/2\\" AGP divider for the 133 MHz FSB clock rate, AGP 4x, and Ultra DMA 100, but the later revisions also directly supported the Tualatin Pentium III. The success of the 440BX chipset has caused various software emulation and virtualization packages to use it as part of their virtual system. VMware and Microsoft Virtual PC present the Intel 440BX chipset virtually to hosted virtual machines, due to its broad compatibility. Limitations This chipset does not support 256Mbit SDRAM, which became more common in the 2002 to 2003 period. The higher end 440GX chipset released in June 1998 that was originally intended for servers and workstations has this support.

Its range includes parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map Description This woody species produces small clusters of hard green fruit that ripen into soft dark purple berries in August‚ÄìSeptember. They have a thick outer layer of flesh and on average contain four seeds. This variety of grape is recognized by the white velvet-like underside of the leaves, and often covers small trees, shrubs, fences and other objects that it grows near.Lynch, Daniel. Native and Naturalized Woody Plants of Austin and the Hill Country. Saint Edward's University, 1981, p. 95. V. mustangensis is dioecious, with only female vines bearing fruit. Culinary use The fruit can be potentially irritating to the skin when picked or eaten, and are mildly unpleasant to eat because of bitterness and high acidity content. The grape has a culinary use as jelly and grape juice, both of which are typically sweetened with sugar so as to be palatable. They can also be baked into cobblers, as some early cookbooks in the region directed. Mustang grapes have also been used to make mustang wine since before the Civil War.C.

Life and career Jane Grant was born Jeanette Cole Grant in Joplin, Missouri, and grew up and went to school in Girard, Kansas. Grant originally trained to be a vocalist. She came to New York City at 16 to pursue singing, but fell into journalism when she joined the staff of The New York Times in the society department. She soon worked her way into the city room as a reporter and became close friends with the critic Alexander Woollcott. As a journalist for the Times (its first full-fledged woman reporter), she covered women's issues, questioning public figures about their views on the status of women and interviewing women who worked in traditionally male professions. She wrote for the Times for 15 years. During World War I Grant, who was also a talented singer and dancer, talked her way onto a troopship to France by joining the entertainment with the YMCA. She joined the American Red Cross and entertained soldiers during shows in Paris and at camps. In France, Woollcott introduced her to the future \\"Vicious Circle\\" members, including Harold Ross. Grant and Ross married in 1920. The \\"Vicious Circle\\" later became the Algonquin Round Table. She returned to the Times after the war. In 1921 Grant joined the Lucy Stone League, which was dedicated, in the manner of Lucy Stone, to helping women keep their maiden names after marriage, as Grant did after her two marriages. In 1950, Grant and 22 former members restarted the Lucy Stone League; its first meeting was on 22 Mar 1950 in New York City. That year Grant won the Census Bureau's agreement that a married woman could use her birth surname as her official or real name in the census. (The New York Times, 10 Apr 1950).Stannard, Una (1977). Mrs Man. GermainBooks, San Francisco. , p. 262. With the backing of Raoul Fleischmann, Grant and Ross established The New Yorker in 1925. As editor, Ross is credited with driving the success of the magazine, however Ross is quoted saying the magazine would not have been a success without Jane's contribution. Grant was chiefly a business and content consultant for the magazine and initially helped to gather investments towards starting the magazine. She brought her friend Janet Flanner into the magazine's coterie of correspondents, commissioning her enduring Letter from Paris column. The feature continues to be published today, although it now includes many other cities. Grant later produced a special overseas issue for the armed forces during World War II. Ross and Grant divorced in 1929 after nine years of marriage. During World War II, Grant wrote for several magazines, including Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and The New Yorker. Grant wrote Confession of a Feminist for American Mercury in 1943. In the essay, she describes the experience of being a feminist, recounting her early career as a woman reporter among men for the Times and exploring discriminatory laws and practices.Grant, Jane. \\"Confession of a Feminist.\\" The American Mercury, vol. LVII, no. 240, Dec., 1943, pp. 684-691. Grant continued to be active in feminist causes, reactivating the Lucy Stone League and expanding its purpose. She continued to work for the rights of women into the 1960s, advocating for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and serving on the National Council of Women. In 1939, she married William B. Harris, the editor of Fortune magazine. She and Harris moved from Manhattan to Litchfield, Connecticut. The couple founded White Flower Farm out of a barn on their property. In the 1950s, they started a successful mail-order business for home gardening. In 1968, Grant published a memoir about her life entitled Ross, The New Yorker and Me (Reynal and Co., 1968 New York City). She was encouraged to do so by her second husband, William Harris, and ultimately dedicated the book to him. Grant died in 1972 on the Connecticut farm she shared with her husband. Harris sold the nursery to its current owner, Eliot Wadsworth, in 1976. =Legacy= In 1974, Harris was approached for an endowment by the University of Oregon. After a visit to the school, he agreed to fund a center that engaged in research on women and gender studies. In 1976, Harris donated Jane Grant's papers to the university. Upon his death in 1981, he left a $3.5 million bequest in his wife's name to establish the Center for the Study of Women in Society.

It is a primary resource for information, issues, and ideas about intentional communities in North America - from urban co-ops to cohousing groups to ecovillages to rural communes. Articles and columns cover practical \\"how-to\\" issues of community living as well as personal stories about forming new communities, decision-making, conflict resolution, raising children in community, and sustainability. History and profile The magazine was started in 1972, first under the name Communitas and then (after two issues) as Communities. A variety of editing and publishing collectives, based in several different intentional communities, managed the magazine through its next 78 issues, until the end of 1990, when financial difficulties led to a hiatus in publication. The Fellowship for Intentional Community, based in Rutledge, Missouri, became publisher and resumed publication of Communities two years later. The magazine then returned to a consistent quarterly schedule, with the first issue of 2016 being issue #170. Its editor during 1993-2007 was Diana Leafe Christian; following two issues produced by interim editor Alyson Ewald, Chris Roth then became editor in 2008. Other current staff members include Yulia Zarubina (Art Director) and Christopher Kindig (Business Manager). Articles are written by a wide range of communitarians and people interested in community and/or cooperation, and submissions are welcome from anyone inspired to write. Each quarterly issue focuses on a specific theme. In 2014 the magazine started publishing in digital as well as print form; made available all of its back issues in digital form; and also published 15 Best of Communities collections, each featuring a specific topic in community living.

Satyabhama is described to be an avatar of Bhudevi, the Goddess of Earth. She aided Krishna in defeating the demon Narakasura. Marriage and Children Marriage of Satyabhama Satyabhama was the daughter of Yadava King Satrajit, the royal treasurer of Dwaraka, who was the owner of the Syamantaka jewel. Satrajit, who secured the jewel from the sun-god Surya and would not part with it even when Krishna, the king of Dwarka, asked for it saying it would be safe with him. Shortly thereafter, Prasena, the brother of Satrajit went out hunting wearing the jewel but was killed by a lion. Jambavan, known for his role in the Ramayana, killed the lion and gave the jewel to his daughter Jambavati. When Prasena did not return, Satrajit falsely accused Krishna of killing Prasena for the sake of the jewel. Krishna, in order to remove the stain on his reputation, set out with his men in search of the jewel and found it in Jambavan's cave, with his daughter. Jambavan attacked Krishna thinking him to be an intruder who had come to take away the jewel. They fought each other for 28 days, when Jambavan, whose whole body was terribly weakened from the incisions of Krishna's sword, finally recognised him as Rama and surrendered to the lord. As repentance for his having fought Krishna, Jambavan gave Krishna the jewel and also his daughter Jambavati in marriage. Krishna returned the jewel to Satrajit, who in turn apologized for his false accusation. He promptly offered to give Krishna the jewel and his daughter Satyabhama, in marriage. Krishna accepted them but refused the jewel. Satyabhama, with Krishna, had 10 sons - Bhanu, Swabhanu, Subhanu, Bhanumaan, Prabhanu, Atibhanu, Pratibhanu, Shribhanu, Bruhadbhanu, and Chandrabhanu.https://iskcondwarka.org/blog/krishna-facts-80-sons-lord-krishna/ As per the Harivamsa, she also had daughters, and her eldest son Bhanu was married to Yudhishthira and Draupadi's daughter Suthanu. Killing Of Narakasura Krishna and Satyabhama fighting Narakasura's Akshauhini -Painting from the Metropolitan Museum Narakasura was a Danava tyrant, who captured and governed the city of Pragjothishya, the present day Assam. He gained a boon from Brahma that he would die only in the hands of his mother. Armed with the boon, he ruled like a despot. Narakasura was infamous for his wicked ruling and high disregard for demigods and women. His mother was the earth goddess, Bhoomi Devi. Also, his mother had obtained a boon from Vishnu that her son should die only when she wishes for. Addicted to power, he defeated Lord Indra and abducted 16,000 women and imprisoned them in his palace. He stole the earrings of Aditi, the heavenly mother goddess and usurped some of her territories. Upon this the king of the gods Indra requested Sri Krishna to conquer and kill the demon and free Devlok from his atrocities. On his request, Krishna sieged the city of Narkasura with the assistance of his vehicle, Garuda along with his beloved wife Satyabhama. A terrible battle ensued between Sri Krishna and Narkasura. The demon on several occasions proved a match for Krishna and nullified several of the missiles which Krishna hurled at him. On one instance, the demon hurled a shakti towards Krishna, which hurt Krishna mildly and fell unconscious(Falsely). This enraged Sathyabhama who in turn shot arrows at Narakasura and both Krishna & Sathyabhama killed him finally. Sathyabhama is the incarnation of Bhoomi Devi during Krishna avatar of Lord Vishnu and therefore the boon granted to Bhoomi Devi was fulfilled. Thereafter, Krishna obtained the stolen ear-rings of the mother of the gods, Aditi. Aditi was pleased by Satyabhama's dedication towards her husband and gave her a boon of staying young and beautiful forever. This great day is celebrated as Narak-Chaturdashi which falls in the festival of Diwali (the first important day of Diwali). Lord Krishna's victory on Narakasura translated into freedom for all his prisoners and honoring of Aditi. Having rescued the 16,000 women, Krishna married them to restore them of their honor in society due to being in captivity for a long time. However, the marriage here is only to be viewed as the Lord is more of a savior of these 16,000 women rather than actually marrying them. It is said that Lord Krishna is only married to eight women and that Rukmini, his first wife stands unique in her devotion and love for Krishna. Tulabharam The Tulabharam story is absent in the major scriptures pertaining to Krishna's life. Satyabhama prided herself about the love Krishna had for her and her grasp over his heart. On one contrived occasion, Rishi Narada arrived in Dwarka and in the course of conversation hinted to Satyabhama that the love that Krishna exhibits towards her is not all that real and in fact it is Rukmini(the first wife of Krishna) who has real control over his heart. Unable to bear this, Satyabhama challenged Narada to prove it. Narada, with his way with words, tricked her into accepting a Vrata(ritual) where she has to give Krishna away in charity to Narada and reclaim him by giving the weight of Krishna in wealth. Narada lured her into accepting this vrata by telling her that Krishna‚Äôs love for her will increase many folds if she succeeds in performing this Tulabharam. He also instigated her ego by hinting that her wealth may not be sufficient to equal the weight of Krishna. With Satyabhama's ego duly raised, she told Narada that she can mobilize so much wealth that it is a child‚Äôs play for her to outweigh Krishna. Narada warned her that if she is not able to do this, Krishna will become his slave to be done with as he pleases. The scene was soon set for the vrata. Satyabhama gave Krishna away in charity in spite of the other wives' pleadings. Krishna, always ready to remove ego of his followers, meekly submitted to this drama. After donating Krishna to Narada, Satyabhama arranged for a big scale to be put up and sends with all assurance for her huge treasure of gold and jewelry. All that she had was soon put on the scale, but it didn't budge. Narada started taunting her and threatened her that if she can't put enough gold or diamonds, he will be forced to auction Krishna as a slave to someone else. Satyabhama, in frantic panic, swallowed her pride and begged all the other wives to give their jewels. They agreed out of love for Krishna but alas, it was of no use. Krishna remained a mute witness to all this drama and rubbed salt into the open wounds of Satyabhama's ego that he has now to become a slave to some rishi and will have to suffer the separation from his dear wife. Narada suggested to Satyabhama that Rukmini may be able to get her out of the predicament. She finally swallowed her pride and appealed to the devoted first wife of Krishna. Rukmini came and with a prayer to her husband put a single leaf of the sacred Tulasi on the scale (tula). Lo and behold, the scales became all at once so heavy that even after removing all the jewels, the scales were weighed down on the side of the Tulasi leaf. While there are different versions in different texts as to why the weighing was arranged, the story of the Tulsi leaf placed by Rukmini being worth more in weight than that of Satyabhama's wealth is a common ending. This story is often repeated to enunciate the significance of Tulsi and how a humble offering to God is greater than any material wealth. Goddess Sathyabhama was never proud but to teach the world she acted like that.  In the Mahabharata  Satyabhama and Draupadi discussing about married life Vana Parva, Book 3 of Mahabharata shows the friendship between Satyabhama and Draupadi. Krishna and Satyabhama visits Pandavas and Draupadi at the forest of Kamyaka. When the two women were alone, Satyabhama asks several questions to Draupadi about her married life or 'stridharma'. Draupadi, then, advises her and shares the secrets to a content marriage from her experience. Some of the themes which the two women discuss about are: family, relationships, respect, work, etc. In the Ashwamedha Parva , when Bhima arrived in Dwarka to give the invitation of Ashwamedha to Krishna , Krishna was served by Satyabhama.  End of life  Krishna, Satyabhama and few other dear wives of Krishna entered the woods, resolved to set themselves to the practice of penances. They began to live on fruits and roots and pass their time in the contemplation of Hari. Going beyond the Himavat, they took up their abode in a place called Kalpa.http://www.sacred- texts.com/hin/m16/m16007.htm  Bhama Kalapam  'Bhama Kalapam', is a Kuchipudi dance-drama and narrates the story of Satyabhama. Traditionally, each dancer has to perform this piece at least once in their dancing career. In olden days only men used to perform Kuchipudi. This tradition has now changed now includes female performers. Bhamakalapam is a very beautiful Kuchipudi dance drama containing many beautiful lyrical episodes in its full version. However, in the recent times only Bhama-daruvu is more common.

Dorcas (, Dork√°s; ·π¨abƒ´tƒÅ) was a disciple who lived in Joppa, referenced in the Acts of the Apostles (9:36‚Äì42) in the New Testament. Her name in the Textus Receptus is \\"Œ§Œ±Œ≤ŒπŒ∏Œ¨\\" (Tabitha). Biblical accounts Acts recounts that when she died, she was mourned by \\"all the widows...crying and showing (Peter) the robes and other clothing that she had made while she was still with them\\" (). The Greek construct used in this passage indicates that the widows were the recipients of her charity, but she may also have been a widow herself. It is likely that she was a woman of some means, given her ability to help the poor. The disciples present called upon Peter, who came from nearby Lydda to the place where her body was being laid out for burial, and raised her from the dead. This narrative concerning Tabitha/Dorcas indicates her prominence in the community at Joppa. This might also be indicated by the fact that Peter took the trouble to come to her from a neighbouring city, when requested by the community members. Name The name Dorcas is a Greek translation of the Aramaic name Tabitha, meaning \\"gazelle\\". One species of gazelle is now known as the dorcas gazelle. In Christian tradition Section of Healing of the Cripple and Raising of Tabitha by Masolino da Panicale, 1425. Dorcas Window St. Michael's Parish Church, Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire Basil of Caesarea refers to Dorcas as an example in her Morals (rule 74): \\"That a widow who enjoys sufficiently robust health should spend her life in works of zeal and solicitude, keeping in mind the words of the Apostle and the example of Dorcas.\\" She is also commemorated in poems by Robert Herrick (\\"The Widows' Tears: Or, Dirge of Dorcas\\") and George MacDonald (\\"Dorcas\\"). =Feast= Dorcas, along with Lydia of Thyatira and Phoebe, is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on January 27. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America also places their joint commemoration on January 27, immediately after the male missionaries remembered after the feast of St. Paul's Conversion, but the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (LCMS) commemorates these three faithful women on October 25. The Catholic Church commemorates Dorcas (under the Aramaic version of her name, St Tabitha) on October 25, the same date as the Eastern Church. Dorcas societies, which provide clothing to the poor, are named after her. On October 25 the Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Saint Tabitha the Widow, raised from the dead by the Apostle Peter. In art Depictions of Dorcas in art can be found as early as the fourth century, and her raising is often included in Medieval and Renaissance illustrations of the life of Saint Peter. Dorcas' acts of charity are a common subject of stained glass church windows. She is represented in a window in the apse of Christ Church, Bath, on the south side of St Peter's Church, Caversham, in St. Andrew's Church, Cheddar, in the sacristy of Calvary Episcopal Church (Pittsburgh), in Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff, in St Leonard's Church, Bridgnorth, in Castleton Parish Church in Derbyshire, on the north side of St. Nicholas' church in Castle Hedingham in Essex, in the Ladychapel of St Michael's Church in Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire, in an oriel window at the Head Office of the Retail Trust in north London and in a window in St Andrew's Church in Moretonhampstead. The Lady chapel of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin has a window of Dorcas with the legend: \\"Dorcas this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds\\". Christ Church, St. Joseph, Missouri, depicts her holding a blue cloth in a prominent nave window (1885) on the south side. Grace and Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Richmond, Virginia has her in a window made in Germany around 1890. Dorcas and Cornelius are represented on the stained glass windows above the altar in the Emmanuel Anglican Church in Lawson, New South Wales. In the church of St. Lawrence, Weston under Penyard, Herefordshire, she is depicted with St. Paul in a pair of stained glass windows dedicated to the memory of Edward Burdett Hawkshaw, the Rector from 1854-1912, and his wife, Catherine (a photograph nearby in the church shows that his likeness is the face given to St. Paul, while Dorcas has the face of Mrs. Hawkshaw).

C. M.) Radermacher (1741 ‚Äì 24 December 1783) was a Dutch botanist and author. Radermacher was born in The Hague, Holland. He was an officer of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in Batavia (Jakarta) as well as a talented naturalist. Born into an influential Dutch family, his father was Jacob Cornelis Radermacher (1700-1748), who was treasurer-general to the prince. His uncle and his nephew were members of the Board of Directors of the VOC. In 1757, then only sixteen years old, he had traveled to Indonesian to work as a merchant for the VOC. On 21 May 1761 Jacob married Margaretha Sophia Verijssel. In 1762 Radermacher created a Freemasonic circle in Batavia becoming the first Freemasonic lodge in Asia. In 1763 he returned to Holland to continue his studies, and graduated in law at Harderwijk. After graduation on 13 June 1766 he established himself as a lawyer in Arnhem. After a short time, Radermacher made the decision to return to Batavia. On 20 December 1766 with his wife Margaretha and two sons Frans Reinier and Johannes Cornelis, they boarded the ship Tulpenburg bound for Indonesia. His youngest son, Johannes Cornelis, still an infant, died within one month of their departure. By 1776, Radermacher was promoted by the VOC to title of \\"Extra-Ordinair Council of India\\". During his years in Batavia, Radermacher was a staunch promoter of the arts and sciences in the Far East. On 24 April 1778 he founded the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences (\\"Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en etenschappen\\"). He also donated a substantial amount of writings and collections to start the museum. During this time he also catalogued a significant amount of flora and fauna of the islands of Java and Sumatra. The trees of the genus \\"Radermachera\\" are named for him. By 1781 Radermacher was named Commissioner Concerning the Fleet and the Army, and Common Council of India. After the death of his first wife, he married Bataviase Anna Bosch. For health reasons in 1783, he requested permission to return to Holland. However, while en route home in the Indian Ocean on 24 December, there was a mutiny on board the ship and Radermacher was murdered.

Its central ideas were developed by Danish mathematician Jakob Nielsen, and bear his name. The theory developed in the study of the so-called minimal number of a map f from a compact space to itself, denoted MF[f]. This is defined as: :\\\\mathit{MF}[f] = \\\\min \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\# \\\\mathrm{Fix}(g) \\\\,  \\\\, g \\\\sim f \\\\\\\\}, where ~ indicates homotopy of mappings, and #Fix(g) indicates the number of fixed points of g. The minimal number was very difficult to compute in Nielsen's time, and remains so today. Nielsen's approach is to group the fixed point set into classes, which are judged \\"essential\\" or \\"nonessential\\" according to whether or not they can be \\"removed\\" by a homotopy. Nielsen's original formulation is equivalent to the following: We define an equivalence relation on the set of fixed points of a self-map f on a space X. We say that x is equivalent to y if and only if there exists a path c from x to y with f(c) homotopic to c as paths. The equivalence classes with respect to this relation are called the Nielsen classes of f, and the Nielsen number N(f) is defined as the number of Nielsen classes having non-zero fixed point index sum. Nielsen proved that :N(f) \\\\le \\\\mathit{MF}[f], making his invariant a good tool for estimating the much more difficult MF[f]. This leads immediately to what is now known as the Nielsen fixed point theorem: Any map f has at least N(f) fixed points. Because of its definition in terms of the fixed point index, the Nielsen number is closely related to the Lefschetz number. Indeed, shortly after Nielsen's initial work, the two invariants were combined into a single \\"generalized Lefschetz number\\" (more recently called the Reidemeister trace) by Wecken and Reidemeister.

In the , Cape Tribulation had a population of 118 people.  Geography  The locality is north of Cairns. It is within the Daintree National Park and the Wet Tropics World Heritage area. It is within the local government area of Shire of Douglas (between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Cairns Region). The locality contains a small number of bed and breakfast eco lodges, tourism resorts and backpacker hostels. A few very rare plants can be found on Cape Tribulation. History Kuku Yalanji (also known as Gugu Yalanji, Kuku Yalaja, and Kuku Yelandji) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the Mossman and Daintree areas of North Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Shire of Douglas and Shire of Cook, particularly the localities of Mossman, Daintree, Bloomfield River, China Camp, Maytown, Palmer, Cape Tribulation and Wujal Wujal. Yalanji (also known as Kuku Yalanji, Kuku Yalaja, Kuku Yelandji, and Gugu Yalanji) is an Australian Aboriginal language of Far North Queensland. The traditional language region is Mossman River in the south to the Annan River in the north, bordered by the Pacific Ocean in the east and extending inland to west of Mount Mulgrave. This includes the local government boundaries of the Shire of Douglas, the Shire of Cook and the Aboriginal Shire of Wujal Wujal and the towns and localities of Cooktown, Mossman, Daintree, Cape Tribulation and Wujal Wujal. It includes the head of the Palmer River, the Bloomfield River, China Camp, Maytown, and Palmerville. Cape Tribulation was named by British navigator Lieutenant James Cook on 10 June 1770 (log date) after his ship scraped a reef north east of the cape, whilst passing over it, at 6pm. Cook steered away from the coast into deeper water but at 10.30pm the ship ran aground, on what is now named Endeavour Reef. The ship stuck fast and was badly damaged, desperate measures being needed to prevent it foundering until it was refloated the next day. Cook recorded \\"...the north point [was named] Cape Tribulation because \\"here begun all our troubles\\". In the 1930s some European settlers started arriving in Cape Tribulation, but they found the rainforest environment an extremely challenging one within which to establish a settlement. Various ventures such as fruit and vegetable farming, fishing, cattle, and timber cutting were started and abandoned over the years, and having weekly barges as the only transport in and out was another limitation. In the 1960s a rough track was bulldozed and the first vehicle access created, although the road remained a four-wheel drive track until the early 1990s. In 2002, the road was finally sealed all the way to Cape Tribulation and in early 2011 the last bridge was built creating year round all weather access to Cape Tribulation for the first time. =Protests= In 1983, Cape Tribulation became widely known because of the blockade on the Bloomfield Track. Local government had decided to bulldoze a road through the rainforest north of Cape Tribulation to complete the coastal road to Cooktown. Protesters tried to stop the bulldozers and occupied trees to prevent their destruction. While wild scenes with a large police and media presence ensued at the southern end, the road was completed in three short weeks as the road builders approached from northern end and flanked the protestors. By now the state and federal governments had started to realise the value of this ancient rainforest and despite protests from the local council the forests surrounding Cape Tribulation were given World Heritage Listing in 1988. Climate Mount Sorrow, viewed from the main highway. The average annual rainfall for Cape Tribulation is 3,900 mm.

Previously existing groups include a Flute orchestra, Falkner's consort (a recorder group), Training orchestra and Senior orchestra (now combined), and Junior chamber strings. Each musical group takes part in the Autumn and Spring concerts, though the Senior choir and A Capella do not take part in the latter in order to prepare for the joint choral concert. In addition, A Cappella ‚Äì an auditioned SATB choir ‚Äì takes part in two evensongs each year as well as performing a major work near the February half-term. Previous works have included Handel's Messiah and Faur√©'s Requiem. The joint choral concert takes place in May, often in Salisbury Cathedral or Salisbury's City Hall and is a performance by Senior Choir, A Capella, and the Bishop Wordsworth's Choir. There are performances by each individual group, and a few major works by the combined choir. In previous years this has included Haydn's 'Insanae et vanae curae', Handel‚Äôs 'Zadok the Priest' and a medley of songs from Les Miserables.

Films may have different types of perforations depending on film gauge, film format, and intended usage. Perforations are also used as a standard measuring reference within certain camera systems to refer to the size of the frame. Some formats are referred to in terms of the ratio \\"perforations per frame/gauge size\\" to provide an easy way of denoting size. For instance, 35mm Academy is also known as 4 perf-35mm; VistaVision is 8 perf-35mm; the long-time standard Todd-AO 70 mm film is 5 perf-70mm; and IMAX is 15 perf-70mm. This description does not indicate whether the film transport is horizontal or vertical, but uncertainty is precluded because there are currently no horizontal systems using the same number of perforations on the same gauge as a vertical one. Pitch One of the characteristics of perforations is their \\"pitch\\". This is the measurement of the distance between the tops of two sequential perforations. For motion picture 35 mm film and 16 mm film, there are two different pitches‚Äîshort pitch (camera stocks intended for duplication or printing, and for most intermediate applications) and long pitch (camera stocks intended for direct projection, print stocks, and special intermediate applications). For 35 mm film these are 0.1866\\" and 0.1870\\" (4.740 mm and 4.750 mm); for 16 mm film they are 0.2994\\" and 0.3000\\" (7.605 mm and 7.620 mm). This distinction arose because early nitrocellulose film base naturally shrank about 0.3% in processing due to heat, so film printing equipment was designed to account for a size difference between its (processed) input and (unprocessed) output. When cellulose acetate film was developed, which does not shrink, two forms were produced for compatibility with existing equipment. Shapes The shapes and dimensions of 35 mm sprocket holes Additionally, for 35 mm film only, there are several different shapes for these perforations. =BH= BH (Bell and Howell) perforations are used on camera negative film and have straight tops and bottoms with outward curving sides; they have been in use since the beginning of the 20th century. The BH perforation is a circle of approximately diameter 0.110\\" (2.79 mm), with flattened sides giving a height of approximately 0.073\\" (1.85 mm). The corners used to be sharp, but were slightly rounded in 1989 by 0.005\\" (0.127 mm) to give them greater strength. The BH1866 perforation, or BH perforation with a pitch of 0.1866\\", is the modern standard for negative and intermediate (interpositive / internegative) lab film. The BH1870 perforation, or BH perforation with a pitch of 0.1870\\", was the original standard for positive prints intended for direct projection (release prints). =KS= KS (Kodak Standard) perforations were introduced in the 1920s to improve the life of projected film stock by eliminating the sharp corners which were prone to tearing. and thus are occasionally used for high-speed filming, but failed to displace BH perforations for filming operations prior to projection. KS perfs are rectangular with rounded corners, and measure 0.0780\\" (1.981 mm) in height by 0.1100\\" (2.794 mm) in width.ANSI/SMPTE 139-1996. SMPTE STANDARD for Motion- Picture Film (35mm) ‚Äì Perforated KS. Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. White Plains, NY. KS perforations were once recommended for negative and intermediate films, too, but only the Eastern Bloc countries (the Soviet Union and its satellites) adopted KS for these uses. The Western Bloc countries maintained BH perforations for negative and intermediate films, but adopted KS perforations for positive print films and for amateur films which were on a 35 mm wide base. This was one of the very few instances where a Western Bloc recommendation and standard was adopted by the Eastern Bloc, but was wholly rejected by the very bloc which proposed its adoption. To this day, all Western Bloc professional cameras employ BH perforations, and so also do the intermediate applications (interpositives and internegatives, also known as the IP/IN process). One aspect of this particular adoption was that it effectively prevented amateur camera films from being \\"diverted\\" to professional uses, as KS-perforated camera film will indeed pass undamaged through a Western Bloc professional camera, but it cannot maintain the required registration accuracy as the KS perforation is too tall relative to the professional camera's BH-sized registration pin(s). The increased height also means that the image registration was considerably less accurate than with BH perfs, which remain the standard for negatives.ScreenSound Australia, \\"Technical Glossary of Common Audiovisual Terms: Perforations\\". Retrieved August 11, 2006. The KS1870 perforation, or KS perforation with a pitch of 0.1870\\", is the modern standard for release prints as well as for 135 still camera film. 65/70 mm, the other \\"professional\\" standard, was created many years after KS perforations had been recommended for negative as well as positive applications, and was adopted for positive applications. Consequently, 65/70 mm uses only KS perforations for all applications, negative, intermediate and positive. =DH= The Dubray Howell (DH) perforation was first suggested in 1931 to replace both the BH and KS perfs with a single standard perforation which was a hybrid of the two in shape and size, being like KS a rectangle with rounded corners and a width of 0.1100\\" (2.79 mm), but with BH's height of 0.073\\" (1.85 mm).Hart, Douglas C. The Camera Assistant: A Complete Professional Handbook. Focal Press: Boston, 1996. This gave it longer projection life and also improved registration. One of its primary applications was usage in Technicolor's dye imbibition printing (dye transfer).Gray, Peter. \\"Sprocket Holes\\". Retrieved August 11, 2006. The DH perf never caught on, and Kodak's introduction of monopack Eastmancolor film in the 1950s reduced the demand for dye transfer, although the DH perf persists in intermediate films to this day, such as long-pitch interpositives contact-printed from short-pitch negatives. =CS= In 1953, the introduction of CinemaScope‚Äîwith its wider picture area and its use of four-track magnetic sound (four strips of magnetic tape coated on the film)‚Äîrequired another type of perforation. CinemaScope perforations are similar to KS perforations, but almost square in shape to accommodate the magnetic stripes.Kodak Motion Picture Film (H1) (4th ed). Eastman Kodak Company. These perfs are commonly referred to as CinemaScope (CS) or \\"Fox hole\\" perforations, or simply \\"Foxholes\\" (because, initially, all CinemaScope films were made by 20th Century Fox). Their dimensions are 0.0730\\" (1.85 mm) in width by 0.0780\\" (1.98 mm) in height. ANSI/SMPTE 102-1997. SMPTE Standard for Motion-Picture Film (35mm) ‚Äì Perforated CS-1870. Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. White Plains, NY. Due to the size difference, CS perfed film cannot be run through a projector with standard KS sprocket teeth, but KS prints can be run on sprockets with CS teeth. CS-perforated stock has fallen out of use since the 1970s when 35 mm prints with magnetic sound became uncommon. 17.5 mm Standard 17.5 mm magnetic film uses 35 mm magnetic film which has been slit lengthwise into two equal widths and lengths before use. The \\"heads\\" of one-half of the 35 mm donor become the \\"heads\\" of one 17.5 mm length while the \\"tails\\" of one-half of the 35 mm donor become the \\"heads\\" of the other 17.5 mm length. 17.5 mm magnetic film was used as a secondary \\"shop standard\\" at Paramount and Universal for location dialogue recording ; it was most often run at 45 feet/minute, one-half of the usual 35 mm magnetic film speed, thereby achieving a 4-to-1 increase in economy although at a significant sacrifice in sound fidelity, but adequate for monophonic dialogue. For stereophonic dialogue, conventional 35 mm magnetic film was used. For final mixing, the 17.5 mm dialog was usually initially copied to a 35 mm center track or full coat magnetic film element, whereby the dialog track entered the conventional mixing process as a second-generation 35 mm duplicate. 17.5 mm film, in this context, is for magnetic sound elements only, and only for very cost-conscious producers. 16 mm All 16 mm perforations are rectangles with rounded corners and are 0.0500\\" (1.27mm) high by 0.078\\" (1.9812mm) wide. The tolerance for these perforation dimensions was reduced to 0.01 mm in 1989, which allowed 16 mm camera manufacturers to slightly enlarge their registration pins and thus improve image registration and steadiness tolerances to less than 1/750th of the image height of the 16 mm frame. 8 mm Standard 8 mm film uses 16 mm film that is perforated twice as frequently (half the pitch of normal 16 mm) and then split down the middle after development. Super 8 uses much narrower perfs on film which is already 8 mm wide. Super 8 pitch is 0.1667\\" and perfs are 0.045\\" high by 0.036\\" wide. Placement All of the systems described above place the perforations down either one side (Standard and Super 8, Super 16) or both sides (35 mm and 65/70 mm). Standard 16 mm can be either single or double perf; some older cameras require double perf, but most can handle either. Because most cameras can handle both, and because of the increased popularity of Super 16 film, most 16 mm stock manufactured today is single perf unless requested otherwise. Some obsolete formats such as 9.5 mm film and some variants of 17.5 mm film used a single perforation in the middle of the frame line between each image. This is however considered a liability, since any sprocket or claw error will likely damage the center of the frame itself rather than the outer edges. Damage and inspection Damaged or broken perforations can lead to a tear in the film as it runs through the projector. Film is commonly checked for broken sprocket holes before presentation, a process known as \\"spooling\\". Mechanical devices exist for this purpose, but the classic method is to place the finger and thumb of a gloved hand on the edges of the film, which is mounted on a winding bench, and to slowly run the film through the fingers, feeling for snags.FilmForever description of inspection process See also *List of film formats *Negative pulldown *Super 35  References  Category:Film and video technology pl:Perforacja ","title":"Film perforations"},{"id":"3603107","text":"Darrell Eastlake (11 July 1942 ‚Äì 19 April 2018) was an Australian radio and television presenter, commentator and sports journalist, best known for his long association with the Nine Network.

Background Field Marshal Lennart Torstenson had unexpectedly marched into Jutland in September 1643 (see Torstenson War). While engaged in operations there, an Imperial army under the command of Count Matthias Gallas ventured north towards Jutland to trap the Swedish army there and destroy it. The Emperor had received requests from Denmark for help, as well as assurance that the Swedish forces were wore down and therefore a fairly easy target.Englund 2003, p. 340. However, since Torstenson thought of Gallas' approaching army of about 15,000 men as a threat to the important Swedish strongholds on the German Baltic coast, he turned his army around and headed south to engage the enemy.Englund 2003, p. 340 and 375. Gallas had his troops build and stay behind abatises and entrenchments south of the river Eider in Holstein in an attempt to trap the Swedish forces on Jutland. This tactic failed, as Torstenson's troops outmanoeuvred the enemy by overthrowing a few Imperial positions and pose a threat both to Gallas' back, and Imperial areas further south. The Imperial army began to move south. During the summer of 1644, Torstenson's forces tried to engage the retreating enemy, and in late September, they had once more caught up with the Imperial army. Gallas responded by ordering his troops to build strong defensive positions and await wished-for reinforcement. The Imperial halting-place, south of Magdeburg, was soon surrounded by the Swedish, who cut off all supplies for Gallas' men. Eventually, the Imperial side ran out of bread and they started to lose people to sickness and starvation. As huge numbers of people and animals died, Gallas saw no other solution but to abandon many of the sick, most of his artillery as well as the baggage, and search protection for his troops in Magdeburg itself. The pattern repeated itself when the Swedish forces managed to enclose the city and cut off the supply. One night, the Imperial cavalry made an attempt to break out.Englund 2003, p. 375-376. The battle The Imperial cavalry were caught close to the town of J√ºterbog. They were almost wiped out. Out of an initial force of 4,000 soldiers, only a couple of hundred are said to have managed to get away. The Swedish also captured 3,500 horses.Englund 2003, p. 376. Aftermath It took a while for the Imperial forces in Magdeburg to succeed with a breakaway. Before they did, they had to turn to eating both cats and dogs as their situation grew more desperate. Many of them deserted. Most of the soldiers who aimed to switch sides and join the Swedish forces were judged to be too weak and were therefore ignored by the Swedish.Englund 2003, p. 376-377. After getting some help from drift ice that ruined Swedish bridges on river Elbe, Gallas commanded his troops to make a desperate effort to break out of the Swedish encirclement. They managed to escape to Bohemia in the south east. Out of 12,000 Imperial soldiers that constituted Gallas' army in the summer of 1644, about 2,000 men survived. As a result of the severe fiasco the campaign turned out to be, and the tactical mistakes he made, Gallas was relieved from his duty as Imperial commander.Englund 2003, p. 377.

Life Wold was born into a religious family, the son of Erling Henry Wold Sr, a Lutheran minister and Margaret Barth Wold, an author of inspirational books and plays. He was given piano lessons at an early age but showed little interest in music until his teen years, when he became infatuated, teaching himself to play a variety of instruments and embracing the music of many of the modernist composers. It was also at this point that he started to write music. He first studied composition at Occidental College with Robert Gross where he was awarded the Elinor Remick Warren Composition Award in 1978. Later teachers included Gerard Grisey, Andrew Imbrie and John Chowning at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University, where he primarily studied computer music, gaining a facility with the mathematics of signal processing. While at Berkeley, he married Lynn Murdock, for whom he wrote a number of his early works. In 1985, they had a son, Duncan Renaldo Wold.Interview on usoperaweb, Spring 2003aworks blog He married the painter Lynne Rutter in 2010.http://markalburger2010.blogspot.com/2010/05/may-22-together.html After earning his doctorate at Berkeley in 1987, he went to work for Yamaha Music Technologies, writing a number of patents in music synthesis and processing. During this period, most of his music was electronic, and he was an early advocate of the Synclavier. His work at this time with a number of San Francisco performance artists and dancers led to his continuing interest in theater. After leaving Yamaha in 1992, he cofounded Muscle Fish, an audio and music software company. By 1995 he had migrated back to writing instrumental music and wrote his first chamber opera based on Max Ernst's collage novel A Little Girl Dreams of Taking the Veil, a critical and popular success which has been revived several times, including performances by the Paul Dresher Ensemble and by the Klagenfurter ensemble in Austria and Germany. The success of the production led to a residency at ODC Theater in San Francisco, where he premiered his opera Queer based on William S. Burroughs' early autobiographical novel of the same name in 2001 and Sub Pontio Pilato, an historical fantasy on the death and remembrance of Pontius Pilate in 2003. There have been few purely musical works during this period, but some notable exceptions are Close, played by Rel√¢che and others, the piano pieces Albrechts Fluegel, premiered by Finnish pianist Marja Mutru, and Veracity.Retrospective archived on official website Although he rejected religion in his teens, he has returned many times to religious themes in his works, including many of his operatic works, and his Mass named for Notker the Stammerer commissioned by the Cathedral of St Gall. His earliest music was atonal and arrhythmic, but the influences of just intonation and the music of the minimalists led to the bulk of his music being composed in a variety of tonal genres. He was attracted by the theater and much of his music is either directly dramatic or is based on dramatic rather than purely musical structures.21st Century Music, September 2001, p. 1 Wold is an eclectic composer who has also been called \\"the Eric Satie of Berkeley surrealist/minimalist electro-art rock\\" by the Village Voice.Village Voice, August 6, 1991 (Vol. XXXVI No. 32, p. 77) He composed the soundtracks for a number of films by the independent film director Jon Jost.Sure Fire , Jon Jost websiteThe Bed You Sleep In , Jon Jost websiteLa Lunga Ombra , Jon Jost website There are a number of CD and DVD releases of Wold's music.

Standing and 42 stories tall, the building has a floor area of and it surpassed the Milwaukee City Hall as the tallest building in both the city and the state. Topped off August 29, 1972, and completed in 1973, it was the headquarters for what eventually became Firstar Corporation from 1973 to 2001. The building was designed by Colombian-Peruvian architect Bruce Graham with James DeStefano of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, and engineered by Bangladeshi-American structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan. , the building is home to the headquarters of Foley & Lardner, Robert W. Baird & Company, Sensient Technologies Corporation, and is the Milwaukee office for U.S. Bank, IBM, and CBRE. History Plans were initially announced by First Wisconsin National Bank to construct a new headquarters building on August 21, 1969. Although no architectural designs were complete at the time of its announcement, bank officials indicated it would rise at least 40 stories. On March 18, 1971, bank officials unveiled the final design as a 42-story, skyscraper, encompassing a full block fronting on East Wisconsin Avenue. Designed by James DeStefano of the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, with Fitzhugh Scott Architects of Milwaukee serving as an associate planner for the project, the name of the tower was announced as the First Wisconsin Center. The building was topped-out on August 29, 1972, with the installing of the final steel beam atop the tower. Along with bank officials, mayor Henry Maier, county executive John Doyne, and Wisconsin governor Patrick Lucey attended the ceremony. Near the end of construction in 1973, two fatalities occurred at the work site. In May, a foreman died after being struck by a dump truck. In July, one worker died and four others were injured when a derrick used in installing a aluminum panel broke free and fell 41 floors to the ground. The building was initially occupied on September 4, 1973, and celebrated its official opening on October 6, 1973. =First Wisconsin Center= While still under construction in September 1972, a group of local developers responsible for the neighboring Juneau Square development filed suit against First Wisconsin. The $138 million suit alleged the bank acted in a \\"monopolistic\\" manner to control office development, in an effort to derail the plaintiffs proposed 25-story office tower project on a property adjacent to the First Wisconsin Center. After several years of litigation, the suit finally went to trial in May 1976. The following October, the court found First Wisconsin guilty and awarded the plaintiffs $6 million in damages that was then tripled to $18 million due to federal laws on damages awarded to antitrust suits. First Wisconsin appealed the ruling, and in August 1977, a federal court ruled the case be retried due to the complexity of the original trial, along with the plaintiffs being allowed more time and the admission of hearsay testimony. Upon appeal, in June 1978 the court ruled in favor of First Wisconsin in clearing the company of all charges. After remaining under the ownership of First Wisconsin since its opening, in June 1987 it was announced the tower would be purchased for $195 million by the Dallas development company Trammell Crow. At the time of the announced sale, Trammell Crow unveiled plans to construct a 50-story tower southeast of the First Wisconsin Center in overtaking it as the state's tallest building. It has since remained unbuilt. The sale was completed in January 1988 with Trammell Crow paying $195 million for the complex, only to subsequently sell it to an investment partnership for $220.9 million. =Firstar Center= In December 1988, First Wisconsin changed its name to Firstar Corporation as its operations expanded beyond the state of Wisconsin. In May 1992 the First Wisconsin brand was dropped and all retail banking operations were unified under the name Firstar Bank. As a result, on September 14, 1992, the building was renamed the Firstar Center. In 1996, a $1.2 million skywalk was constructed over Van Buren Street to connect the tower with the neighboring Lewis Center. The addition was funded in part by the city of Milwaukee as an economic development project as Firstar had significant operations in both the tower and neighboring Lewis Center. In 1998, the ownership partnership of The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) decided to place the center on the market. The following November Star Banc Corporation of Cincinnati announced the re-purchase of the tower into company hands for $200 million at the time of their purchase of Firstar. =U.S. Bank Center= In October 2000, Firstar Corporation announced its purchase of U.S. Bancorp and stated the new company would take the U.S. Bank moniker. The Firstar-U.S. Bancorp merger was approved in February 2001, and on May 3, 2002, the Firstar Center became the U.S. Bank Center when the rebranding was completed in Wisconsin. In April 2008, a panel in the Center's adjacent parking garage fell and crushed a car. As a result of this incident, the building owners decided to tear down the garage constructed in 1973 and replace it with a six-story, precast concrete garage. The 1,000 parking space garage opened in June 2010. The windows on the U.S. Bank Center are sometimes used to display lighted messages, during significant events in Milwaukee. In 2003, the letters \\"HD\\", for Harley Davidson, were displayed during HarleyFest to signify their 100th anniversary. In 2005, the letters \\"UWM\\", for University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, were displayed during their Milwaukee Panthers men's basketball team's Sweet Sixteen run in the 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The visible trusses at the top of the building near the U.S. Bank sign are also sometimes lit in germane colors to signify events such as holidays. In the week leading up to the 2007-08 NFC Championship Game they were lit in green and yellow in tribute to the Green Bay Packers. This was done again during the week leading up to the Packers appearance against the Chicago Bears in the 2010 NFC Championship Game on January 16, 2011 in Chicago, Illinois. Architecture U.S. Bank Center at night (2005). Located on East Wisconsin Avenue in Downtown, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. Bank Center comprises a 42-story, office tower designed by Bruce Graham and James DeStefano of the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The U.S. Bank Center covers a full block, between North Cass and Van Buren Streets, and East Michigan Street and East Wisconsin Avenue. The tower features a steel frame sheathed with a white aluminum and glass facade. Structurally, U.S. Bank Center uses a belt truss system engineered by both Graham and Fazlur Rahman Khan.Khan, p. 182 Using elements similar to those used in one of Khan's prior works (the BHP House, since renamed 140 William Street, in Melbourne, Australia), the three diagonal belt trusses provide for a dramatic contrast with the vertical facade in serving both structural and aesthetic purposes.Khan, p. 183Blanc, p. 222 The U.S. Bank Center's exterior was left unchanged from its completion in 1973, through the 1999 merger with Mercantile Bancorporation. At that time, Firstar announced that signs would be attached to the top of the building. Critics argued the green advertising signs on all four sides of the building's top story, in place of the original aluminum elements that were subsequently recycled, disrupted the look of the building's signature diagonal trusses. By 2002, the signs were replaced with opaque, white ones to reflect the merger with U.S. Bancorp. In 2013, they were replaced with blue, energy-saving LED signs.. Peregrine falcons In July 1987, a hacking box was installed outside the 41st floor to allow peregrine falcons to nest as part of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Peregrine Falcon Recovery Plan. The plan was initiated in an effort to reintroduce peregrines within Wisconsin as their whole population in the state were killed off due to the widespread use of DDT in agriculture following World War II. The location atop the building was chosen as it created an environment where the birds were less susceptible to disease and their natural predators. One year after the project was initiated, a pair of peregrine chicks were hatched atop the tower. The hatchlings were the first born in the wild within Wisconsin since the 1960s. Since the launch of the program in 1987, 67 falcons have fledged from the hacking box atop the tower. Observation deck The building was constructed with an observation deck on the 41st floor. Visitors were initially allowed to visit it, and it was the site for several years of the New Year's Eve event \\"Firstar Eve\\", though it was closed for all intents and purposes by 1991 because the firm Foley & Lardner did not want members of the public walking through their offices.\\"Why U.S. Bank Center's observation deck closed down.\\" Daykin, Tom. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Sept. 27, 2011. In 2011, the observation deck was again opened to the public during the first Doors Open Milwaukee event, and has remained open subsequent years.US Bank - Doors Open See also *List of tallest buildings in Milwaukee *List of tallest buildings in Wisconsin *List of tallest buildings by U.S. state References Bibliography * * External links * *U.S. Bank Center at the Emporis buildings database Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Milwaukee Category:U.S. Bank buildings Category:Skidmore, Owings & Merrill buildings Category:Office buildings completed in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in Wisconsin Category:Bangladeshi inventions Category:Colombian inventions Category:Peruvian inventions ","title":"U.S. Bank Center (Milwaukee)"},{"id":"3603143","text":"Tim Gossage (born 27 February 1965, in Perth) is an Australian sports commentator and Australian rules football coach based in Perth, Western Australia.

He was born in Hradec Kr√°lov√©, Austria-Hungary, now part of the Czech Republic. Biography and career V√°vra attended universities in Brno and Prague, where he studied architecture. During 1929‚Äì30, while still a student, he participated in the making of a handful of documentaries and wrote movie scripts. In 1931, he produced the experimental film Svƒõtlo pronik√° tmou. The first movie he directed was 1937's Panenstv√≠. His 1938 film The Merry Wives was praised in Variety for \\"first-rate direction, a salty yarn and elaborate production effort\\", even though it had undergone certain cuts because it was considered too \\"ribald\\" by American censors. V√°vra was a member of the Communist Party from 1945 to 1989. After the Communists seized power in 1948, V√°vra adapted quickly to the new political climate and produced films praising the current regime and supporting the new, official interpretation of the past. In the 1950s he filmed the \\"Hussite Trilogy\\", one of his most famous works, consisting of Jan Hus (1954), Jan ≈Ωi≈æka (1955) and Against All (1957). In the 1960s, V√°vra made his most celebrated films Zlat√° reneta (1965), Romance for Bugle (1966) and Witchhammer (1969). Romance for Bugle was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Special Silver Prize. In the 1970s V√°vra produced his \\"War Trilogy\\" consisting of semi-documentary movies Dny zrady, Sokolovo and Osvobozen√≠ Prahy, all being heavily influenced by communist propaganda. The film Dny zrady (Days of Betrayal, 1973) was entered into the 8th Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Diploma. In 1979 he was a member of the jury at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. Since the 1950s V√°vra taught film direction at Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague. Among his students were several directors of the \\"Czech New Wave\\". Awards In 2001, he was awarded the Czech Lion for his lifelong contribution to the Czech cinema. In 2004, he received the presidential Medal of Merit (Medaile za z√°sluhy). Criticism V√°vra's critics point to his willingness to accommodate the Communist regime. In a 2003 article (\\"Playing the Villain\\", The Globe and Mail, May 15, 2003) about his documentary film, Hitler and I that he shot in Prague, David Cherniack described the following encounter with his former FAMU Head Professor: Filmography *1931 Svƒõtlo pronik√° tmou *1934 ≈Ωijeme v Praze *1935 Listopad *1936 Three Men in the Snow *1936 Velbloud uchem jehly *1937 Panenstv√≠ *1937 Filosofsk√° historie *1938 Na 100% *1938 Cech panen kutnohorsk√Ωch *1939 Humoreska *1939 Kouzeln√Ω d≈Øm *1939 D√≠vka v modr√©m *1940 Poh√°dka m√°je *1940 Podvod s Rubensem *1940 Pacientka Dr. Hegla *1940 Maskovan√° milenka *1941 Turbina *1942 P≈ôijdu hned *1942 Okouzlen√° *1943 ≈†≈•astnou cestu *1945 Vlast v√≠t√° *1945 Rozina sebranec *1946 Nezbedn√Ω bakal√°≈ô *1946 Cesta k barik√°d√°m *1947 P≈ôedtucha *1948 Krakatit *1949 Nƒõm√° barik√°da *1949 L√°ska *1953 N√°stup *1954 Jan Hus *1955 Jan ≈Ωi≈æka *1957 Proti v≈°em *1958 Obƒçan Brych *1959 Prvn√≠ parta *1960 Srpnov√° nedƒõle *1960 Policejn√≠ hodina *1961 Noƒçn√≠ host *1962 Horouc√≠ srdce *1965 Zlat√° reneta *1967 Romance pro k≈ô√≠dlovku *1968 T≈ôin√°ct√° komnata *1969 Kladivo na ƒçarodƒõjnice *1973 Dny zrady *1974 Sokolovo *1976 Osvobozen√≠ Prahy *1977 P≈ô√≠bƒõh l√°sky a cti *1980 Temn√© slunce *1983 Putov√°n√≠ Jana √Åmose *1984 Komediant *1985 Veronika *1985 Old≈ôich a Bo≈æena *1989 Evropa tanƒçila valƒç√≠k *2003 Moje Praha References External links * * Short biography * DVD Cover of the Malleus Maleficarum * Film clips from the Malleus Maleficarum * Film clips from the Romance for Cornet * Complete filmography Category:1911 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Hradec Kr√°lov√© Category:People from the Kingdom of Bohemia Category:Communist Party of Czechoslovakia politicians Category:Czech film directors Category:Czech screenwriters Category:Film educators Category:Czech centenarians Category:Recipients of Medal of Merit (Czech Republic) ","title":"Otakar V√°vra"},{"id":"3603156","text":"Pedra da G√°vea view from S√£o Conrado.

Later, he gets real friends such as Milla and Victor (Viktor). He also has a housecat named Puzzle (Pussel). In the books Alfie experiences many ordinary everyday events that all kids can easily recognize. In his longing to grow up and be a big boy, Alfie often competes with his father on who can manage these events in the best way. Alfie's father is a nice and positive man. Women appear less frequently in the stories: Alfie has an aunt named Fifi (Fiffi) and a grandmother, but no mother is present. The first book about Alfie, Goodnight, Alfie Atkins (Godnatt, Alfons √Öberg), came out in 1972. There are 24 books in the Alfie series, along with seven other Alfie books for smaller children.

Head moderate; a pair of large praefrontal shields, usually followed by a nearly equally large frontal; beak feebly hooked, tricuspid; alveolar ridge of upper jaw short and rather feeble. Anterior face of fore limbs with moderate, unequal-sized, imbricate scales, which are largest towards the outer side; no enlarged tubercles on the thighs; tail ending in a claw-like horny tubercle.

Females tend to be wider than males and more rounded. Males also have a tail that is much larger than that of the female. The males have a concave plastron while the plastron of a female is flat. Additionally, the female's posterior claws are markedly longer and more curved than those of the male. It is believed that this is to facilitate nest building.Tortoise care. Chelonia.org.

Likewise in captivity, they require a very wide range of foods, not just one type of vegetable. Their diet is principally a range of vegetables and edible leaves, however they also consume meat, snails, eggs and other food types. This serves to supplement their diet. Vegetables alone are not sufficiently varied.CTTC ‚Äì The Elongated Tortoise, Indotestudo elongata by Betsy McCormick. Tortoise.org.

This tropical species does not survive in cold climates. Those exported to Europe and North America for the pet trade usually suffer, and soon die, if they are not given special indoor care. They also require a constant water source, for bathing and drinking. Being reptiles, which cannot control their body temperature internally, they require a varied area in which they can access both sun and shade. This allows them to move around and thus to regulate and maintain their body temperature constant.Elongated Tortoise. reptilesweb.com References Further reading * Blyth, E. 1854 Notices and descriptions of various reptiles, new or little-known.

The oath pledged personal loyalty to Adolf Hitler in place of loyalty to the constitution of the country. Historians view the personal oath of the Third Reich as an important psychological element to obey orders for committing war crimes, atrocities, and genocide. During the Nuremberg trials, many German officers unsuccessfully attempted to use the oath as a defense against charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Background During the Weimar era, the oath of allegiance, sworn by the Reichswehr required soldiers to swear loyalty to the Reich Constitution and its lawful institutions. Following Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in 1933, the military oath changed, the troops now swearing loyalty to people and country. On the day of the death of German President Paul von Hindenburg, the oath was changed again, as part of the Nazification of the country, it was no longer one of allegiance to the Constitution or its institutions, but one of binding loyalty to the F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler himself. Although the popular view is that Hitler drafted the oath himself and imposed it on the military, the oath was the initiative of Defence Minister General Werner von Blomberg and General Walther von Reichenau, the chief of the Ministerial Office. The intention of Blomberg and Reichenau in having the military swear an oath to Hitler was to create a personal special bond between him and the military, which was intended to tie Hitler more tightly towards the military and away from the NSDAP. Years later, Blomberg admitted that he did not think through the full implications of the oath at the time. On August 20, 1934, the cabinet decreed the \\"Law On The Allegiance of Civil Servants and Soldiers of the Armed Forces\\", which superseded the original oaths. The new law decreed that both members of the armed forces and civil servants had to swear an oath of loyalty to Hitler personally.  Previous oaths  = Reichswehr oath = From 1919 until 1935, the Weimar Republic's armed forces were called the Reichswehr (\\"Realm Defence\\") The Original Oath called the came into effect on 14 August 1919, shortly after Reichspr√§sident Friedrich Ebert had signed the Weimar Constitution for the German Reich (the so-called Weimar Republic). The Treaty of Versailles limited the Reichswehr to a total of 100,000 men. From 1919 to December 1933: \\"I swear loyalty to the Reich's constitution and pledge, that I as a courageous soldier always want to protect the German Reich and its legal institutions, (and) be obedient to the Reich President and to my superiors.\\" In January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Reichskanzler and the Enabling Act and Gleichschaltung came in effect, the military oath changed again. From 2 December 1933 to 2 August 1934: \\"I swear by God this holy oath, that I want to ever loyally and sincerely serve my people and fatherland and be prepared as a brave and obedient soldier to risk my life for this oath at any time.\\"Reichsgesetzblatt 14 August 1919, page 1419. After the death of German President Paul von Hindenburg on 2 August 1934, Hitler merged the offices of Reichsprasident and Reichskanzler, and declared himself F√ºhrer and Reichskanzler. War Minister Werner von Blomberg issued a new wording which became known as (Hitler oath). From now on all military personnel swore an oath of allegiance and binding loyalty to Adolf Hitler himself.  F√ºhrer oath  = Wehrmacht oath = On 16 March 1935 the German government renamed the Reichswehr, it became the (defence force) Wehrmacht Oath of Loyalty to Adolf Hitler \\"I swear to God this holy oath that I shall render unconditional obedience to the Leader of the German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler, supreme commander of the armed forces, and that as a brave soldier I shall at all times be prepared to give my life for this oath.\\" When the oath became law in July 1935, civilian officials would swear a similar oath. =Civil servant oath= Public servants Oath to Adolf Hitler \\"I swear: I will be faithful and obedient to the leader of the German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler, to observe the law, and to conscientiously fulfill my official duties, so help me God!\\" Oathtakers then sang both Deutschland √úber Alles and the Nazi anthem Horst-Wessel-Lied.

Pei Wei's dishes are made to order in an open concept kitchen using cooking methods like wok firing. The restaurant offers guest customization that includes vegetarian and gluten-free options. Pei Wei's concept is defined by the restaurant industry as fast casual, offering the convenience of counter service and cashier orders, paired with table service once an order has been placed. Pei Wei also has a designated door in the restaurant for cashiers to service takeout food orders. History Exterior of a Pei Wei Asian Diner in Eden Prairie, Minnesota Mongolian-style chicken with scallions and rice The restaurant chain was created as Pei Wei Asian Diner in 2000 by P. F. Chang's China Bistro (PFCB) to compete in the fast casual restaurant segment with a Pan Asian menu and quick, made-to-order service model, while P. F. Chang's remained in the full-service restaurant segment. The first Pei Wei location opened in Scottsdale in 2000. The first location outside of Arizona, the fourth in the chain, was opened in Dallas, Texas, in December 2001. The company opened its first California location, the sixth in the chain, in Irvine in June 2002. Pei Wei was able to open its 100th location in Little Rock, Arkansas in October 2006. By 2010, the company had 168 locations primarily in California, Texas, Arizona and Florida, with a growing presence in the Northeast and Midwest. P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Inc. was acquired by Centerbridge Partners in July 2012, making P. F. Chang's China Bistro an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Wok Parent L.L.C. Over the years, Pei Wei's dining experience has evolved to feature modern conveniences. In July 2015, the company started a customer loyalty program in which customers accumulate points during each visit that can be used to redeem rewards, including free food. Pei Wei was among the first restaurant chains to accept Apple Pay, rolling out the technology to all locations in August 2015. Customers can place takeout orders online or through the Pei Wei mobile app, launched in the App Store and Google Play in September 2016 to allow customers to find locations, view the menu, order and pay. Pei Wei opened their first college campus location in August 2015 on the campus of Arizona State University. Later that year, Pei Wei opened their 200th location in Richardson, Texas in October 2015. Old Pei Wei logo (2000‚Äì2018) During 2016, Pei Wei withdrew operations in several states, including closing all three of its restaurants in Ohio and all three of its locations in Louisiana. That same year, the company opened five restaurants in Florida, four in Texas and one in Arkansas. Pei Wei undertook an extensive rebranding campaign during the same period. The new brand position, designed to tap into the national dining trend toward more healthful eating, included the rollout of quinoa on its menu, as well as the addition of a salad category and several lighter small plate options. In 2016, the company opened its Pei Wei Test Kitchen restaurant in Scottsdale to develop and test new menu items and gather public feedback in real time. Pei Wei hired restaurant industry veteran John ‚ÄúJ.‚Äù Hedrick as CEO in 2017. Hedrick had previously served as COO of NPC International, the nation's seventh-largest restaurant operator with 1,300 fast food outlets with revenues exceeding $1.2 billion. Interior of a Pei Wei Asian Diner in Gainesville, Virginia At the end of 2017, Pei Wei announced its separation from parent company, P.F. Chang's China Bistro. This separation would lead the company to undergo a slight name change, as well as the relocation of its headquarters from Scottsdale to Irving, Texas. As a part of their separation from P.F. Chang's, Pei Wei undertook a major rebranding campaign by hiring a new creative agency to revitalize the brand by replacing the company's longtime logo with the new tiger logo and to officially change the trading name of the business to Pei Wei Asian Kitchen in February 2018. On June 5, 2019 Pei Wei was sold to PWD Acquisition LLC. International locations In 2011, Pei Wei announced an agreement with Alsea to open franchise locations in Mexico. The first location in Mexico opened in 2012. Due to lower than expected performance, all Mexico City locations were closed by the end of 2014. All three locations were in Mexico City. In August 2012, Pei Wei opened its first location in Kuwait, operated by M.H. Alshaya Co. The same franchisee opened the first location in Dubai, U.A.E. in April 2013. By the end of 2014, Pei Wei had five international locations: two locations in Kuwait, and three in the United Arab Emirates. In September 2016, Pei opened its first East Asian location in South Korea through a partnership with ELX Food & Beverage. The Korean location in Seoul's Starfield Hanam, the country's largest shopping mall, is one of 11 locations that the chain plans to open by the end of 2017.

(Hamburg - South America Steam Shipping Company or Hamburg South America Line) was established by a conglomerate of 11 Hamburg-based merchant houses. Three steam-ships totalling 4,000 GRT provided a monthly shipping service to Brazil and Argentina. By 1914 the company was operating over 50 ships totaling approximately 325,000 GRT. World War I culminated in the loss of all Hamburg S√ºd's vessels, and the company was forced to begin again by chartering vessels. The early 1950s saw the company embark on tramp shipping and tanker shipping, and large growth of refrigerated cargoes. In 1955 the Dr. August Oetker company took the company over, and began rapid expansion of the liner and passenger services. The takeover of Deutsche Levante Linie in 1956 saw the company commence its first foray into the Mediterranean. 1957 saw liner services begin between North America and Australia/New Zealand, with the Columbus New Zealand being the first container ship to ply trade-lanes in the region in 1971, pioneering containerization in the Pacific.  Wartime roles  * The Cap Trafalgar was a brand-new passenger liner, having been completed only on March 1, 1914 and had commenced her maiden voyage only on March 10, 1914. Germany had lightly armed the vessel with two 10.5 cm guns and 6 heavy machine guns, and had removed one of the three steam-funnels and re-coloured the vessel to disguise it as a British liner. The vessel encountered the British fully armed ex-steam liner Carmania about 700 miles east of the Brazilian coast, near the island of Trindade, at 9:30 a.m. on September 14, 1914. After a heated exchange of fire between the two ships, the Cap Trafalgar began listing to the left, then sank bow-first. * The Cap Arcona, arguably one of the most beautiful passenger liners in its time, was converted to serve the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) as a converted transport vessel in 1940. At the end of 1944 it was commandeered as a troopship, primarily transporting refugees and prisoners of war on the Baltic Sea. Loaded with 4,500 prisoners at L√ºbeck Bay, it was attacked and sunk by Royal Air Force Typhoons in an air-raid. It remained capsized in L√ºbeck Bay until 1950 and was then dismantled by divers over a period of several years and scrapped. The wreckage was registered and photographed in detail by Rolls Royce, which had produced the RAF's rockets, to assess their effectiveness.

The species is endemic to Southeast Asia. It is believed to be among the most primitive of living tortoises, based on molecular and morphological studies. Taxonomy There are two recognized subspecies: M. e. emys occurring in southern Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo; and M. e. phayrei, occurring from northwestern Thailand to northeastern India. The latter was named after Sir Arthur Purves Phayre (1812‚Äì1885), British Army officer in India who became Commissioner of British Burma.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Manouria emys phayrei, p. 205). Based on a variety of phylogenetic characteristics, the genus Manouria is regarded as comparatively primitive and basal to other Testudinidae. Description Illustration by George Henry Ford The Asian forest tortoise is the largest tortoise in mainland Asia. The largest adults of the northern subspecies, Manouria emys phayrei, can reach in the wild and much more than that in captivity. The carapace is considerably depressed, its depth not half its length; anterior and posterior margins reverted, more or less strongly serrated; nuchal present; two supracaudal shields; dorsal shields concentrically striated, often concave; vertebrals much broader than long and at least as broad as costals. The plastron is large, gular region somewhat produced and usually notched, hind lobe deeply notched; the pectoral shields may be widely separated from each other, or from a short median suture; axillary shield very small, inguinal large. The head is moderate in size; two large prefrontal shields and a large frontal; beak not hooked; jaws feebly denticulated, the alveolar surface of the upper jaw with a strong median ridge. The forelimbs anteriorly have very large, bony, pointed, imbricate tubercles, forming four or five longitudinal series. The hind limbs have very large bony tubercles on the plantar surface, with others larger, conical, and spur-like on the heel, and a group of still larger conical tubercles on each side on the back of the thighs. Adults are dark brown or blackish. The carapace of juveniles is yellowish brown, with dark-brown markings.Boulenger GA (1890). The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma. Reptilia and Batrachia. London: Secretary of State for India in Council. (Taylor and Francis, printers). xviii + 541 pp. (Testudo emys, p. 22). Carapace from Kaeng Krachan National Park in Thailand. Plastron from Kaeng Krachan National Park in Thailand. Distribution The Asian forest tortoise occurs in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Reproduction Manouria emys is the only tortoise which lays its eggs above ground in a nest, which the female constructs of leaf litter. The female uses both front and rear legs to gather material for the nest and lays up to 50 eggs deep inside it. She then sits on and near the nest to protect it, and will \\"chase\\" predators and intruders away.

Its founding in the mid eighth century would mark seven hundred years of independent Muslim rule in what is now Spain and Portugal. The territories of the Emirate, located in what the Arabs called Al-Andalus, had formed part of the Umayyad Caliphate since the early eighth century. After the caliphate was overthrown by the Abbasids in 750, the Umayyad prince Abd ar- Rahman I fled the former capital of Damascus and established an independent emirate in Iberia in 756. The provincial capital of C√≥rdoba ( ) was made the capital, and within decades grew into one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the world. After initially recognizing the legitimacy of the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad, in 929 Emir Abd ar-Rahman III declared the caliphate of C√≥rdoba, with himself as caliph. History Roderic was a Visigothic emperor who ruled the area of Spain from 710-712 AD, later referred to by the Arabs, as \\"Al-Andalus\\". The Umayyad Empire had previously conducted small raids on the southern tip of Spain against the Visigoths, but full scale conquest did not begin until April of 711, when an army led by Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed the narrow channel that separated southern Spain from North African; the area is today known as Gibraltar, from the Arabic (), meaning \\"mountain of ·π¨ƒÅriq\\". After crossing into Spain, Tariq's troops clashed with Roderic's small army at the banks of the Wadi-Lakku river. Visigothic forces were defeated and Roderic was killed, leaving an open path into Spain, and by extension Europe, for the Umayyad Empire to conquer. After the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in 711‚Äì718, the Iberian Peninsula was established as a province under the Umayyad Caliphate. The rulers of this province established their capital in C√≥rdoba and received from the Umayyad Caliphate the title of wali or emir. In 756, Abd al-Rahman I, a prince of the deposed Umayyad royal family, refused to recognize the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate and became an independent emir of C√≥rdoba. He had been on the run for six years after the Umayyads had lost the position of caliph in Damascus in 750 to the Abbasids. Intent on regaining a position of power, he defeated the existing Muslim rulers of the area who had defied Umayyad rule and united various local fiefdoms into an emirate.Barton, 37. However, this first unification of al-Andalus under Abd al-Rahman still took more than twenty-five years to complete (Toledo, Zaragoza, Pamplona, Barcelona). For the next century and a half, his descendants continued as emirs of C√≥rdoba, with nominal control over the rest of al-Andalus and sometimes even parts of western North Africa, but with real control always in question, particularly over the marches along the Christian border, their power vacillating depending on the competence of the individual emir. For example, the power of emir Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi () did not extend beyond C√≥rdoba itself. Upon the ascent to the throne of Abd al-Rahman III, who came to power in 912, the political decline of the emirate was obvious. Abd al-Rahman III rapidly restored Umayyad power throughout al- Andalus and extended it into western North Africa as well. In 929, to impose his authority and end the riots and conflicts that ravaged the Iberian Peninsula, he proclaimed himself caliph of C√≥rdoba, elevating the emirate to a position of prestige not only in comparison to the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad but also the Shia Fatimid caliph in Tunis, with whom he was competing for control of North Africa. The Emirate of Cordoba gradually lost power and in 1492 Granada was retaken by the Christians and Muslim influence dissolved.Bouchard, Constance Brittain, Chief Consultant.

It is loosely based on the 1992 movie of the same name. Both the European and North American versions are in English. In contrast to the computer/Game Boy and NES versions, this version of the game plays more like an adventure game. It is the only version of the game that allows players to control Jack Deebs, who must avoid the advances of Holli Would and return home. Cool World was first mentioned in issue #47 (April 1993) of the North American video gaming magazine Nintendo Power. Gameplay Players must avoid The Popper Police or risk being arrested. The player controls Jack, who must avoid being surrounded by the Popper Police, a cartoon police force, or get arrested. Depending on how many times the player has broken the law and whether he has collected the in-game currency of nickels or not, the player will either get a lecture by Detective Frank Harris and/or be forced to pay bail money. Ten coins is the usual bail required by Detective Harris. Players can visit Las Vegas to increase their nickel stash and store their coins at the Cool World bank. Other in-game locales include a pawn shop that allows items to be traded or bought with nickels in addition to the Slash Club where the player arranges a date with Holli Would. At Holli Would's house, the player must navigate the exterior of the house in order to reach the date with Holli. If the player did not arrange a date with Holli before reaching the top, Jack is tossed back to the ground level. In the malt shop, candy can be found in addition to other sweets. However, entry is restricted to players who have collected several pieces of candy. Reception Allgame gave Cool World an overall rating of 2 stars out of an overall 5.

When introduced into services, these ships were the most powerful destroyers in the world. They served as first-line destroyers through the 1930s, and remained formidable weapons systems well into the Pacific War. History Construction of the advanced Fubuki-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion program from fiscal 1923, intended to give Japan a qualitative edge with the world's most modern ships.Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare p.1040 The Fubuki class drastically improved upon previous destroyer designs; so much so that they were designated . The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many light cruisers in other navies.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun page 221-222. Ayanami, built at the Fujinagata Shipyards in Osaka was the first in an improved series, which incorporated a modified gun turret which could elevate her main battery of Type 3 127 mm 50 caliber naval guns to 75¬∞ as opposed to the original 40¬∞, thus permitting the guns to be used as dual purpose guns against aircraft. Ayanami was the first destroyer in the world with this ability.F Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare (London: Phoebus, 1977), Volume 10, p.1040. Ayanami was laid down on 20 January 1928, launched on 5 October 1929 and commissioned on 30 April 1930. Originally assigned hull designation ‚ÄúDestroyer No. 45‚Äù, she inherited the name of her predecessor on 1 August before her launch. The 4th Fleet Incident occurred only a year after her commissioning, and Ayanami was quickly taken back to the shipyards for strengthening of her hull. Operational history On completion, Ayanami, along with her sister ships, , , and , were assigned to Destroyer Division 19 under the IJN 2nd Fleet. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, from 1937, Ayanami covered landing of Japanese forces in Shanghai and Hangzhou. From 1940, she was assigned to patrol and covered landings of Japanese forces in south China. =World War II history= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Ayanami was assigned to Destroyer Division 19 of Desron 3 of the IJN 1st Fleet, and had deployed from Kure Naval District to the port of Samah on Hainan Island, escorting Japanese troopships for landing operations in the Battle of Malaya. On 19 December, Ayanami sank the Dutch submarine with assistance from her sister ships Uranami and and rescued 32 survivors.Brown. Warship Losses of World War II Ayanami subsequently was part of the escort for the heavy cruisers , , and in support of \\"Operation L\\" (the invasion of Banka, Palembang and the Anambas Islands in the Netherlands East Indies), taking minor damage after striking a reef in the Anambas, necessitating a return to Camranh Bay, French Indochina for emergency repairs. At the end of February, Ayanami went to the assistance of , which had run aground off Saigon as well. In March, Ayanami was assigned to \\"Operation T\\" (the invasion of northern Sumatra) and \\"Operation D\\", (the invasion of the Andaman Islands). She served patrol and escort duties out of Port Blair during the Japanese raids into the Indian Ocean. On 13‚Äì22 April she returned via Singapore and Camranh Bay to Kure Naval Arsenal, for maintenance. On 4‚Äì5 June, Ayanami participated in the Battle of Midway as part of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto‚Äôs main fleet. Ayanami sailed from Amami-≈åshima to Mako Guard District, Singapore, Sabang and Mergui for a projected second Indian Ocean raid. The operation was cancelled due to the Guadalcanal campaign, and Ayanami was ordered to Truk instead, arriving in late August. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August Ayanami escorted the fleet supply group to Guadalcanal. She was assigned to numerous \\"Tokyo Express\\" transport missions to various locations in the Solomon Islands in October and November.D‚ÄôAlbas. Death of a Navy: Japanese Naval Action in World War II. Ayanami's final mission, on November 14‚Äì15, 1942, was that of the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. There, she was attached to a scouting force under the command of Rear Admiral Shintar≈ç Hashimoto in the light cruiser . When American Admiral Willis A. Lee's Task Force 64 was spotted near Savo Island, Hashimoto took his ships clockwise around the island, but sent Ayanami alone in the opposite direction sweeping for enemy vessels. When Lee's ships were located, the order to attack was given, and as such, Ayanami became one of three prongs in the initial attack (Along with Hashimoto's group, and another group led by Rear Admiral Susumu Kimura in the light cruiser ). Ayanami was first sighted by the American destroyer , but the light cruiser Nagara was located soon after and the four destroyers' attentions shifted to it. Torpedo and shellfire from Ayanami, Nagara, and Uranami sank two of the four destroyers ( and USS Walke), mortally wounded (which was scuttled after the battle), and severely damaged , causing heavy American losses in the first phase of the battle. Lee's then sighted Ayanami and shelled her. The Japanese destroyer sustained critical damage and 27 of her crew were killed; she fired one shell, which missed Washington. Thirty surviving crew members including Commander Sakuma escaped in a boat to Guadalcanal; the remainder were taken off by Uranami. At the same time Washington crippled and sank the battleship . Later in the night Uranami scuttled the abandoned Ayanami with a single torpedo, and she sank soon after 02:00. Her wreck remains at the bottom of Ironbottom Sound.Hammel. Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea. On 12 December 1942, Ayanami was removed from the navy list. The wreck In late July 1992 marine archeologist Robert Ballard led an expedition to Ironbottom Sound, finding thirteen newly discovered shipwrecks. Among these new finds were the remains of Ayanami. They were found southeast of Savo Island at at a depth of approximately . The hull and keel of the ship appear to have been broken by a starboard torpedo blast just behind the bridge; the ship came to rest in two pieces, with the stern upright, and the bow twisted and lying on its starboard side.

Deep Time  Gould ranks the development of the concept \\"deep time,\\" which involved deliberately rejecting the biblical description of earth's past for nearly incomprehensible eons, with the revolutions associated with Copernicus and Charles Darwin. To illustrate this, Gould picked three major figures in the history of geology, one traditional villain (Thomas Burnet) and two traditional heroes (James Hutton and Charles Lyell).  Flimsy 'cardboard'  Standard textbook accounts of the achievements of these three figures have long provided what Gould describes as a \\"self-serving mythology.\\" These flimsy \\"cardboard\\" accounts vaunt the superiority of empiricism and inductivism over the scientific nemesis of religious bigotry. This legend as perpetuated by geology textbooks over the last century claims that geology remained in the service of the Mosaic story of creation so long as armchair geological theorists refused to place fieldwork ahead of scriptural authority. Thomas Burnet was just such an archetypical religious spokesman. A century later, Hutton heroically broke with this biblical zealotry by arguing that geological evidence must rest upon a solid empirical foundation. The Earth's strata, when carefully examined, betray \\"no vestige of a beginning‚Äîno prospect of an end.\\" But Hutton was far ahead of his time. So it was not until Charles Lyell published the Principles of Geology that geologists finally came to accept Hutton's basic message and banished miraculous intervention, catastrophes, and biblical deluges from their science. Having elaborated this bit of scientific melodrama, Gould proceeds to demolish it by showing that the actualities of Hutton's and Lyell's work were the opposite of the textbook legend. His intention is not simply to debunk the textbook legend, which has already been debunked by historians such as Martin J. S. Rudwick. He sets out to rectify the error and show the real sources of inspiration in the development of deep time which have not been properly understood.  Kuhnian revolutions  Gould is deeply influenced by Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962). Kuhn argued, in part, that science is a social activity and that theories are intellectual constructions imposed on data, not demanded by them. Along with Kuhn and other philosophers and sociologists of science, Gould has recognized that mental constructs (metaphors, analogies, personal philosophies, imaginative leaps)‚Äînot empirical discoveries‚Äîare what bring about scientific advance. \\"Facts\\" are so embedded in a paradigm that they simply do not have the kind of independent probative power they were once thought to possess. The development of the idea of deep time is by no means fieldwork, as the textbook myths would have us believe. Rather, Gould pinpoints a powerful pair of metaphors‚Äîtime's arrow and time's cycle‚Äîby which humankind has always tried to grasp the concept of time. Time's arrow captures the uniqueness and distinctive character of sequential events, whereas time's cycle provides these events with another kind of meaning by evoking lawfulness and predictability. More importantly, this metaphorical pair of ideas was essential to the thinking of the three geological protagonists; and the paired concepts therefore offer the key, now obscured by textbook mythology, to unlocking their thinking about time.  Burnet  Burnet's theory is a one- cycle theory in which biblical narrative (time's arrow) runs its course within a wider conception of \\"the great year\\" and \\"great circle of time and fate\\" that bring about the return of Paradise. It is his belief in Scripture that made Burnet a pariah in the history of geology. Yet Burnet was hardly the religious fanatic he is painted to have been within the context of his contemporary scientific thought. In contrast to textbook legend, Burnet was adamant about explaining the Biblical history of the earth entirely within the frame of natural science, devoid of all appeals to miracles or divine intervention. Thus this \\"bad guy\\" of geological textbook history was actually more devoted to rational, miracle-free science than the greatest scientists of his age.  Hutton‚Äôs endless cycles of deep time  Before James Hutton, most geological theorists had dealt only with processes of decay. The earth was created and its geologic structures just wore down through catastrophic events like weathering and especially the biblical Flood. Hutton introduced the concept of repair into geology and, with it, the notion of deep time. The textbook myths see this as a triumph of science and empiricism over religion, but it was nothing of the kind. Hutton's theory of the earth as a geological clockwork of eroding continents balanced against uplifting ocean basins was not based on field observations but on a priori conceptions inspired jointly by religious considerations and \\"the most rigid and uncompromising version of time's cycle ever developed by a geologist.\\" Hutton's theory grew out of what may be called \\"the paradox of the soil.\\" Good soil, the product of the \\"denudation,\\" or eroding, of rock strata, eventually loses its richness to the plant life it sustains. Were there no geological source for continual new soil then the world would bear the intolerable stamp of an imperfectly designed abode for man's existence. Hutton's homocentric and teleological concept of the world therefore demanded that the soil, new soil, should never run out. This requirement in turn demanded the uplift of new strata to become the sources for soil replenishment. So Hutton set out to find evidence for uplift (which he naturally did, since he was looking for it). He found much evidence interpreted to be repeated uplifts of the Earth's crust. This led him inexorably to the idea of deep time. So rigid was Hutton's vision of an endlessly cycling earth having \\"no vestige of a beginning\\" and \\"no prospect of an end\\" that he lost all interest in the historical nature of geological change. The Divine benevolence entailed in these cycles was everything to Hutton. Such is an unlikely hero for empiricist geology, who nevertheless became one. = The mythifying of Hutton = Gould reconstructs the process of mythification of Hutton and sees it as involving several stages. First, Hutton's long and turgid Theory of the Earth (1795) was popularized by his friend John Playfair (1802). Not only did Playfair make up for Hutton's difficult prose, but he also modernized Hutton's theory by soft-pedaling both his \\"denial of biblical history\\" and his repeated appeals to final causes. Subsequently, Charles Lyell, who needed an empiricist hero for his own account of the warfare between science and religious bigotry, bolstered Hutton's image as a fieldworker who had no conceptual bias. Finally the legend was consolidated in the writings of later geologists, who rarely bothered to read Hutton in the original.  Lyell‚Äôs uniformitarianism  It is important to bear in mind that Charles Lyell was trained as a lawyer. His rhetorical skills were considerable and they are crucial to understanding his impact upon the history of geology. When pleading for his favorite client, which became known as the \\"uniformitarian\\" theory of geology, he portrayed the previous history of his discipline as a gradual overcoming of primitive superstitions, wild speculations, and biblical allegiances. In doing so he created his own legend as an arch-empiricist free of all bias and preconception. But Lyell was not selling just evidence and fieldwork over previous dogma and speculative theory. Rather he foisted upon his contemporaries a \\"fascinating and particular theory rooted in‚Ä¶time's cycle\\" by conflating a number of distinct elements under the single banner of \\"uniformitarianism,\\" the regularity of physical laws with the irregularity of history. = The philosophical assumptions = First, Lyell argued for the uniformity of nature's laws (that is, the notion that laws do not change with time or place). Second, he argued for the uniformity of process, which simply means always explaining past changes by currently known causes even if catastrophic interpretations may be just as explanatory. Contrary to legend, Lyell's catastrophic opponents accepted both of these philosophical aspects of \\"uniformity.\\" What Lyell's critics did not accept were two further substantive hypotheses about the world that he included under the heading of good (uniformitarian) science. = The substantive hypotheses = These claims were that rates of geological change are always uniform and gradual and that the general state of the world also remains uniform (that is, there is no progression or directionality in the long run). Far from using Hutton's field data to show that the earth has passed through vast epochs of change, Lyell drew on the peculiarly static spirit of Hutton's vision to conceive an earth that, although unimaginably old, had changed hardly at all. The last of these claims was the most peculiar of all within Lyell's vision of earth history. It led him to deny all evidence of progression in the fossil record and hence to reject not only Lamarck's theory of evolution but also contemporary catastrophist notions, in which \\"higher\\" organisms were thought to replace \\"lower\\" ones after mass extinctions. If fossils seemed to belie this, if mammals were absent from older rocks, it was simply because fossils were rare and scattered. In showing how Hutton and Lyell were dedicated not to modern notions of geological dynamism but to antique ones of geological steady-state, Gould points out that Lyell was even less of an empiricist than most of his catastrophist and creationist opponents. For Lyell was constantly forced to deny the literal evidence of the geological record, which shows whole groups of organisms being abruptly replaced by different sets of organisms in adjacent strata. His gradualist reading of the geological record therefore required his constant \\"interpretation\\" of the recalcitrant evidence in order to reconcile it with his notions of time's stately cycle and a world without abrupt changes. = From steady state to progressionism = Nor was Lyell's eventual conversion to evolution a strictly empirical affair. When he finally took this step publicly, in 1868, it was not because he had been persuaded by Darwin's theory of natural selection. In fact, Lyell rejected that theory, accepting only a general evolutionary process without its celebrated Darwinian mechanism. Admitting nonmiraculous progression (that is, evolution) in turn allowed him to preserve three of his four uniformities (uniformity of law, process, and rate) while giving up only uniformity of state. This was as Gould notes, \\"the most conservative intellectual option available to him.\\" Charles Lyell may have lost the battle over progressionism to Darwinism, but through rhetoric he won a battle against catastrophism, which enabled his hypothesis of the uniformity of rate to become a textbook shibboleth. The catastrophists of Lyell's day, Gould nevertheless maintains, were right all along. The literal fossil evidence of major rapid changes in previous faunas does not need to be interpreted away, as Lyell tried to do by appealing to the imperfection of the geological record. Gould sees supreme irony in the recent hypothesis of the Berkeley scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez that mass extinctions were caused by asteroidal or cometary impacts (a hypothesis now made plausible by the discovery of a worldwide iridium layer deposited at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary); for this is precisely the sort of wild \\"cosmological\\" speculation that Lyell derided in seventeenth-century writers like William Whiston. Gould concludes Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle by insisting that arrows and cycles are \\"eternal metaphors\\" in the understanding of time. In a thoughtful complement to his discussion of the history of geology, he shows how these two metaphors have figured in the art and sculpture associated with major biblical themes. Both metaphors, he concludes, are needed \\"for any comprehensive view of history.\\"  Notes   References  The article is based upon the following book reviews:   Further reading  Additional book reviews include:   External links  * Time‚Äôs Arrow, Time‚Äôs Cycle on-line  Details  * Publisher: Harvard University Press * (Hardback 1987) * (Paperback 1988) * Language: English Category:1987 non-fiction books Category:American non- fiction books Category:Books by Stephen Jay Gould Category:English-language books Category:Harvard University Press books Category:Science books Category:Philosophy of science literature ","title":"Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle"},{"id":"3603335","text":"The French Democracy is a short 2005 French political film made by Alex Chan using computer animation from Lionhead Studios' 2005 business simulation game The Movies. The plot centers on three Moroccan men who turn to rioting after facing different forms of discrimination. Chan, a French native of Chinese descent, created the film to convey his view that racism caused the riots of the 2005 civil unrest in France. Although Chan was restricted by shortcomings and technical limitations in The Movies, he finished the film after four days of production. The film was uploaded to The Movies Online, Lionhead's website for user-created videos, on 22 November 2005 and was soon covered by American and French press. Although real-time-rendered, three-dimensional computer animation (machinima) had been used in earlier political films, The French Democracy attained an unprecedented level of mainstream attention for political machinima. While acknowledging the film's flaws, such as the grammatically poor English subtitles, commentators praised its clear political message and compared it to films such as La Haine and Do the Right Thing. The French Democracy inspired other politically conscious machinima works and fueled discussion about the art form's potential for political expression. Some raised concerns that video game companies would use their copyrights to control the content of derivative machinima films. Synopsis The French Democracy begins with a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event that triggered riots in France: the electrocution of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traor√©. In the film, the youths attempt to hide from police in a building near an electric power station. In a televised speech, the Minister of the Interior vows to increase efforts to fight crime. Three fictional Moroccan men discuss the recent events and disagree with means used by the police, and feel that blacks are unfairly targeted. They face different forms of discrimination: overnight detention for lack of a passport during an identity check, refusal of employment and housing rental, and police brutality. Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of the chaos, and the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traor√©, lamenting the loss of the French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity. Background and production Alex Chan, the creator of The French Democracy, had no previous film-making experience. Alex Chan, 27 years old at the time of the civil unrest, was a French-born freelance industrial designer whose parents were Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong.; ; Although Chan was successful professionally, he felt that there was racial and cultural discrimination in France, based on his own previous attempts to find housing and violence directed towards him. He lived in Seine-Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris, near housing projects where rioting had caused the destruction of cars owned by acquaintances. In the aftermath of the unrest, Chan was dissatisfied, stating that \\"the media, especially in the United States, ... linked what was happening, the riots, to terrorism and put the blame on the Muslim community\\". Chan wanted instead to depict \\"more human\\" rioters who turned to violence in response to racism. According to Chan, the title The French Democracy is meant to be ironic, in that the youths express themselves by rioting rather than through the political system. He elaborated: > [The French Democracy is] a shortcut made with The Movies technology about > the recent events concerning riots in French suburbs. This movie is trying > to help people have a better understanding of the origin of these events, as > some reasons that pushed all this youth to have such violent acts. As a > matter of fact TFD offers a sincere inside view from a French citizen who > lives in one of these neighborhoods where the riots took place. This > fictional documentary is strongly inspired by real events and reactions and > tries to make the spectator think more about how French society could and > should potentially be. Although he had no previous film-making experience, Chan decided to make his public statement as a film after he bought The Movies, a business simulation game released by Lionhead Studios on 8 November. After he progressed in the game far enough to unlock the desired film-making tools, he switched to Sandbox mode, in which he completed the film in three or four days. Because Chan had no computer microphone, the film presents dialogue in English subtitles. Despite his lack of fluency, he chose English to broaden his audience. Production was also affected by the limitations of The Movies. Restricted to the scenery provided by the software, Chan set the electrocution deaths in a shack. The game's Manhattan-based setting forced him to approximate the Paris M√©tro with the New York City Subway and to include the Empire State Building in the background. Given the game's choices for skin color, Chan needed to apply the lightest pigment available for blacks to one character. Reception Under the pseudonym Koulamata, Chan uploaded the finished film to The Movies Online on 22 November 2005. Some viewers praised it,; but others criticized the poor subtitles or the portrayal of police action against minorities. According to ', criticism was stronger in France than elsewhere. Lionhead's selection of The French Democracy as a \\"hot pick\\" led to redistribution from other Internet sites, followed by coverage in mainstream media‚Äîincluding The Washington Post, BusinessWeek, USA Today, and '.; The Washington Post and MTV originally created religious connotations by incorrectly labeling Chan's characters as Muslims; they issued corrected stories after Chan complained. In 2006, the film was shown at the Flash Festival at Centre Georges Pompidou and at the World Wide Short Film Festival in Toronto. By Chan's own assessment, The French Democracy is unpolished. The Washington Post found \\"broken English\\" in the subtitles, and BusinessWeek deemed them \\"stilted and ungrammatical\\". Josh Lee of PopMatters deemed the character animations of The Movies too exaggerated for the film's serious message; he felt that they made the film's depiction of police brutality seem better suited for the silent film comedy series Keystone Cops. ', a French Internet publication about media issues related to immigration, called the characters \\"'\\" (very ethnicized). However, some critics felt that these problems with production quality helped to convey the film's message. In a ' article, Franck Beau considered the film's aesthetic a strong point because, having originated in video games, it completely differed from those of traditional animation and filming. He argued that the work's power lay in its \\"'\\" (extreme simplicity) and in the \\"'\\" (logical operation) of the underlying video game. BusinessWeek wrote that \\"the combination of amateurish technique and a strong emotional message is oddly moving\\", and Henry Lowood of Stanford University similarly thought that the awkward subtitles and cinematography created a sense of authenticity. Lee found a filming precedent in Mathieu Kassovitz's 1995 work La Haine, also \\"lauded for its low-budget aesthetic as much as for its expressions of rage, fear, and alienation\\". A discussion panel at the AMAS' 2006 Machinima Film Festival compared Chan's work to Do the Right Thing (1989) and The Battle of Algiers (1966). Legacy Although earlier political machinima films existed, The French Democracy attained an unprecedented level of mainstream attention, according to Paul Marino, executive director of the Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences (AMAS). Based on the interest, Marino considered adding a documentary or commentary category to the AMAS' awards. Xavier Lardy, founder of machinima.fr, stated that no previous machinima work had \\"such a clear and prominent political message\\". Others further contrasted The French Democracys serious nature with the prevalence of gaming-related references in other machinima works, such as the Leeroy Jenkins video and Rooster Teeth Productions' comedy series Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles. Berkeley stated that The French Democracy was a rare exception to machinima's basis in \\"accepted cinematic and televisual conventions\\". The French Democracy was, according to ', \\"evidence that 'technological innovations are being used to satisfy the thirst for public expression\\",Translated and quoted in and Olli Sotamaa felt that the work justified further research into connections between citizenship and video gaming. Peter Molyneux, chief executive officer of Lionhead Studios, praised Chan's \\"timely and poignant\\" work for inspiring other commentary films on American and British society and for \\"demonstrating the potential power and impact that these films can have\\".Quoted in In CineAction, Elijah Horwatt wrote that Thuyen Nguyen's 2006 An Unfair War, a criticism of the Iraq War, similarly attempts \\"to speak for those who cannot\\". Joshua Garrison mimicked Chan's \\"political pseudo-documentary style\\" in his Virginia Tech Massacre, a controversial Halo 3‚Äìbased re-enactment of the eponymous real-life event.; Although initially undecided, Chan eventually became a professional machinima film-maker. His later work includes World of Electors, a series about the 2007 French presidential election. Writing for The Escapist, Allen Varney felt that the political awareness was overstated because the percentage of The Movies films that offered social commentary remained small and because the machinima and political communities were mostly separate. He argued that machinima's outstanding copyright issues and possible marginalization constrained potential for expression. Marino and others added concerns that, although game developers had condoned machinima, a controversial film could prompt them to control machinima content by enforcing their copyrights.; ; Notes References        External links * Category:2005 short films Category:French animated short films Category:English-language films Category:Political films based on actual events Category:2000s French animated films Category:French films Category:Machinima works Category:French political films Category:2005 animated films Category:2005 films Category:2000s political films ","title":"The French Democracy"},{"id":"3603343","text":"Agathidium bushi is a species of round fungus beetle in the family Leiodidae.

In contrast to many other 19th-century women writers, throughout most of her adult life she earned her living as an author; at the same time she often donated her writing for causes she believed in, such as the abolition of slavery. She stands out in History of Rhode Island. Some of her earliest writings were poems printed in the gazettes from 1830 to 1835. Her first volume was Memoirs of Eleanor Elbridge, a colored woman, of which there were sold more than 30,000 copies. In 1841, she published The Mechanic, a book addressed to the operatives of the country, which was much commended in Mr. Brownson's Boston Quarterly Review. In 1844, she published Might and Right, a history of the attempted revolution in Rhode Island, known as the Dorr Insurrection. During a part of the year 1842, she conducted The Wampanoag, a journal designed for the elevation of the laboring portion of the community, and thereafter, she was a large contributor to what were called \\"reform periodicals,\\" particularly The Nineteenth Century, a quarterly miscellany, and The Univercoelum and Spiritual Philosopher, a paper \\"devoted to philosophico-theology, and an exposition and inculcation of the principles of Nature, in their application to individual and social life.\\" In the autumn of 1848, she became editor of The Young People's Journal of Science, Literature, and Art, a monthly magazine printed in New York. Early years Frances Harriet Whipple was born on a farm in Smithfield, Rhode Island, 1805. She descended from two of the state's oldest, most distinguished families, but after her father's serious financial reversal she had to earn her own living at a very early age. Career She gained local recognition for her poetry and in 1838 anonymously penned a best-seller: The Memoirs of Elleanor Eldridge. The profits of this book helped Eldridge retrieve property that had been taken from her unjustly. In 1842, during the conflict of Rhode Island's Dorr Rebellion, McDougall supported Dorr's efforts to achieve reform of the state's voting laws. After this uprising was harshly suppressed, she fled to Connecticut where she lived \\"in exile\\" with her new husband, an artist named Charles Green. Their unhappy marriage ended in 1847 when Frances divorced Charles on grounds of non-support and desertion. She then moved to the area of New York City where she taught botany and wrote for spiritualist publications. In 1861, she moved to San Francisco. There she lectured and wrote against slavery, worked for women's rights, and served on the board of the first local women's typographical union. She also continued her spiritualist writing. At the age of 57, she married William McDougall, a miner who had been a California assemblyman and was the brother of the state's second governor, John McDougall. She died in 1878 in Oakland, California, where she was buried in Mountain View Cemetery. According to Griswold (1852), Green had perhaps entered more largely than any of her countrywomen into discussions of religion, philosophy, and polities. Her views were frequently original and ingenious, and they were nearly always stated with clearness and maintained with force of logic and felicity of illustration. A consideration of them would be more appropriate in a review of her prose-writings; their peculiarities were not disclosed in her poems, of which the only law was the sense of beauty. Style and themes Griswold (1852) remarked of Green's work thus:‚Äî References =Attribution= * =Bibliography= * External links * Memoirs of Elleanor Eldridge. Providence, R. I.: B.T. Albro, 1838.

As cited by . Let G be a group, and let :A=\\\\\\\\{a_1G_1,\\\\ \\\\ldots,\\\\ a_kG_k\\\\\\\\} be a finite system of left cosets of subgroups G_1,\\\\ldots,G_k of G. Herzog and Sch√∂nheim conjectured that if A forms a partition of G with k>1, then the (finite) indices [G:G_1],\\\\ldots,[G:G_k] cannot be distinct. In contrast, if repeated indices are allowed, then partitioning a group into cosets is easy: if H is any subgroup of G with index k=[G:H]<\\\\infty then G can be partitioned into k left cosets of H. Subnormal subgroups In 2004, Zhi- Wei Sun proved an extended version of the Herzog‚ÄìSch√∂nheim conjecture in the case where G_1,\\\\ldots,G_k are subnormal in G.. A basic lemma in Sun's proof states that if G_1,\\\\ldots,G_k are subnormal and of finite index in G, then :\\\\bigg[G:\\\\bigcap_{i=1}^kG_i\\\\bigg]\\\\ \\\\bigg\\\\ \\\\prod_{i=1}^k[G:G_i] and hence :P\\\\bigg(\\\\bigg[G:\\\\bigcap_{i=1}^kG_i\\\\bigg]\\\\ \\\\bigg) =\\\\bigcup_{i=1}^kP([G:G_i]), where P(n) denotes the set of prime divisors of n. Mirsky‚ÄìNewman theorem When G is the additive group \\\\Z of integers, the cosets of G are the arithmetic progressions. In this case, the Herzog‚ÄìSch√∂nheim conjecture states that every covering system, a family of arithmetic progressions that together cover all the integers, must either cover some integers more than once or include at least one pair of progressions that have the same difference as each other. This result was conjectured in 1950 by Paul Erd≈ës and proved soon thereafter by Leon Mirsky and Donald J. Newman. However, Mirsky and Newman never published their proof. The same proof was also found independently by Harold Davenport and Richard Rado.. In 1970, a geometric coloring problem equivalent to the Mirsky‚ÄìNewman theorem was given in the Soviet mathematical olympiad: suppose that the vertices of a regular polygon are colored in such a way that every color class itself forms the vertices of a regular polygon. Then, there exist two color classes that form congruent polygons.

Background and earlier life Hardinge was born in 1894, the son of Charles Hardinge (who was created Baron Hardinge of Penshurst in 1910 and served as Viceroy of India from 1910 to 1916). He was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards and fought in the First World War and became a Lieutenant and received the Military Cross. In 1920, he became Assistant Private Secretary to George V and was promoted Captain. On 8 February 1921, he married Helen Gascoyne-Cecil (a daughter of Lord Edward Gascoyne-Cecil) and they had three children. In 1929 he was promoted Major. Hardinge served as Assistant Private Secretary up until George V's death in 1936. Private Secretary to Edward VIII and George VI He was promoted to Private Secretary upon the accession of Edward VIII that same year, contributing to some delicate negotiations between the new king and the British government in the run up to the king's abdication in December 1936; he continued in this role under George VI until his early retirement in 1943. Significantly, as Brandi McCarry's commentary has pointed out, Hardinge's ultimate loyalty lay with the King in Parliament rather than personally with a monarch in conflict (and especially when the conflict was between the Sovereign and \\"his\\" Parliament). This was particularly reflected in Hardinge's warning letter to Edward, received on 13 November 1936, which showed evidence of prior consultation with Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, who, with his cabinet, had serious misgivings about the suitability of Mrs Wallis Simpson as the possible spouse of the monarch.Brandi McCarry Press, Politics and the Abdication of Edward VIII The precise nature and extent of his loyalty were thus constitutional‚Äîdoing what he thought was right in his post as Private Secretary to the Sovereign. Death and legacy Hardinge died in 1960 and his title was inherited by his son, George. His wife Helen wrote his biography Loyal to Three Kings, William Kimber, London 1967.

The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Enhydris dussumierii, p. 78). Morphology Diagnosis (genus): Dieurostus is distinguished from all other homalopsids with 25 or 27 rows of smooth scales, nasal scales in contact, and posterior labials horizontally divided, by its divided internasal, upper labials 1‚Äì3 contacting the loreal, five lower labials contacting the chin shields (Homalophis doriae has upper labials 2‚Äì5 or 2‚Äì6 contacting the loreal), and its striped pattern (Ferania sieboldii has a blotched-banded dorsal pattern, the internasal may contact the loreal, and it has three lower labials contacting the chin shields) [after Kumar et al. 2012]. Geographic range D. dussumieri is endemic to coastal plains of southwestern India (in Kerala). Habits D. dussumieri is a thoroughly aquatic snake, and is more evident during the rains. This species has been sighted in inundated rice paddies, flooded crop fields and is very much at home in lakes and swamps. On land its movements are rather clumsy and laboured. It feeds mostly on fishes and takes refuge in crab-holes on mud banks and other such safe retreats near water bodies.

History The club was formed in 1977 as the Hoppers Crossing Footballers Cricket Club after it received its initial financial backing from the Hoppers Crossing Football Club (HCFC). Shortly into its first season, sufficient funds were raised to recompense the Football Club and it was renamed the Hoppers Crossing Cricket Club (HCCC). The first team was entered into the \\"B-turf\\" section of the Sunshine Cricket Association in season 1977/78. The club were runners-up in the first season. After this, the club grew quickly to a level where four open age teams were taking the field. Junior cricket was introduced and teams were entered into a local Under-14 competition in the Wyndham area. Following the initial set up, HCCC took over the running of this competition, which comprised six teams. The club benefited greatly from this structure, as evidenced by the three Under-14 premierships in a row, on entry into the SCA's Under-14 competition. At the commencement of the 1983/84 season, it transferred into the Williamstown and District Cricket Association (WDCA). This was in conjunction with the club's move from its prior residence, in Heaths Road, to its current Hogans Road address. Shortly after this move, a turf wicket was installed on the number one oval with the assistance of the then Werribee Council. The 1986/87 season saw the appointment of the club's first ever coach, Greg Evans. In his first year at the helm, Greg took the club to the runners-up position. At the commencement of the 1989/90 season, the club took its next evolutionary step by entering its first and second elevens into the Victorian Junior Cricket Association (now the Victorian Turf Cricket Association (VTCA)). During this season under the coaching of Mark Mitchell, it won its first ever First Eleven premiership, in the North Central Division. It then gained promotion into North A through to Senior A. In 2015, the club was entered into the Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association (VSDCA). In that first season, (2015/16) the First and Third Elevens lost in the first week of finals. The Firsts to the eventual runners-up, Caulfield, and the Thirds to the season winners Yarraville. HCCC Alumni Since the commencement of the club, it has produced nine First Eleven District Players with five at Footscray (Mark Mitchell, Jamie Rubeli, Grant Burns, Paul Murray and Nathan Caulfield), two at North Melbourne (Trent Said, Ian Timms), one at University (Greg Kennedy) and one at Richmond (Brodie Andrew). Two of these players have represented Victoria at state level (Mark Mitchell in the Under 19s and Paul Murray in the Under 21s). The club has had numerous junior cricketers represented in the various representative sides available within Victoria. Englishman Stuart Broad played for the team in the summer of 2004-05, and went on to play first-class cricket for Leicestershire, the England U-19 team in 2005 and England A in 2006. Broad played his first One Day International for England against Pakistan in 2006 and made his Test debut against Sri Lanka in 2007. He has recently succeeded in Test cricket by taking his 500th Test match wicket in the 2020 Test series between England and West Indies. Englishman Matthew Boyce, who also represented Leicestershire recently against Pakistan played for the club in its 2003-04 season. Hoppers Crossing is also the home club of Fawad Ahmed. Fawad played brilliantly during his time at the Cats including taking two 8 wicket hauls. He made his international debut in a T20 against England on the 29th of August, 2013. He then made his ODI debut in a match against Scotland five days later. Ahmed has also had massive success playing with Victoria in the Australian domestic one- day cup and the 4-day Sheffield Shield competition. The leg-spinner won three Shield titles in a row from 2014/15 to 2016/17. Current Teams Currently the club fields 4 senior turf sides in the VSDCA plus a side in the Victorian Veterans competition, women's side and 2 synthetic sides in the WSCCCA. They also field 13 junior teams including a junior girls team.

In 1963 it became the first interstate high school in the country as part of a bill that was the last ever signed into action by John F. Kennedy. Today it accepts students from several communities in New Hampshire and Vermont. Enrollment is approximately 786 students, the majority of whom come from the towns of Hanover (New Hampshire) and Norwich, Vermont. 11% of the student body attends on a tuition basis from towns such as Cornish and Lyme, New Hampshire, and Strafford and Hartland, Vermont. The school employs 79 full-time faculty members. Academics Hanover High was recognized in 2009 by BusinessWeek in their \\"America's Best High Schools\\" annual article as having the \\"Best Overall Academic Performance\\" in New Hampshire, with a GreatSchools rating of 10/10. The school is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, and over 96% of students are accepted to or are planning to attend post secondary education after graduating. Of the 85 professional staff at Hanover High School, 71% hold at least a master's degree, while 18% hold a master's degree + 60 credits or a doctorate. The academic program is divided into the traditional five departments: English, Math, Science, Social Studies, and Foreign Language. Each department offers a selection of courses; however, all freshmen must take a standard set of courses. As students advance, additional opportunities become available. The school's curriculum and policies emphasize individual student freedoms. For example, seniors often elect to design and complete an independent study project that academically explores a personal interest. With Dartmouth College a short walk from the school, some students attend courses at the college when they have exhausted the high school's offerings. The academic atmosphere is generally student-centric, with off- campus privileges widely available and with a council of students, faculty, and community members (founded in 1974) whose governing power extends in many areas beyond that of even the school principal. Extracurricular and elective activities Hanover's physical education program, for 9th graders, has an extensive outdoor ropes course, which is one of the largest in the world with over 35 high ropes course elements, as well as a comprehensive indoor ropes course and climbing wall. Begun in 1988 by physical education teacher Glyn Reinders, the outdoor education program has become the core of Hanover's physical education curriculum and is considered one of the premier high school programs in the country. The girls' cross country team was fourth in the nation during the 2007 season. The boys' varsity soccer team has won the state championship for the last six years, as well as the state sportsmanship award for the past four years. The boys' hockey and lacrosse teams are both the smallest schools in Division I, yet Hanover almost always makes it to the state finals in at least one of the sports, if not both. The 2009 fall campaign was especially successful, with field hockey, boys' cross country, girls' cross country and boys' soccer all being crowned state champions. The school boasts a large number of music ensembles (both official and student- run), publications, community service organizations, an official drama group \\"Footlighters\\" that puts on two shows and a musical each year, a student- organized drama group \\"SOS; Students On Stage\\" that puts on one show a year, and a quiz bowl team that has in recent years won both New Hampshire and Vermont state championships. Hanover High School is one of the few public schools in New Hampshire to have a crew team. It is the largest sport at Hanover, with one in every six students participating. They have been recognized as one of the top public school rowing programs consecutively in New Hampshire. HHS is a democratic school revolving around the Hanover High Council.The Council The council has the authority to act on all matters at Hanover High School not controlled by school board policy, state policy, administrative regulations established by the Superintendent of the Schools, and rules and regulations published in the Student Handbook of Hanover High School. Council elections are held each spring. Athletics Hanover has a comprehensive athletics program, with players competing at both the varsity and junior varsity levels. Sports offered include baseball, basketball, cross country running, cross-country skiing, crew, field hockey, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, rugby, ski jumping, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, Ultimate, and volleyball. The boys' cross country running team won back-to-back state championships in 2008 and 2009. The boys' soccer team is perennially the most successful team at Hanover, having won the Class I state championships every year from 2005‚Äì2010, and the Division I title in 2013 and 2019. They have won a state-record total of 18 overall, while the boys' ice hockey team is very successful in the competitive NH Division I, where nearly all the other schools are much larger than Hanover. The boys' golf team has been consistently one of the top programs in the state, winning over 30 state championships since the early 1980s. Many former Marauder golfers are now members of the PGA. In 1989 the golf team finished an undefeated 48-0 season under coach Glyn Reinders and were named by the Boston Globe \\"New England Team of the Year\\". Notable girls' teams include the perennial power house cross country team, which won the Class I state championship from 2004 through 2009, and placed fourth at the Nike Team Nationals high school championships. The girls' soccer team has also won NH Division II championships in 2014, 2015 and 2018. The girls' varsity tennis team appeared in five consecutive state championship finals from 2013 through 2017. The football team is a strong force in NH Division IV, but hasn't won a state championship since 2005, despite making it to every state final since then. In recent years swimming has become one of the favored sports, along with crew. One out of every six Hanover High students row in the spring each year.

He was best known for his controversial duel with Bruce Lee in 1964. Early life Born in 1941 in Hong Kong,\\"The time was late winter, 1964... this fighter was also 24 and also of Chinese descent.\\" (Dorgan) Wong was a master of Taijiquan, Xingyiquan and Northern Shaolin.Dorgan, Michael. Bruce Lee's Toughest Fight, 1980 July. Official Karate Fight with Bruce Lee Accounts of Wong's fight with Lee are controversial, as it was unrecorded and held privately at Chinatown, Oakland in 1964, when both men were in their early 20s.GM Al Dacascos, Kajukenbo Today. September 19, 2007. According to Linda Lee Cadwell, Bruce Lee's wife, Lee's teaching of Chinese martial arts to white people made him unpopular with Chinese martial artists in San Francisco. Wong contested the notion that Lee was fighting for the right to teach whites\\"..the right to teach Caucasians the ancient Chinese fighting secrets. It is a notion that Wong finds ridiculous.\\" (Dorgan) as most of his students were Chinese.\\"most‚Äîbut not all‚Äîof his students during his first years were teaching were Chinese\\" (Dorgan) Wong stated that he requested a public fight with Lee after Lee had issued an open challenge during a demonstration at a Chinatown theater in which he claimed to be able to defeat any martial artist in San Francisco.\\"Lee had boasted during a demonstration at a Chinatown theater that he could beat any martial artist in San Francisco and had issued an open challenge..\\" (Dorgan) Wong stated it was after a mutual acquaintance delivered a note from Lee inviting him to fight that he showed up at Lee's school to challenge him. According to author Norman Borine, Wong tried to delay the match and asked for restrictions on techniques such as hitting the face, groin kicks, and eye jabs, and that the two fought no holds barred after Lee turned down the request. The details of the fight vary depending on the account. Individuals known to have witnessed the match included Cadwell, James Lee (an associate of Bruce Lee, no relation) and William Chen, a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan. According to Linda, the fight lasted three minutes with a decisive victory for Bruce. Lee gave a description, without naming Wong explicitly, in an interview with Black Belt. :\\"I'd gotten into a fight in San Francisco with a Kung-Fu cat, and after a brief encounter the son-of-a-bitch started to run. I chased him and, like a fool, kept punching him behind his head and back. Soon my fists began to swell from hitting his hard head. Right then I realized Wing Chun was not too practical and began to alter my way of fighting.\\" Cadwell recounted the scene in her book Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew (1975): :\\"The two came out, bowed formally and then began to fight. Wong adopted a classic stance whereas Bruce, who at the time was still using his Wing Chun style, produced a series of straight punches. Within a minute, Wong's men were trying to stop the fight as Bruce began to warm to his task. James Lee warned them to let the fight continue. A minute later, with Bruce continuing the attack in earnest, Wong began to backpedal as fast as he could. For an instant, indeed, the scrap threatened to degenerate into a farce as Wong actually turned and ran. But Bruce pounced on him like a springing leopard and brought him to the floor where he began pounding him into a state of demoralization. \\"Is that enough?\\" shouted Bruce, \\"That's enough!\\" pleaded his adversary. Bruce demanded a second reply to his question to make sure that he understood this was the end of the fight.\\" This is in contrast to Wong and William Chen's account of the fight as they state the fight lasted an unusually long 20‚Äì25 minutes. Wong was unsatisfied with Lee's account of the match and published his own version in the Chinese Pacific Weekly, a Chinese language newspaper in San Francisco.\\"Wong's version of the fight, along with the challenge, was run as the top story on the front page...\\" (Dorgan) The article, which was featured on the front page, included a detailed description of the fight from Wong's perspective and concluded with an invitation to Bruce Lee for a public match if Lee found his version to be unacceptable. Lee never made a public response to the article. Because Lee never responded to this public request, also closed his school, and moved out of the area shortly after the fight, the Chinese martial arts community in San Francisco concluded that Lee lost. In \\"Bruce Lee: A Life\\" by Matthew Polly, who shares a few insights from his extensive research and interview process, he says that according to David Chin, who arranged the match on Wong‚Äôs behalf, Bruce overwhelmed Wong with his opening series of attacks, causing Wong to turn his back and run. Bruce chased him around the room until Wong tripped and fell. Bruce jumped on top of Wong and rained down punches, forcing Chin to intervene and rescue Wong.https://ew.com/books/2018/07/20/bruce-lee-death-biography/ Wong later expressed regret over fighting Lee, attributing it to arrogance, both on the part of Lee and himself.\\"Wong attributes both Lee's initial challenge and his response to the same emotion, to arrogance. \\"If I had it to do over,\\" he says, \\" I wouldn't.\\"\\" (Dorgan) Later life and death Wong instructed classes at the Fort Mason Center in San Francisco, and in Oakland, CA, at the First Unitarian Church, for the better part of five decades before retiring in 2005.

Such projects typically take place on the internet using social software and computer-supported collaboration tools such as wiki technologies, which provide a potentially infinite hypertextual substrate within which the collaboration may be situated. Open source software such as Linux was developed via mass collaboration. Factors =Modularity= Modularity enables a mass of experiments to proceed in parallel, with different teams working on the same modules, each proposing different solutions. Modularity allows different \\"blocks\\" to be easily assembled, facilitating decentralised innovation that all fits together. Differences =Cooperation= Mass collaboration differs from mass cooperation in that the creative acts taking place require the joint development of shared understandings. Conversely, group members involved in cooperation needn't engage in a joint negotiation of understanding; they may simply execute instructions willingly. Another important distinction is the borders around which a mass cooperation can be defined. Due to the extremely general characteristics and lack of need for fine grain negotiation and consensus when cooperating, the entire internet, a city, and even the global economy may be regarded as examples of mass cooperation. Thus mass collaboration is more refined and complex in its process and production on the level of collective engagement. =Online forum= Although an online discussion is certainly collaborative, mass collaboration differs from a large forum, email list, bulletin board, chat session or group discussion in that the discussion's structure of separate, individual posts generated through turn-taking communication means the textual content does not take the form of a single, coherent body. Of course the conceptual domain of the overall discussion exists as a single unified body, however the textual contributors can be linked back to the understandings and interpretations of a single author. Though the author's understandings and interpretations are most certainly a negotiation of the understandings of all who read and contribute to the discussion, the fact that there was only one author of a given entry reduces the entry's collaborative complexity to the discursive/interpretive as opposed to constructive/‚Äònegotiative‚Äô levelsKapor presentation , UC Berkeley, 2005-11-09: Cover story: Google's Next Big Dream, Imagine what you could do with the world's mightiest computer, BusinessWeek, 2007-12-24.Plato, The Republic, Book VIII: \\"democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot... \\"the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the 'don't care' about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city... how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet, never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the people's friend... \\"in what manner does tyranny arise? ‚Äî that it has a democratic origin is evident...\\" And see generally Eric Havelock, The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics (London: Jonathan Cape, 1957), (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964). =Coauthoring= From the perspective of individual sites of work within a mass collaboration, the activity may appear to be identical to that of coauthoring. In fact, it is, with the exception being the implicit and explicit relationships formed by the interdependence that many sites within a mass collaboration share through hypertext and coauthorship with differing sets of collaborators. This interdependence of collaborative sites coauthored by a large number of people is what gives a mass collaboration one of its most distinguishing features - a coherent collaboration emerging from the interrelated collection of its parts. = Collective online tools = Many of the web applications associated with Bulletin boards, or forums can include a wide variety of tools that allows individuals to keep track of sites and content that they find on the internet. Users are able to bookmark from their browser by editing the title, adding a description and most importantly classifying using tags. Other non-collective tools are also used in Mass collaborative environments such as commenting, rating and quick evaluation. Changes =Business= In the books Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything and MacroWikinomics- Rebooting business and the world, Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams list five powerful new ideas that the new art and science of wikinomics is based on: * being open * peering * sharing * acting globally * interdependence The concept of mass collaboration has led to a number of efforts to harness and commercialize shared tasks. Collectively known as crowdsourcing, these ventures typically involve on an online system of accounts for coordinating buyers and sellers of labor. Amazon's Mechanical Turk system follows this model, by enabling employers to distribute minute tasks to thousands of registered workers. In the advertising industry, Giant Hydra employs mass collaboration to enable creatives to collaborate on advertising ideas online and create what they call an 'idea matrix', a highly complex node of concepts, executions and ideas all connected to each other. In the financial industry, companies such as the Open Models Valuation Company (OMVCO) also employ mass collaboration to improve the accuracy of financial forecasts. The role of discussion In traditional collaborative scenarios discussion plays a key role in the negotiation of jointly developed, shared understandings (the essence of collaboration), acting as a point of mediation between the individual collaborators and the outcome which may or may not eventuate from the discussions. Mass collaboration reverses this relationship with the work being done providing the point of mediation between collaborators, with associated discussions being an optional component. It is of course debatable that discussion is optimal, as most (if not all) mass collaborations have discussions associated with the content being developed. However it is possible to contribute (to Wikipedia for instance) without discussing the content you are contributing to. (Smaller scale collaborations might be conducted without discussions especially in a non-verbal mode of work - imagine two painters contributing to the same canvas - but the situation becomes increasingly problematic as more members are included.) Non- textual Although the only widely successful examples of mass collaboration thus far evaluated exist in the textual medium, there is no immediate reason why this form of collective action couldn't work in other creative media. It could be argued that some projects within the open source software movement provide examples of mass collaboration outside of the traditional written language (see below), however, the code collaboratively created still exists as a language utilizing a textual medium. Music is also a possible site for mass collaboration, for instance on live performance recordings where audience members' voices have become part of the standard version of a song. Most \\"anonymous\\" folk songs and \\"traditional\\" tunes are also arguably sites of long term mass collaboration.

The species is endemic to Asia. It is the only species in the genus Gerarda. Etymology The generic name, Gerarda, is in honor of someone named \\"Gerard\\". Unfortunately, Gray, who named the genus in 1849, did not specify whom he was honoring. Two possibilities are Adam Gerard or Rev. Gerard R. Smith, both of whom sent specimens of reptiles to Gray at the British Museum.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Genus Gerarda, p. 99; species G. prevostiana, p. 211). The specific name, prevostiana, is in honor of French naturalist and illustrator Florent Pr√©vost. Diet G. prevostiana feeds almost exclusively on crabs, which it tears into bite-sized pieces by pulling them through its coils, in contrast to most other snakes which swallow their prey whole.Jayne BC, Voris HK, Ng PKL (2002). \\"Snake circumvents constraints on prey size\\". Nature 418: 143. Description G. prevostiana has the following scalation. The frontal is a little longer than broad, shorter than its distance from the end of the snout, or than the parietals. The loreal is slightly longer than deep, a little smaller than the nasal. There is one preocular, and there are two postoculars. The temporals are arranged 1+2. There are eight upper labials, the fourth entering the eye. Four of the lower labials are in contact with the anterior chin shields. The anterior chin shields are much larger than the posterior chin shields. The dorsal scales are in 17 rows at midbody. The ventrals number 146‚Äì158. The anal is divided. The subcaudals number 31‚Äì34. The body is uniform dark olive above, with three outer rows of scales whitish. The upper lip is white, and the rostral is dark olive. The ventrals and subcaudals are whitish, with dark edges.Boulenger GA (1890). The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma. Reptilia and Batrachia. London: Secretary of State for India in Council. (Taylor & Francis, printers). xviii + 541 pp. (Gerardia [sic] prevostiana, p. 379). The total length is 41 cm (16 inches), including the tail which is 5 cm (2 inches) long. Geographic range G. prevostiana is found in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia), Myanmar (= Burma), Philippine Islands (Mindanao), Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.

His primary focus is sports, particularly those in the Southeast. After many years as a reporter, columnist, and sports-talk radio host in the Birmingham area, Finebaum was hired by ESPN in 2013 for its new SEC Network starting in 2014, and produces a radio show out of the network's regional base in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Career  =News reporter= Finebaum arrived in Birmingham in 1980 and became a columnist and reporter for the Birmingham Post-Herald. Finebaum's work has earned him more than 250 national, regional, and area sports writing awards, including his stories on the recruitment of Alabama basketball player Buck Johnson. He also in 1993 broke the story of Antonio Langham, a University of Alabama football player who signed a contract with a sports agent while playing for the school, which led to an NCAA probation for the school. He was also the first to report the firing of Auburn University coach Terry Bowden in 1998. Finebaum joined the Mobile Press Register in 2001 where he wrote a twice-weekly (later weekly) column with the column syndicated to other newspapers. Finebaum discontinued the column in December 2010. On September 1, Finebaum returned to writing with his first column for Sports Illustrated. His weekly column appears every Thursday at SI.com. =Radio career= Early career Finebaum started his radio appearances in the mid-1980s by giving morning commentary on the Mark and Brian Radio Show on WAPI-FM (I-95). After starting his own afternoon radio show a few years later on WAPI-AM, his program quickly became the highest-rated sport-talk show in Birmingham. In October 1993, Finebaum moved his sports-talk show to WERC. The Paul Finebaum Radio Network In 2001, Finebaum, along with Network Director Pat Smith and Producer Kerry Adams, launched The Paul Finebaum Radio Network, syndicated with affiliates across the southeast. It was named in 2004 by Sports Illustrated as one of the top 12 sports radio shows in the United States. In January 2007, his radio show moved to WJOX. Finebaum found himself embroiled at the center of one of biggest college sports stories in America in 2011 ‚Äì the poisoning of the famous trees on Toomer's Corner at Auburn University. The man charged, Harvey Updyke, called the Finebaum show, claiming to have poisoned the trees. The audio of the call was played on nearly every national radio show and television newscast in the nation. In the aftermath, Finebaum was featured on the NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams, appeared on CNN, ESPN, MSNBC, and several other networks. He also was blamed by many for the event including one caller saying \\"if anything else happens, there will be blood on your hands.\\" On April 21, Updyke appeared again on the Finebaum show, speaking publicly for the first time since the incident, breaking his long silence. The interview, perhaps the most listened to ever in the history of the Finebaum show, made national news, appearing in publications ranging from The New York Times to ESPN's SportsCenter. Updyke ended the 45-minute interview with his signature Roll Damn Tide. ESPN Finebaum's show went off the air on WJOX temporarily on January 21, 2013, when his contract with Cumulus and WJOX expired. The New Yorker reported he \\"had talks with ESPN and CBS, about joining their national radio networks, and with SiriusXM, about moving permanently to satellite.\\" In May 2013, Finebaum signed with ESPN to appear on its new SEC Network beginning in 2014, and also hosts a daily radio show based out of Charlotte. =Television= Finebaum's television contributions have been numerous. In Birmingham he currently appears as a sports analyst for WBRC. He was sports director for WIAT-TV from 1998 to 2002 and co-hosted individual shows on WVTM-TV and WBMA. Finebaum also had a leading role in ESPN's documentary Roll Tide/War Eagle. The producers used Finebaum and his program as the voice of the documentary, which debuted on November 8, 2011. As part of the deal Finebaum signed with ESPN in May 2013, he agreed to appear on its new SEC Network starting in 2014, hosting The Paul Finebaum Show in simulcast for ESPN Radio. As an extension of the radio show, Finebaum has also hosted special broadcasts on SEC Network as part of ESPN Megacasts involving SEC teams‚Äîthe Finebaum Film Room‚Äîparticularly during College Football Playoff National Championship games. Publications Finebaum's books include his popular I Hate... series, including I Hate Michigan: 303 Reasons Why You Should, Too, and several dozen similarly titled works. Finebaum's other books include The Worst of Paul Finebaum (), a 1994 compilation of some of the newspaper columns he has written; and Finebaum Said (), a 2001 collection of columns and interviews. On March 27, 2013, the Birmingham News reported that Finebaum agreed to an advance (later reported to be $650,000) with HarperCollins to write a book about the radio show. HarperCollins Senior Vice President and Executive Editor David Hirshey said \\"We expect this book to occupy the same spot on the best-seller list that Alabama occupies in the BCS rankings ‚Äì number one.\\" In February, Publishers Weekly reported the book would arrive on August 5 with a first run of 150,000 copies. The book, which was excerpted in the Wall Street Journal on August 5, quickly made the New York Times best-seller list, landing at No. 6 among sports books. The book remained on the best-seller list for five months. Recognition Finebaum (left) at the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship media day In 2002, Finebaum was named by The Tennessean in Nashville as one of the Southeastern Conference's Top Power Brokers. In July 2009, The Orlando Sentinel named Finebaum as one of the SEC's 10 most powerful people. On January 11, 2011, CNBC's Emmy-Award-winning sports reporter, Darren Rovell wrote: \\"Back 2 back titles by Alabama & Auburn make Finebaum the most powerful small market sports media member in the nation\\" and called him \\"the best listener of any sports talk radio host.\\" In December 2012, Sports Illustrated, in its year-end review of sports media, listed gave Finebaum an Honorable Mention along with 10 other names for \\"Best National Radio Voice\\". Reeves Wiedeman profiled the radio host in a 5,000-word article, \\"King of the South\\", in the December 10, 2012 edition of the New Yorker. According to the Wiedeman, it was The New Yorker's first major piece on a college football figure in more than 10 years. Several months later, on February 6, 2013, The Wall Street Journal, in a profile by writer Rachel Bachman, stated: \\"Paul Finebaum is not only one of the nation's best- known sports-talk radio hosts. He is perhaps college football's best-known voice since TV announcer Keith Jackson retired.\\" The Journal ended the story, referring to Finebaum as \\"the Oprah Winfrey of college football.\\" On March 6, 2013, Sports Illustrateds Richard Deitsch unveiled a ranking of the 20 Most Powerful People in Sports Media nationally and Finebaum came in at No. 17. In October 2013, the University of Tennessee presenting Finebaum with the \\"Accomplished Alumni Award,\\" \\"which recognizes notable alumni for their success and distinction within their field.\\" ESPN broadcaster Joe Tessitore said in a December 2018 podcast interview, \\"If you asked me who are the two greatest interviewers on radio and television, I would say Paul Finebaum and Howard Stern.\\" In the College GameDay episode of Origins, James Andrew Miller said: \\"Paul Finebaum knows the American Southeast like Jay-Z knows Brooklyn. And that's a big blast of wind at your back if your job is covering college football. His instincts as an interviewer rank him in the top tier of the sports world. And he is beyond mere savvy when it comes to speaking very virally.\\" Personal life Finebaum was born in Memphis, Tennessee. He and his wife Linda Hudson have been married since 1990. Finebaum is Jewish. Finebaum attended Christian Brothers High School and White Station High School in Memphis before graduating from the University of Tennessee, where he received a degree in political science in 1978.

Salma's also got a black shadowy nothingness that Buffy can sense but can barely fight. Meanwhile, in LA, Angel is tied down by a case where his client is wrongfully accused of murder by crooked cops while Cordelia discovers a pack of pre-teens who revere vampires and have been promised eternal life by a vampire. Buffy's work takes her to LA along with Willow to the de la Navidad household where the same black shadow continues to attack Salma. When Salma suddenly disappears as does Kayley (one of the vampire lovers) everyone knows that something is up.

Biography Vincenzo's father, Giuseppe Giustiniani, had been the last Genoese ruler of the Aegean island of Chios, which had been a family possession for centuries. In 1566 the island was lost to the Ottomans, and Vincenzo and his elder brother Benedetto were taken by their father to Rome, where an uncle was already a cardinal. Giuseppe Giustiniani became a banker, and by his death in 1600 was financier to the Vatican and one of the richest men in Rome. Vincenzo Giustiniani followed his father into the family business, while Benedetto entered the Church and became a cardinal himself, 16 November 1586.Miranda, \\"Cardinals of the Holy Roman church\\": Benedetto Giustiniani Both brothers were keen art patrons, and the collection they established became one of the most important in its age. On Giustiniani's death - Benedetto died in 1621 - it contained over 300 paintings (15 by Caravaggio) and more than 1200 pieces of sculpture, and the various catalogues constitute an invaluable resource for early 17th- century art. In 1631, the Galleria Giustiniani was published under supervision of Joachim von Sandrart, in the form of a compilation of engravings of the family's gallery of statuary, most notably the Athena Giustiniani, and the Giustiniani Hestia. Giustiniani followed interests in many other fields, writing essays in architecture, music, and art, as well as on such practical matters as hunting, travel, and horse trading. A friend and neighbour of Caravaggio's first patron, cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, he extended his own friendship to the artist, purchasing Saint Matthew and the Angel when it was rejected by church officials for its perceived lack of decorum. He died in Rome in 1637. Legacy The Giustiniani head of Apollo (now in the British Museum) The collection itself was broken up at the beginning of the 19th century, when the king of Prussia acquired over 160 paintings, the most important of which were destined for museums in Berlin. Today the Berlin Gem√§ldegalerie houses 43 paintings from the Giustinani collection, while other works are to be found in Potsdam's Neues Palais and Bildergalerie Sanssouci. Further examples can be seen in the National Gallery, London, the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg and the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. More paintings from the collection have been traced to collections and museums in Europe and the United States.

The plot revolves around the Scooby Gang and the Angel Investigations team joining forces to defeat General Axtius, the father of Angel's deceased ally Doyle. Plot summary Doyle's pure-blood Brachen demon father Axtius is the General for the Coalition of Purity which believes that all half-blood demons should be banished, leaving only the pure-bloods on Earth. Both Angel and Buffy are dealing with this threat in their respective cities when Buffy's team learns that General Axtius plans to attack a half- blood demon safe haven island near Los Angeles. Uprooting the Scooby Gang, Buffy and the rest of them travel quickly to Los Angeles to help Angel deal with the increasing problem. Unfortunately, the demons on the island who are in need of saving seem to be skeptical about having vampires as well as the Slayer on their island and they must be convinced that it's for their benefit before General Axtius and his troops launch a full-fledged attack on the island. In their final confrontation on the island, Angel defeats Axtius when unarmed despite Axtius wielding a powerful mystical weapon, taunting the Brachen by saying that he would have been ashamed of Doyle's very human act of sacrifice and redemption. Having been defeated by Angel, Axtius is subsequently incinerated by his former second-in-command for his failure to destroy the island.

It is located on Stevens Creek Boulevard in San Jose and Santa Clara, one of Silicon Valley's premier shopping streets and nearby Santana Row. Westfield Valley Fair is one of the largest malls in the United States and has the highest-sales volume in California, with $1,150 per square foot.http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/05/14/inside-westfields-big- plans-for-its-600m-valley.html?page=all/ The shopping center consists of 273 stores, a seventeen-outlet food court, nine restaurants, and three department stores. History Westfield Valley Fair's Grand Valet & Steven's Creek Boulevard Entrance Westfield Valley Fair is unique in that it replaced two separate 1950s-era shopping centers. The original Valley Fair Shopping Center, opened in 1956, was confined to the eastern side of the property in San Jose. It was developed and anchored by Macy's and included roughly 40 other stores including Joseph Magnin in an outdoor plaza. At the western side was another outdoor shopping center, Stevens Creek Plaza in Santa Clara. It was anchored by The Emporium and I. Magnin. For that reason, the current mall contributes sales tax revenues to both the cities of San Jose and Santa Clara, and is regulated by both city governments. In 1986, both centers were acquired and merged into one two-level enclosed mall by The Hahn Company, creating one of the most successful shopping centers in the country, called simply \\"Valley Fair\\". Nordstrom joined later in 1987, with I. Magnin closing its store in 1992. The former Emporium store became a second Macy's location in 1996, housing Macy's Men's & Home Store. The former I. Magnin housed a succession of tenants, its final one being Sports Authority, and its building sits vacant. It will be demolished, along with the former Old Navy building, as part of the mall's upcoming expansion. In 1998, Westfield America, Inc., a predecessor of the Westfield Group and The Rouse Company acquired Valley Fair jointly from Hahn. Westfield bought out Rouse in 1999 and brought in an institutional investment partner to share its investment risk in this high-profile property. In 1998 the property was renamed Westfield Shoppingtown Valley Fair. Nordstrom replaced its location in 2001 during the grand opening of a new $165 million, two-phase redevelopment. The former Nordstrom reopened as additional mall retail space in the second phase in 2002. Westfield discontinued the \\"Shoppingtown\\" moniker in 2005. A major remodel of the center commenced in 2013, bringing the mall a revamped \\"Dining Terrace\\" with local concepts alongside national chains, and a major reshuffling of tenants.http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/07/10/here-is-what- westfield-valley-fairs.html Nordstrom was extensively remodeled, adding two new restaurant concepts and a completely revamped store design.http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/04/01/nordstrom-valley- fair-getting-fresh.html The mall's lower level Nordstrom wing was reconfigured into a \\"Luxury Collection\\", with new luxury tenants like Balenciaga, Mulberry, Saint Laurent Paris, Bottega Veneta, Versace, Giorgio Armani, Tory Burch, Salvatore Ferragamo, and Prada joining existing tenants Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co..http://hauteliving.com/2014/09/luxury-wing-adds-pizzazz- westfield-valley-fair/523730/ In 2012, San Jose raised its minimum wage to $10 USD an hour, but Santa Clara did not, leading to what the NPR Planet Money team dubbed \\"A Mall Divided,\\" where workers on one side of the mall were being paid $2 less than the other side. A Gap clothing store located on the two city lines was required to either account for how long its employees spent in each city or raise its wages for all employees to the San Jose minimum wage; they chose to raise the wages. Expansion The San Jose location of Din Tai Fung, ranked as one of the world's best restaurants by the New York Times. In 2007 Westfield announced major expansion plans which would increase the gross leaseable area to over , adding anchor stores Bloomingdale's and Eataly, 100 shops, and a 3000 space parking structure. Westfield was granted approval for the expansion by the city of San Jose in November 2007. It was to be completed by September 2011.https://www.mercurynews.com/2008/09/11/bloomingdales-neiman- marcus-to-open-stores-at-valley-fair-in-2011/ However, the expansion was put on hold in 2008 due to the global recession.

Overview Aesthetic relativism might be regarded as a sub-set of an overall philosophical relativism, which denies any absolute standards of truth or morality as well as of aesthetic judgement. (A frequently-cited source for philosophical relativism in postmodern theory is a fragment by Nietzsche, entitled \\"On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense\\".) For example, in historical terms, the female form as depicted in the Venus of Willendorf and the women in the paintings of Rubens would today be regarded as over-weight, while the slim models on the covers of contemporary fashion magazines would no doubt be regarded in a negative light by our predecessors. Aesthetic relativism is a variety of the philosophy known generally as relativism, which casts doubt on the possibility of direct epistemic access to the \\"external world\\", and which therefore rejects the positive claim that statements made about the external world can be known to be objectively true. Other varieties of relativism include cognitive relativism (the general claim that all truth and knowledge is relative) and ethical relativism (the claim that moral judgments are relative). Aesthetic and ethical relativism are sub- categories of cognitive relativism. Philosophers who have been influential in relativist thinking include David Hume, particularly his \\"radical scepticism\\" as set out in A Treatise of Human Nature; Thomas Kuhn, with regard to the history and philosophy of science, and particularly his work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; Friedrich Nietzsche, in moral philosophy and epistemology; and Richard Rorty, on the contingency of language. Philosophers who have given influential objectivist accounts include Plato, and in particular his Theory of the Forms; Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, despite being subjective, is a universally practiced function of the mind; Noam Chomsky, whose \\"nativist\\" theory of linguistics argues for a universal grammar (i.e., that language is not as contingent as relativists have argued that it is). The most prominent philosophical opponent of aesthetic relativism was Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, while subjective, is universal.

In the episode, Glenn Howard is hunted down in a lethally polluted Los Angeles of the future, where the fascist government is ruled by psychiatrists and the populace has been driven to live in underground bunkers to survive the pollution. But at the end, Howard wakes up to discover that it was a dream, which allowed the science-fiction plot to fit into the modern-day setting of the show. Steven Bochco received one of his first writing credits on the series, and served as story editor for the third- season Robert Stack episodes. Segment Producers / Executive Producers included David Victor (The Man From U.N.C.L.E. etc.), Dean Hargrove (U.N.C.L.E., Perry Mason Returns, Diagnosis Murder etc.), Gene L. Coon (Star Trek etc.), and Leslie Stevens (The Outer Limits, Mystery Movies etc.) The Universal Studios headquarters building was used for the exterior shots of the \\"Howard Publications\\" building.Waters, Harry F., \\"Universal's Film Factory,\\" Newseek, Vol. 81, No. 6, Feb. 5, 1973, page 91. =Opening titles= The show's opening graphic used each actor's name, zoomed out to form a line drawing of the face of each of the primary stars in turn, with the face each time being formed out of repetitions of the star's name, accompanied by a jazzy, pulsating theme by Dave Grusin. This graphic originally put the featured lead first, then the other two as \\"starring in ...\\", Franciosa set on pale blue background, Barry on red, and Stack on green. All three leads were thus depicted, although usually only one of them actually appeared. Each episode then carried individual credits with the featured lead name \\"in\\" followed by title and guest cast. When the show ran on the Encore Mystery channel between 1996 and 1999, a single \\"Stack‚ÄìBarry‚ÄìFranciosa\\" opening graphic was shown on nearly every episode (except 'Keep The Doctor Away', 'Goodbye Harry', 'The Takeover', and 'The Tradition' which each retained their original correct rotation order respectively). This single graphic also preceded almost all except those four episodes on re-runs which Cozi TV aired in 2014. =Jeff Dillon (Tony Franciosa)= Franciosa's \\"Jeff Dillon\\" segments were \\"current affairs\\" stories that ranged from industrial espionage (\\"The Other Kind of Spy\\"), to medical fraud and malpractice (\\"Keep The Doctor Away\\"), racial tensions (\\"The Black Answer\\"), or shady goings-on in an Army training camp (\\"The Prisoner Within\\"). The charismatic Jeff Dillon was a stylish, charming character with a boyish smile, a razor-sharp mind with an attention to detail, and a dogged persistent investigative style later used by (and subsequently more strongly associated with) the 1970s Mystery Movie character Columbo. Susan Saint James's award-winning character, research assistant \\"Peggy Maxwell,\\" was an ever-present supporting character in the \\"Jeff Dillon\\" segments (except the third-season episode; 'The Enemy Before Us' where Dillon returned to his New York home). She even shared the lead with him on one occasion, in the season two episode \\"The King of Denmark.\\" (in which she had a 'one off' greater starring role but was billed second in the episode credits). =Glenn Howard (Gene Barry)= Barry's \\"Glenn Howard\\" was a cool, self-made businessman who cut an elegant, impeccable, playboy millionaire figure, similar to his longer- running character of Amos Burke in Burke's Law. His tales usually involved big business (\\"The Perfect Image\\") or political intrigue (\\"High Card\\") set in powerful, wealthy circles. Howard also had a small but memorable number of more surreal \\"offbeat\\" escapades, such as \\"Love-In At Ground Zero,\\" in which he was abducted by fanatical hippies and forced to witness their protest mass suicide during a secret chemical weapons test. Other memorable episodes included the spooky \\"Tarot,\\" the wild \\"One of The Girls in Research,\\" and the Western set episode \\"The Showdown.\\" Howard's assistant, \\"Andrew Hill\\" (Cliff Potts), appeared in some first-season episodes. Mark Miller was featured as \\"Ross Craig\\" in some Howard tales. =Dan Farrell (Robert Stack)= Stack's \\"Dan Farrell\\" was a resolute, stern ex-F.B.I. investigator, a righteous figure with a tireless sense of justice, which recalled his previous role as Federal Agent Eliot Ness in The Untouchables. Farrell's character had a tragic edge, unlike his two co-stars, being a widower whose wife's murder was shown, in flashback, in the first-season episode \\"Nightmare,\\" which explained his more serious attitude. His stories were normally crime capers, often unusual types such as spree killers (\\"The Bobby Currier Story\\"), corruption in sport (\\"Brass Ring\\") or \\"televangelism\\" (\\"The Glory Shouter\\"), illegal use of prisoners as slave labor (\\"Chains of Command\\") and crooked charities (\\"Give Till It Hurts\\"). Most Stack episodes concluded with a negative image that transformed into the most recent cover shot of Crime Magazine. Franciosa's departure and replacements Franciosa was apparently fired amid some acrimony from the show's producers during the third season of the show's run, after completing three episodes. His other four contracted rotation stories were taken by guest actors: Robert Culp as Paul Tyler in \\"Cynthia Is Alive and Living in Avalon\\" and \\"Little Bear Died Running,\\" Peter Falk as Lewis Corbett in \\"A Sister from Napoli,\\" and Robert Wagner as Dave Corey in \\"The Man Who Killed a Ghost.\\" These episodes duly created the impression of Howard Publications being a large concern with many top reporters. Franciosa's face was still featured on the opening graphic for season three, with the guest leads billed as, 'Guest Starring in ...', then depicted with photos (from each episode) set on the closing credits as background. According to writer Richard DeRoy, his teleplay for the third-season episode \\"A Capitol Affair\\" was intended to establish Suzanne Pleshette as a new permanent character, gossip columnist Hallie Manville. However, the episode was made towards the very end of the series run (as the 71st of 76 episodes), and Pleshette did not return as Manville in any of the few remaining episodes. The same episode included a role intended for Joan Crawford, but Crawford fell ill and was replaced by Mercedes McCambridge.ClassicTVHistory.com =Continuity= Surprisingly, all three series leads (Tony Franciosa, Gene Barry and Robert Stack) never appeared together in any episode. Barry made brief cameo appearances \\"as Glenn Howard,\\" for series continuity purposes, in four of Stack's episodes ('Nightmare', 'Witness', 'The Bobby Currier Story' and 'High on A Rainbow') and four of Franciosa's first-season episodes ('Fear of High Places', 'Connie Walker', 'Collector's Edition', and 'Shine On Jesse Gil'). Franciosa did likewise \\"as Jeff Dillon\\" in a single first-season Barry segment story, \\"The Taker.\\" However, Stack and Franciosa never appeared in the same episode. Stack's character of Dan Farrell was mentioned by name in the Franciosa episode, \\"Collector's Edition,\\" in which Barry cameoed and Peggy Maxwell phoned Farrell, but he was not seen. This is the closest the show ever came to including all the three leads. Stack never made any cameo appearances in the other two leads' episodes. Barry also cameos in the third season Robert Culp 'subbing' for Franciosa episode; 'Cynthia is Alive...' appearing at the start and end of the episode. Though the producers would have had audiences believe that each actor would appear every third week, in the first season there were eleven Barry segments, nine Stack segments, and only six Franciosa segments. The actual rotating order of the lead actors' episodes was inconsistent over the three seasons; sometimes Barry or Stack appeared for two consecutive weeks running, while it was not unusual for Stack and Barry episodes to alternate repeatedly with no Franciosa story between. Towards the end of season two, there were two Franciosa episodes only two weeks apart, suggesting that the show's original transmission order was possibly rushed. =Casting= Some notable supporting stars included a young, pre-Alias Smith and Jones Ben Murphy as Farrell's assistant Joseph Sample; Cliff Potts as Howard's assistant Andrew Hill, taking a one-off lead role in season one's \\"Pineapple Rose\\" episode. Mark Miller played Howard's other executive assistant Ross Craig, who also appeared in a few Robert Stack segment episodes as well. Darren McGavin took a guest lead as freelance newsman Sam Hardy (in \\"Goodbye Harry\\"), and Vera Miles likewise as Howard's top female reporter, Hilary Vanderman (in \\"Man of The People\\"). These three episodes all featured Gene Barry in cameos and were put under his segment. Other guest stars included (alphabetically): Dana Andrews, Martin Balsam, Anne Baxter, Honor Blackman, Charles Boyer, Rossano Brazzi, Hoagy Carmichael, David Carradine, Ray Charles, Chuck Connors, Joseph Cotten, Broderick Crawford, Nigel Davenport, Sammy Davis, Jr., Yvonne De Carlo, Brandon deWilde, Ivan Dixon, Pete Duel, Sharon Farrell, Barbara Feldon, Jose Ferrer, Steve Forrest, Pamela Franklin, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Sean Garrison, Will Geer, Frank Gorshin, Robert Goulet, Lee Grant, Peter Graves, Julie Harris, Noel Harrison, Burl Ives, Van Johnson, Shirley Jones, Louis Jourdan, Boris Karloff, Jack Kelly, John Kerr, Jack Klugman, Peter Lawford, Dorothy Lamour, Gypsy Rose Lee, Claudine Longet, Kevin McCarthy, Roddy McDowall, Sal Mineo, Ricardo Montalban, Laurence Naismith, Barry Nelson, Leslie Nielsen, Suzanne Pleshette, Pernell Roberts, Simon Scott, William Shatner, Frank Sinatra, Barry Sullivan, Donald Sutherland, Russ Tamblyn, Mel Torme, Ike & Tina Turner, Lurene Tuttle, Jessica Walter, Dionne Warwick, Dennis Weaver, Robert Webber, James Whitmore, Jill Townsend, Brenda Vaccaro, and Robert Young.

It is owned by Family Radio and carries a Christian talk and teaching radio format, along with traditional hymns and worship music. Programming comes from the Family Radio Network, based in Nashville. KECR airs Christian teaching programs from national religious leaders such as RC Sproul, Alistair Begg, Ken Ham, John F. MacArthur, Adriel Sanchez, Dennis Rainey and John Piper. Musical artists include Keith & Kristyn Getty, The Master's Chorale, Fernando Ortega, Chris Rice, Shane & Shane, Sovereign Grace Music and Sara Groves. KECR broadcasts at 5,000 watts, using a directional antenna. The transmitter site is near Moreno Avenue, north of Lakeside, California, near California State Route 67. No local programming originates here, as the station airs the Family Radio Network continuously, except for the station identification. It does however, have a backup radio studio at its transmission site, which is mainly used to carry out messages from the Emergency Alert System. The seven-tower array transmitter site is shared with AM 1170 KCBQ, another Christian Radio station, owned by the Salem Media Group. History =Early years= KDEO (1955-1970) This station signed on in 1955. In its early years, it was a Top 40 station with the call sign KDEO. It used the moniker \\"Radio Kay-dee-oh\\". KDEO was the first radio station to broadcast the countdown program American Top 40 with Casey Kasem, on July 3, 1970.Durkee, Rob. American Top 40: The Countdown of the Century. . New York City: Schirmer Books, 1999, p. 57. Accessed December 10, 2007. The premiere of the program coincided with the Independence Day holiday that year. Magic (1971-1979) By 1971 the station rebranded as Magic 91 (referencing its AM frequency). On March 1, 1977, it switched its call letters to KMJC. The station continued its Top 40 format. The Magic branding would eventually end up on XHRM-FM 92.5 in 1998. =Religious era= Independent (1980-1990) As music migrated to FM radio, the owners decided to adopt a new format. In 1980, KMJC flipped to Christian programming, call letters' meaning to \\"King and Master, Jesus Christ\\" to match the new format. It remained independent from any religious network throughout the 1980s. Acquisition by Family Stations (1990-1994) On April 6, 1990, the call sign became KECH, as Family Stations began operating it. Subsequently, Family proceeded to acquire the station outright 2 years later. When the sale was consummated in 1992, it began airing programming from Family Radio. FM station divestiture (1995-2002) The programs were originally fed from 93.3 KECR-FM, which was soon put up for sale. Family would later change the AM station's call sign to its present KECR call letters when the simulcast ended in 1995. At that point, Jacor Communications acquired the FM station, which subsequently became a CHR station (now KHTS-FM) in 1996. Recent History (2003-Present) During the October 2003 Cedar Fires, part of KECR's rural transmitter site was destroyed by flames. One tower (out of seven) and an electrical shack were completely destroyed. The station transmitter site was repaired and the signal restored. =FM Translator= Family Stations plans to give KECR an FM translator at 100.1 FM. An application was filed on January 28, 2018, as part of a new spectrum auction. On July 3, 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that Family Radio has won the spectrum auction for a fee of $35,000. In order for its construction permit to be issued, Family Radio must finish paying the station's mortgage. This new translator will be located atop Mount San Miguel.

Only Pike hasn't come to catch up with Buffy; he's being pursued by a rock demon known as Grayhewn. Pike had originally killed the demon's mate after it had killed his friend and now the demon wants Pike dead in the most painful way possible.

Plot summary Lately Sunnydale, California has been missing kids, some of them have run away while others seem to have been kidnapped. There have also been attacks by little vicious creatures that completely mutilate their victims by simply biting through their prey. Also in town is a Renaissance Faire and the gang decides to pay it a visit. One visit is enough though because something is slightly off about the faire, everything seems evil and this one boy named Roland is continuously picked on, and not for fun either. After some research and a couple of run-ins with some small attackers, Angel and Rupert Giles discover that a group of mystical beings called the Wild Hunt are in town to claim the souls of humans. Angel warns Buffy Summers not to look at them as if she does they will steal her soul and she will be forced to ride with the Hunt. Buffy hides Roland out in her basement to save him from the nasty Faire people. The next night Buffy comes home to find Roland stolen away by the Wild Hunt. Giles informs Buffy that the Wild Hunt is run by the Erl King, lord of the Wild Hunt, and that Roland is his son and the heir to the Erl King title even though Roland is disgusted by the Hunt.

This can be done manually, by software on the bidder's computer, or by an online sniping service. A bid sniper (often, merely called a sniper) is a person, or software agent, that performs auction sniping.  Usage  Online services claim that their use decreases the failure rate of the snipe, because they have more reliable servers and a faster Internet connection with a less variation in latency, allowing the bid to more reliably be placed close to the deadline. = Strategy = Experienced bidders on online auctions with fixed ending-times often prefer entering bids late in the auction to avoid bidding wars (multiple rounds of bidders each increasing their maximum bid to temporarily regain \\"current highest bid\\" status) or bid chasing (where the presence of an existing bid encourages others to bid on the same item). One economic analysis of sniping suggests that sniping is a rational gain-maximizing (in other words, price-minimizing) strategy for bidders in auctions that fulfill two criteria: # the end time is rigidly fixed # it is possible to gain additional information about the \\"true\\" value of the item by inspecting previous bids For example, a novice antiques buyer may prefer to bid in auctions which already have bids placed by more experienced antiques buyers, on the grounds that the items which the experienced buyers are interested in are more likely to be valuable. In this case, more-informed buyers may delay bidding until the last minutes of the auction to avoid creating competition for their bids, leading to a lower winning bid. An analysis of actual winning bids on eBay suggests that winning bidders are more likely to have placed a single bid late in the auction, rather than to have placed multiple incremental bids as the auction progresses. =Avoidance of maximum bid fishing= Many online auctions use proxy bidding, an iterative sealed bid auction where winners pay a fixed increment over the second highest bid. The auctioneer does not disclose the current maximum bid, but the second highest bid is always public. In proxy bidding, the wise bidder must know in advance the \\"true\\" value of an item as a basis for their secret bidding limit. The fact that the maximum bid is revealed when it is outbid introduces the possibility of maximum bid fishing. Bidders unsure of the value of an item may incrementally increase their bid until they narrowly exceed the previously hidden maximum, thus placing themselves in a winning position without placing a very high bid. Sniping eliminates this possibility and effectively converts the auction to a Vickrey auction, the same as a proxy bidding auction except that all bids are kept secret until the close of bidding. =Shill avoidance= Sniping closes a loophole to fraudulent practice by a shill (an agent for the seller, which may be another account of the seller) to raise the bid to the maximum. They then hope the original bidder will increase their maximum bid even by a small amount to win the auction. The danger to the seller in this case is that the original bidder may not choose to increase their bid, leaving the seller with a futile transaction (selling the item to themselves) which will often still incur a fee from the auction service. Bidding at the last moment prevents a shill bidder from pushing the auction higher, as they have no time to make the incremental bids required. = Simultaneous bidding, without potentially winning multiple bids = Bid sniping can be used when many similar items are available at auction simultaneously, with various ending times, and a bidder only wishes to win one item. Automated bid sniping tools allow for an efficient way to bid on multiple items, up to the maximum price the bidder wishes to pay, without bidding on the actual auction platform itself and potentially winning more than one of the auctions. Once the bidder wins the desired item, they can cancel the other scheduled snipe bids before they are actually placed in the auction system itself. This is not a factor if the auction platform allows bidders to instantly withdraw their bids without reason, but many do not. Increasing the number of similar or identical items bid on, reduces the attachment to winning any one of them. The ability to batch a queue of snipe bids for auctions long in advance and waiting for notification of the win without further management allows for a more efficient use of time. Objections Non-sniping bidders may object to sniping, claiming that it is unfair to place bids at a point when it is impossible or unfeasible for other bidders to evaluate and possibly counter the bid, causing them to lose auctions even though they would have been willing to meet the winning bid amount. Bidders sometimes object to sniping when multiple identical items are listed as a separate lot, or on breakup auctions, where items that constitute a set are broken down and sold separately, as they must wait to find whether their maximum bid on one lot has been exceeded before being in a position to decide whether to bid on another. However, online auction sites, unlike live auctions, usually have an automatic bidding system which allows a bidder to enter their maximum acceptable bid. This is a hidden or proxy bid, known to the system, but not any other bidders; during the auction the actual bid is incremented only enough to beat the existing highest bid. For example, if an item's current maximum high bid is 57 and someone is prepared to pay 100 and bids accordingly, the displayed bid will be 58, with the hidden maximum of 100. The failure of a maximum acceptable bid beaten by a sniper prepared to pay more is not due to the act of sniping, unless the original bidder would have bid higher on seeing their bid exceeded. For this reason, opposition to sniping can be analyzed as more of a subjective reaction to losing an auction for the usual reason of not bidding enough, than a reaction to a \\"dirty trick\\". The beaten bidder would have beaten the sniper if their maximum bid had been more than the sniper was willing to offer. However, if the minimum bid increment is very low, the sorites paradox can come into play, and make it difficult for a person to establish a single maximum bid. For example, if the minimum bid increment on an auction is 10 cents, it can be difficult or impossible for a person to identify a price which they would be willing to pay to win the item but which they would not be willing to exceed by ten cents.  Banning by auction sites  While some people disapprove of auction sniping, it is not forbidden by the rules of many auction sites. For example, it is permitted by eBay. eBay Germany banned automated sniping services in 2002, but the ban was declared illegal by Berlin's County Court, and revoked. Deterrents = CAPTCHAs= One attempt to defeat automated bid sniping software is requiring bidders to pass a CAPTCHA test prior to entering their bid. This ensures that all bids are entered manually. Some software can read some CAPTCHAs, potentially neutralising the protection. =Final extension= Also known simply as \\"anti-snipe\\". Some online auction systems attempt to discourage sniping (manual or automated) by automatically extending the auction time if a last-minute bid is placed. This approach leaves all bidding open, and allows any bidders who are watching during the final few minutes to raise the bid. It can also lead to last-minute automated out-of-control bidding wars between bidders, which can extend the bidding time long beyond what the seller desired, greatly raising the final selling price. Any site which implements a limit to the number of time extensions allowed simply causes a final extension snipe. =Buy It Now= Some auction systems allow buyers to end an auction early by paying a predetermined final price for the item (generally substantially more than the minimum opening bid). This may discourage some sniping because another bidder can simply purchase the item outright while the sniper is waiting for the auction end time, even if a successful snipe bid could win it for substantially less than the Buy It Now price. On eBay the Buy It Now (BIN) option is not intended to deter sniping, and is removed as soon as a bid (exceeding a reserve price, if set) is made.

It shares the common name \\"lilly pilly\\" with several other plants. In New Zealand, it is commonly known as 'monkey apple'. It is planted as shrubs or hedgerows, and features: rough, woody bark; cream and green smooth, waxy leaves; flushes of pink new growth; and white to maroon edible berries. Unpruned, it will grow about tall in the garden. Taxonomy Syzygium smithii 's name dates from its 1789 description as Eugenia smithii by French botanist Jean Louis Marie Poiret, its specific name honouring James Edward Smith,Floyd, Alexander G., Rainforest Trees of Mainland South-eastern Australia, Inkata Press 2008, pp. 265‚Äì66 who had described it two years earlier as E. elliptica. The name was unusable due to that combination having been used for another species. It gained its current binomial name in 1893 when reclassified in the genus Syzygium by German botanist Franz Josef Niedenzu, and since 2009 the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria (CHAH) Australian Plant Census has confirmed the recognition of this current name. The species has been widely known for many years as Acmena smithii, still used in NSW , in Qld currently , and it still occurs today on many older web pages. Common names include lilly pilly, coast satinash, Eungella gum, and in the timber trade, lilipilli satinash. Description Syzygium smithii grows as a tree to high by wide, with a trunk attaining a diameter of . The largest tree was recorded at Dingo Creek Flora Reserve, south of Tenterfield, being tall and a trunk wide.Floyd, Alexander G., Australian Rainforests in NSW, volume 2, Surrey Beatty & Sons 1990, page 176 The trunk is sometimes buttressed. The bark is brown and scaled and flakes off easily. Its dark green shiny leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems, and are lanceolate or ovate and measure . The cream-white flowers appear from October to March, occurring in panicles at the end of small branches. Berries follow on, appearing from May to August, and are oval or globular with a shallow depression at the top. They measure 0.8 to 2 cm in diameter, and range from white to maroon in colour. A distinctive narrow leaved form with thin leaves 3‚Äì6 cm long is found along rainforest riverbanks from Sydney northwards through Queensland, (rheophytic race) and a small leaved form (known as the small-leaved race or var. minor) with leaves measuring 1.6‚Äì6 cm found in dryer rainforests from Colo Heights near Sydney north to the Bunya Mountains. Distribution and habitat Syzygium smithii is found in rainforest from the Windsor Tableland in north-east Queensland south through New South Wales and Victoria to Wilsons Promontory. Associated trees species include bangalow palm (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana), ironwood (Backhousia myrtifolia), black wattle (Callicoma serratifolia), sassafras, (Doryphora sassafras), blueberry ash (Elaeocarpus reticulatus), pinkwood (Eucryphia moorei), sweet pittosporum (Pittosporum undulatum) and kanuka (Tristaniopsis laurina). Stunted coastal plants are often associated with coast banksia (Banksia integrifolia). In New Zealand, where it is known as \\"monkey apple\\", the species has become naturalised in forest and scrub and has been classified as an \\"unwanted organism\\". In the Waikato region, at least, it can outgrow native canopy tree species such as puriri (Vitex lucens) and taraire (Beilschmiedia tarairi), and become the permanent canopy. Ecology Flowers being pollinated by a bee and an ant Berries Flowers of Syzygium smithii (Poir, 1789), Mount Keira, Illawarra region, New South Wales, Australia. Photographed mid-November 2015 The Australian king parrot, crimson rosella, rose-crowned fruit-dove, superb fruit-dove, topknot pigeon, white-headed pigeon, wonga pigeon, satin bowerbird, and pied currawong have all been recorded eating the berries as well as brushtail possums and flying foxes. Ringtail possums also eat fresh leaves. In New Zealand, wood pigeons (kerer≈´) eat the fruit and disperse the seeds. The leaf-mining larvae of the moth species Pectinivalva acmenae feed on the leaves. Other moth larvae that feed on the leaves include the species Agriophara horrida, Cryptophasa pultenae and Macarostola formosa. Cultivation The species was introduced into cultivation as Eugenia elliptica at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew by Sir Joseph Banks in 1790. Syzygium smithii is widely grown in cultivation as a specimen tree. Noted American landscape architect Thomas Church used the species in gardens that he created in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1950s. These were often clipped to shape. The species has also been used as a subject for bonsai. Of the several species grown in cultivation, S. smithii is one of the more resistant to attacks by psyllids. The species can tolerate both full sun and full shade. Established plants withstand dry periods and moderate frost. Syzygium smithii is listed as a fire retardant species by such authorities as Gosford Council NSW, NSW Fire Service and the Country Fire Authority. =Cultivars= A number of forms have been selected for cultivation, including the following: *'Allyn Magic', a compact form of var. minor with greyed-orange new foliage bred by Noel Jupp of East Gresford, New South Wales. *'Elizabeth Isaacs' (also known as 'Variegata'), a slightly smaller cultivar that has new growth flushes with a combination of pink, green, cream and cream-margined leaves. *'Firescreen', a select, fast growing, broad leaf form. Glossy, copper‚Äìred new foliage growth is encouraged by a regular prune and feed, maturing to mid green. Selected for hedging from 1.2 m high, Firescreen has a semi-pendulous, dense habit, a short leaf internode and holds its foliage all the way to the ground. Unpruned height over 6 metres. Can also be used as a pot specimen for topiary or as a standard. Firescreen tolerates full sun to shade, windy conditions, heat waves and cold to -2 ¬∞C and it is psyllid and borer resistant. Bred by Tracey and Stuart Knowland of Bangalow Wholesale Nursery NSW, with plant breeders' rights granted in 2010. *'Hedgemaster' is a compact shrubby form reaching a metre (3 ft) tall and 0.5 m wide. It has a bushy dense habit and small leaves, and can be used in topiary or formal hedging. It was propagated and licensed under plant breeders' rights by television presenter Don Burke [Note: plant breeders rights since terminated]. *'Red Head', a select, broad leaf, compact tree form. Glossy, burgundy-red new foliage is encouraged by a regular prune and feed, maturing to very dark green. Unpruned height 8m+. Selected for compact, bushy form suitable for pleaching, topiary, standards or as a stand-alone tree in urban areas. 'Red Head' tolerates full sun to shade, windy conditions, heat waves and cold to -2deg. 'Red Head' is psyllid and borer resistant. Bred by Tracey and Stuart Knowland of Bangalow Wholesale Nursery NSW, with plant breeders' rights granted in 2010. For best results add organic matter to soil when planting and feed and water regularly until established. The 1889 book The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that Eugenia Smithii was called \\"Tdgerail\\" by the Indigenous people of the Illawarra (New South Wales); and \\"Coochin-coochin\\" by others in Queensland. It also states that the fruits were eaten by the Indigenous Australians and are acidulous, and wholesome.\\" Uses and cultural references J. H. Maiden in 1889 recorded that \\"The fruits are eaten by the aboriginals, small boys, and birds. They are formed in profusion, are acidulous, and wholesome. They are white with a purplish tint, and up to one inch in diameter.\\" The mildly acidic fruit have been described as somewhat lacking in taste. The white to pinkish brown timber is used for flooring, frames and fittings. The character \\"Lilly Pilly\\" (based on the fruit of the tree) who is an actress friend of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, was illustrated by author May Gibbs. The fruit and leaves of Syzigium smithii were featured on a 49c Australian stamp, one of a bush tucker set, in 2002. The stamp was designed by Janet Boschen and titled \\"Lilly-pilly\\".

A flying-spot scanner (FSS) uses a scanning source of a spot of light, such as a high-resolution, high-light-output, low- persistence cathode ray tube (CRT), to scan an image. Usually the image to be scanned is on photographic film, such as motion picture film, or a slide or photographic plate. The output of the scanner is usually a television signal. Basic principle In the case of the CRT-based scanner, as an electron beam is drawn across the face of the CRT it creates a scan that has the correct number of lines and aspect ratio for the format of the signal. The image of this scan is focused with a lens onto the film frame. Its light passes through the image being scanned and is converted to a proportional electrical signal by photomultiplier tube(s), one for each color (red, green, blue), that detects the variations in intensity of the beam spot as it scans across the film, and are converted to proportional electrical signals, one for each of the color channels. Telecines that use a monochrome CRT as the light source can be referred to as flying-spot scanners. The advantage of the FSS technique is that as colour analysis is done after scanning; simple dichroics may be used to split the light to each photomultiplier ‚Äîand there are no registration errors, as would have been introduced by early electronic cameras. Early use The first image of the far side of the Moon, transmitted back to Earth using a flying-spot scanner by Luna 3 in 1959 The U.S. Census Bureau used a flying spot scanner called FOSDIC to digitize census forms stored on microfilm in the 1960s. Historically, flying-spot scanners were also used as primitive live-action studio cameras at the dawn of electronic television, in the 1920s. A projector equipped with a spinning perforated Nipkow disc created the spot that scanned the stage. Scanning a subject this way required a completely dark stage, and was impractical for production use, but gave early researchers a way to generate live images before practical imaging pickup tubes were perfected. DuMont Vitascan Flying-spot scanner technology was later implemented by DuMont Laboratories in the Vitascan color television system, released in 1956. Vitascan produced NTSC color video using a camera that acted in reverse by housing the flying-spot CRT which was projected through the camera's lens and illuminated the subject in a special light-tight studio. The light from the CRT camera was then picked up by special \\"scoops\\" housing 4 photomultiplier tubes (2 for red, 1 for green, and 1 for blue), which then would provide video of the talent in the studio. Unlike earlier FSS systems that relied on the studio being entirely darkened, Vitascan used a special strobe light would illuminate the studio for the talent's convenience, and would turn on during the photomultiplier scoop's blanking interval pulses, so as not to interfere with the scanning. Broadcast use Flying-spot scanners were used to scan both still print sides and motion picture film for both broadcast TV and later Post-production use. Flying-spot slide scanners were used for Station identification picture and to turn Test film into test TV pictures. There would be a slide changer like on slide projectors to change the slide. radiomuseum.org, Slide scanner Flying-spot Motion picture film scanners were used since the early days of TV.

Wells, founder of the Alpha Suffrage Club The Alpha Suffrage Club was the first and most important black female suffrage club in Chicago and one of the most important in Illinois. It was founded on January 30, 1913 by Ida B. Wells with the help of her white colleagues Belle Squire and Virginia Brooks. The Club aimed to give a voice to African American women who had been excluded from national suffrage organizations such as the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Its stated purpose was to inform black women of their civic responsibility and to organize them to help elect candidates who would best serve the interests of African Americans in Chicago. The club was formed after women in Chicago were granted the right to vote in the year 1910. It fought against the white Chicago women who were trying to ban African Americans from voting altogether. They also wanted to promote the election of African Americans to public office. As Wells stated in her autobiography, \\"we (women) could use our vote for the advantage of ourselves and our race.\\" Quoted in the Chicago Defender, a local black newspaper, she was more specific, stating that the object of the Alpha Suffrage Club was to make women \\"strong enough to help elect some conscientious race man as alderman.\\" Besides focusing on women's newly gained civil duty to vote, Wells also encouraged these women to ensure that their husbands were taking seriously their responsibility to vote as well, recognizing the \\"sacredness\\" of the vote to both sexes. At the first anniversary of the club's founding, Kentucky-born poet Bettiola Heloise Fortson, vice-president of the Club, read her poem \\"Brothers\\" which told the story of two men who had been lynched by a mob for their attempt to save their sister from her imprisonment by a farmer in Alabama as a slave.  Historical context  1913, the year in which the club was founded, was a time still rife with Jim Crow laws and casual discrimination. Black women were subservient to men and other White women and denied education and social mobility. They were also confined to social expectations such as taking on domestic responsibilities and working on the farms if necessary. They were also unprotected by laws even when they were abused and rape by men. Lynching was also common and they denied African American women any chance to prove their innocence from false claims. This fueled the movement founded by Ida B. Wells-Barnett. Wells declared that an inherent problem to black women was the fact that they were overall less invested in gaining the vote because the men and churches of their communities had not supported it. Once they did receive the right to vote, \\"nobody had attempted to instruct them in voting\\". The Alpha Suffrage Club attempted to amend this through means like canvassing neighborhoods and registering black women to vote. African American women as a whole were stretched between civil rights movements: black men who had already gained the right to vote wanted them to stop focusing on suffrage and concentrate their efforts on issues surrounding race, while white suffragettes wanted the opposite. Neither group considered that black women's lives were affected by both their sex and their race. = White suffrage conflict = African Americans voting in 1945 In the early years of the women's suffrage movement, abolition was something that brought many people together. Abolition and women's rights supporters worked together from the conclusion of the Civil War until the late 1800s. Frederick Douglass even used the famous abolitionist newspaper, the North Star, to advertise the 1848 Seneca Falls suffrage meeting. The American Equal Rights Association was formed in 1866 to win suffrage for all. This organization supported both women's and African American's voting rights at first, but with the passing of the 14th and 15th Amendments, there was a change in the group dynamics. Instead of this one organization, in 1868 there were two groups that had differing opinions about black men being given the right to vote. Black women were members of both groups for a time and then racism became a tool that many suffrage groups channeled. As time went on, the main goal of the movement became the right to vote and in order to gain broad support throughout the United States, they used black voting rights as a type of scapegoat. Southern women were especially opposed to these Black suffragettes and still held the belief that African Americans were inferior. Ida B. Wells, one of the founders of the Alpha Suffrage Club, was told she could only participate in the black section of the Woman Suffrage Parade because she was an African American woman. Despite the opposition, Wells still joined the white women marching and fighting for suffrage that day. About a year later Wells founded a suffrage club that supported all women in the pursuit of the right to vote. Her organization advocated suffrage for all women, no matter their race or class, which was something that other popular woman suffrage groups did not push for at that time. The movement became divided, with one part of the movement supporting women's suffrage for all women and the other side only supporting white women suffrage. Women like Ida B. Wells felt that not granting all people the right to vote would hurt the overall cause and therefore the Alpha Suffrage Club supported all people's suffrage. This group distinction caused much conflict for ultimately no reason. The 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920 and granted suffrage to all women no matter their race, economic standing, or class. So although there was racism in the early fight for women's vote, the law produced was not discriminatory. = Woman Suffrage Procession of 1913 = Woman Suffrage Procession, 1913 The Woman Suffrage Procession took place in Washington D.C. on March 3, 1913, the day before the inauguration of Woodrow Wilson. Its intent was to demonstrate support of universal suffrage for women. One of Wells' first actions as the President of the Alpha Suffrage Club was to travel to Washington and march in the parade along with 65 club members, black women from Illinois. The constraints placed on their participation in the event illustrate the discrimination black women faced in the suffrage movement at that time. The National American Woman Suffrage Association, which organized the event, feared offending southern white suffragists by allowing black and white women to march together. To avoid this possibility, the leader of the NAWSA instructed Wells to march at the end of the procession in a segregated section for African-American women. Wells refused to do as march organizers requested. Although Grace Wilbur Trout, the Chair of the Illinois delegation, warned Wells that her involvement in the march could lead to the exclusion of the Illinois group from the parade, she insisted that she would not move to the back, stating that \\"I shall not march at all unless I can march under the Illinois banner.\\" Wells wanted to show the entire country that they were progressive enough to allow women of all races to stand against the hypocrisy of NAWSA's policies. However, no one listened to her except for Belle Squire and Virginia Brooks, two of her white colleagues. Ida B. Wells in the suffrage parade, 1913 Brooks and Squire ended up joining Wells-Barnett in protesting the segregation by race. The women offered to march with their friend at the back of the parade. In defiance, she joined the spectators until the Chicago delegation marched by and then joined them in the procession. A picture of this occurrence was in the Chicago Daily Tribune. A reporter happened to be standing at the spot when Wells-Barnett stepped out of the crowd and into the procession. However, only Wells-Barnett and not the other dozens of black women from Illinois marched with the Illinois delegation. The rest of the Alpha Suffrage Club marched at the back with the other black delegates, which included Delta Sigma Theta sisters and Mary Church Terrell. The club paid for all of Wells' expenses to make it possible for her to march.  Beliefs  The Alpha Suffrage Club had many beliefs and ideals that other suffrage groups lacked. The group was founded on the basic principle that all women, no matter their race, should receive the right to vote along with the men. There were other groups advocating for women's right to vote, but there was a lack of support for colored women suffrage.Dow, Bonnie J. ‚ÄúHistorical Narratives, Rhetorical Narratives, and Woman Suffrage Scholarship.‚Äù Rhetoric & Public Affairs, Volume 2, Number 2, Summer 1999, pp. 321-340 (Review), Michigan State University Press. Project Muse Database. They were of the opinion that to fully enjoy suffrage equally, it was important to be involved in political happenings. Their Chicago-based group played an active role in legislation on voting, equality, and other civil rights matters. They supported philanthropy efforts in their community in order to strengthen colored people's standing in the city of Chicago. They were early supporters of equality for colored people on many levels. Ida B. Wells preached that the right to vote was not being properly used by men once equal suffrage was achieved. Now that suffrage was given to both men and women, their goal was to maximize the vote.Democrat and Chronicle. Says Woman‚Äôs Task Is to See Man Uses Vote. Rochester, New York. 8 Oct 1920. (pg 22) They wanted equality and they wanted empowerment for colored women. Besides universal suffrage, the club also fought for racial equality in other areas. They questioned why brave soldiers had to be seen by race instead of by their deeds.  Illinois Equal Suffrage Act  Wells-Barnett formed the Alpha Suffrage Club in direct response seeing white women \\"working like beavers\\" to pass an Illinois granting limited suffrage to women in the State. Soon after returning from the Washington parade, Wells-Barnett led a congregation of several hundred black women through Springfield's Capitol building to lobby on behalf of the Illinois Equal Suffrage Act and against a handful of pending Jim Crow bills. The IESA was signed into law on June 26, 1913 making Illinois the first state in decades to grant suffrage. Carrie Chapman Catt wrote that \\"suffrage sentiment doubled over night\\". Combined with the successful Suffrage Parade of 1913 and ongoing Silent Sentinels protest, Illinois' bold step for suffrage reinvigorated the national push for a suffrage amendment. A motorcar parade in Chicago celebrated the landmark legislation. On July 1, Wells-Barrnett was a parade marshall, riding with her daughter Alfreda down Michigan Avenue, but this honor was only noted in the Chicago Defender. Her prominent roll went unremarked in the other Chicago papers. The IESA was the result of lobbying by national and local suffrage organizations and clubs. Social clubs at the time were strictly segregated by race and ethnicity. As one historian has noted, ‚ÄúClub women in Chicago established the most and largest gender-segregated suffrage clubs in the nation.\\" The exclusion of black women motivated Wells and Squire to create the Alpha Suffrage Club in 2nd Ward, which had the highest percentage of African Americans in the city. It held at least one meeting at Bridewell Penitentiary in an attempt to interest prisoners in suffrage and give Club women experience in activism. The club had nearly 200 members in 1916, including well-known female suffrage activists Mary E. Jackson, Viola Hill, Vera Wesley Green, and Sadie L. Adams. Jane Addams was a regular speaker at the club. As a result of the IESA, Illinois women were allowed to vote for presidential electors, mayor, aldermen and most other local offices. They were not, however, allowed to vote for members of Congress, Governor or State representatives, as universal suffrage for these offices required amending the state constitution.  Election of Oscar De Priest  The Alpha Suffrage Club played an active and important role in Chicago politics, particularly in the primaries and 1915 general election for alderman in 2nd Ward. The Club developed a block system to canvas the ward to register African American Women to vote. ASC's efforts in 1914 registered 7,290 women in a ward with 16,237 registered men. In an early primary election the Club supported the independent black candidate William R. Cowen, who was not endorsed by the city Republican Party. Despite the canvassing efforts by African-American women on his behalf, he lost the election by only 352 votes. The Alpha Suffrage Club's influence, however, was quickly acknowledged by the press with the Chicago Defender, reporting that ‚Äú. . .the women‚Äôs vote was a revelation to everyone...‚Äù In addition to press coverage, the Republican Party had noticed the Club's influence. It sent two delegates to the club's meeting the day following the election, and encouraged the women to keep campaigning. They also promised that the Republicans would support an African-American candidate in the election of the next year. After the primary election members of the club continued their work. They focused on communities with large percentages of African-Americans as they canvassed neighborhoods. They also held weekly meetings to discuss civic responsibilities, showed women how to use voting machines and trained women to act as precinct judges. They also distributed lists of voting locations in all wards of the city. In the course of their organizing, the women's efforts met significant criticism. Men ‚Äújeered at them and told them they ought to be at home taking care of the babies.‚Äù Others accused them of ‚Äútrying to take the place of men and wear the trousers.‚Äù Local newspapers stated their concerns of the women's door to door canvassing and the prospect of women ‚Äúseeing all of the activities that might be going on.‚Äù After the Club's success in the 1914 primary, the Republican Party designated Oscar De Priest, as their candidate in the 2nd Ward, in the later city election for alderman. He ran against two white candidates and won. As the first black alderman in Chicago he was elected in 1914 to the Chicago City Council, and served from 1915 to 1917. The impact of the Club's organizing was clear, as one third of the votes he received were cast by women. De Priest and the Club had come to know each other well through his attending Club meetings throughout the elections. After his election De Priest acknowledged the work done by the women in the 2nd Ward who had been important in his success. News of the Club's success traveled beyond the city. A black Indianapolis paper proudly reported on the election \\"of a Negro for alderman\\" due \\"in no small part\\" to the 1,093 votes cast by black women. De Priest served only one term as alderman after allegations of corruption, but De Priest's career continued and he later became the first African American to be elected to the U.S. Congress post-reconstruction era. However the influence of ACS in the Second Ward remained strong. Another black Alderman, Louis B. Anderson, succeeded De Priest cementing a change in Chicago's second ward.  Alpha Suffrage Record  Volume 1 of the Alpha Suffrage Record The Alpha Suffrage Club published the newsletter, the Alpha Suffrage Record, which was used to announce the formation of the Club, to describe its activities and to extend its reach a larger group of African Americans in the city. It focused on the population of the 2nd Ward in the city, and gave the Club women a public political voice.  Impacts of the Alpha Suffrage Club  The woman suffrage parade of 1913 legitimized the woman suffrage movement as a whole. The Alpha Suffrage Club and its protest against being forced to march in the back brought a spotlight to the fact that racism was also an issue even within an otherwise united movement. NAWSA wanted to secure white woman suffrage before moving on to African Americans, but the Alpha Suffrage Club and other suffrage associations pushed against that idea, and as a result the 19th amendment granted voting rights to all women, regardless of race. The credibility of the club was recognized after the primary elections in 1914, when Republican delegates attended a club meeting and promised to choose a black nominee in exchange for the women's support in future campaigns. The crucial role the club played in electing Oscar DePriest yielded his support for women's voting rights, buoying the club's causes in the ensuing years, furthering their efforts to back their social reforms with political power. Locally, the Alpha Suffrage Club started a system to canvas neighborhoods and increase community engagement through weekly meetings to educate people on their rights as a citizen. They were also able to register female voters through block by block canvassing. The protests and demonstrations efforts made by the club also brought pressure for the U.S. Congress to approve the 19th amendment on June 10, 1919, which came into effect on August 18, 1920.

A member of the Whig Party, he represented Florida as a U.S. Senator from 1849 to 1855. He also served as a Deputy from Florida to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1862. Early life and education Morton was born in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. He was the brother of Jeremiah Morton, a U.S. Representative from Virginia. Jackson Morton attended Washington College (present-day Washington and Lee University) and the College of William and Mary. He moved to Santa Rosa County, Florida, in 1820 and engaged in the lumber business. Political career In 1836, Morton became a member of the Florida Territorial Legislative Council and served as its president in 1837. In 1838, he was a delegate to the state constitutional convention for the first Florida Constitution. He was a United States Navy agent in Pensacola from 1841 to 1845. In 1848, he was a presidential elector on the Whig Party ticket. Morton was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1848. He served in the Senate from 1849 to 1855 when he was no longer a candidate for reelection and resumed his lumber business. As the division over slavery grew between northern and southern states, Morton became active in the development of the Confederacy. On November 30, 1860, he was chosen to represent Santa Rosa County as a delegate of the Florida Secession Convention in Tallahassee. On January 7, 1861, he was appointed to be part of a twelve-person committee to prepare an Ordinance of Secession for Florida.Florida In The Civil War, Chapter 1 Morton and George Taliaferro Ward attempted to have the ordinance amended so that Florida would not secede until Georgia and Alabama seceded and so that popular ratification would be required. They were overruled on January 8, 1861, and the ordinance went to a vote as planned.Freedom First Morton voted in favor of secession and, on January 10, 1861, by a vote of 62-7, Florida became the third state to leave the United States. On January 17, 1861, Morton was appointed to be a delegate to the Montgomery Convention for constructing a provisional Confederate government. On February 4, 1861, the delegates met and drafted the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States which was signed by Morton and the rest of the delegates four days later. The delegates at this convention became the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. He served for the duration of the Provisional Congress and, in the month following the Provisional Constitution, he also signed its successor, the Confederate States Constitution. Morton and Augustus Maxwell were the only people to represent Florida in both the United States Congress and the Confederate States Congress.

Bundesliga, the DFB-Pokal (German Cup), and the then third division Regionalliga. The scandal has been described as the largest controversy in German football since the Bundesliga scandal of the early 1970s, as numerous players, coaches and officials have been accused of involvement with an organised crime group in the scheme, which came on the eve of Germany playing host to the 2006 World Cup. Although it does not appear that any Bundesliga games were involved, the matches in question do include a DFB Cup first-round contest between regional side SC Paderborn and Bundesliga heavyweights Hamburger SV played on 21 August 2004. Hamburg lost 2‚Äì4 as two highly questionable penalties were awarded to Paderborn and Hamburg footballer √âmile Mpenza was sent off for protesting as the club was eliminated from the lucrative competition. Overview Four referees ‚Äì Lutz Michael Fr√∂hlich, Olaf Blumenstein, Manuel Gr√§fe, and Felix Zwayer ‚Äì went to officials of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fu√üball-Bund, DFB) with their suspicions about Hoyzer. Initially, the DFB did not immediately act, but after becoming aware of the accusations, Hoyzer stepped down from his role as a referee. Indications are that Hoyzer had regular meetings in Berlin with a group of three brothers who were part of a Croatian gambling syndicate connected to an organized crime group. After a confession from Hoyzer, several suspects were put under surveillance and on 28 January 2005 a number of people were arrested. Milan ≈†apina, operator of the Caf√© King sports betting agency and his brother Philip were taken into custody, along with Hertha BSC players Alexander Madlung, Nando Rafael and Josip ≈†imuniƒá. Madlung, Rafael, and ≈†imuniƒá all played in Hertha's surprising 3‚Äì2 defeat to third-division side Eintracht Braunschweig in their 22 September 2004 German Cup match, with Madlung giving up a crucial 80th minute own goal, only four minutes after coming on as a substitute. The trio came under suspicion for having been known to associate with the ≈†apina brothers, but there has been no proof that they actually participated in the manipulation of this or any other match. As witnesses against Hoyzer, the Berlin referees Lutz Michael Fr√∂hlich and Manuel Gr√§fe were immediately relieved of their officiating responsibilities for their own safety, being replaced by Franz- Xaver Wack and Torsten Kinh√∂fer. The referees scheduled to officiate matches in the 19th round of Bundesliga play on 29 and 30 January 2005 were all changed the day before the games were played. Hoyzer co-operated with investigators in helping to uncover the details of the scheme, implicating other officials, players, and a group of Croatian-based gamblers. This led to an investigation by the league, as well as a criminal investigation. By the end of 2005, it appeared that the scandal did not directly involve the Bundesliga and was confined to lower divisions. The investigations lead to the following results: *Hoyzer was banned for life from any role in football and received a 2-year-5-month prison sentence. Jail sentences for Hoyzer and five other defendants were confirmed in December 2006 after they had lost their final appeals in court. *Referee Dominik Marks was banned for life and received a 1-year-6-month sentence for his involvement. *The three Croatian brothers orchestrating the scheme received sentences ranging from 2-year-11-month in prison to 1 year ‚Äì suspended. *Referee Felix Zwayer was banned for 6 months for his involvement including accepting a ‚Ç¨300 bribe from Hoyzer. *Referee Torsten Koop received a three-month ban for not promptly reporting an approach from Hoyzer. *Matches involving officials and players accused or convicted for their involvement in the scheme were subject to review by the league. *Hamburger SV received compensation worth up to ‚Ç¨2 million for its forced early exit from the DFB Cup and compensation for certain other teams affected was arranged. *After review, replays have been ordered for a number of lower division games, while other results will stand. *A number of changes have been put in place or proposed to ensure closer oversight of referees and other game officials. *Once the criminal issues involved have been resolved, it is expected that a number of civil suits will arise as some clubs and individuals seek compensation for harm suffered as a result of the scandal. Response of the DFB The DFB-Kontrollausschuss (DFB Committee of Control) reacted to the scandal with a number of measures intended to prevent similar incidents in the future: * The committee originally intended to follow the UEFA practice of designating game officials on just two days' notice before the match, rather than on the existing schedule of four days' notice. This suggestion was abandoned as impractical. * Referees who are promoted to officiate in second-division games will first be observed over a three-year period in the Regionalliga. * Previously, matches involving Bundesliga teams in the German Cup had not been subject to observation by an arbitrator, but will be in the future. This fourth official will be certified for first division matches and able to act as a substitute game official on short notice if required. * Substitutions may be made for the two junior game officials on the day of the match at the direction of league officials. * Video replays will be used more extensively in future. * Where a potential problem has been identified with game officials, all those involved may be subject to an immediate interim suspension under the \\"Betradar\\" early warning system until the issue is resolved. * The DFB is proposing to offer its own sports betting program for the league in 2006‚Äì07 in order to have some control and oversight of the popular and lucrative sideline. * There is some consideration of responsibility for the selection of game officials being put into the hands of the DFL (Deutsche Fu√üball Liga or German Football League), the governing body responsible for all of German football, rather than leaving this to the control of individual leagues. These measures are regarded as an immediate first step taken to manage the problem of match-fixing. Other more detailed proposals will be put forward by an expert committee appointed to address the issue. On 13 February 2005, the DFB announced the Ausschuss f√ºr das Problem Spielmanipulationen (Commission for the Problem of Match Manipulation) as being made up of DFB President Zwanziger, DFL President Hackmann, Treasurer Schmidhuber, and Secretary General Horst Schmidt. The DFL is also considering a departure from tradition by employing professional officials in place of the amateurs now used. DFL President Werner Hackmann sees the controversial step as possible in light of the recent scandal. The former chairman of the board of Hamburger SV feels that the use of full-time referees earning a good wage could help deflect bribery attempts in the future. Former star player and head of Germany's 2006 FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee Franz Beckenbauer expressed opposition to the idea of employing professional officials feeling that the current system has worked quite well and is solidly supported by the excellent training program run by the DFB. The former FIFA referee Hellmut Krug, DFB Director of Officials (Schiedsrichterabteilung) criticized the control system the DFB had in place because it had been known for some time that Hoyzer was making dubious decisions, but there was no action taken. He also emphasized the more general need for observers to prepare written match reports as is the practise for all Bundesliga matches.  The scandal and the 2006 World Cup  There was some fear that the scandal affecting the largest football association in the world could have some negative impact on the upcoming World Cup to be hosted by Germany in 2006. While World Cup Organising Committee chief Franz Beckenbauer expressed his concern, government spokesman Thomas Steg acknowledged the efforts of the DFB in acting in a committed manner in quickly dealing with the issue. A spokesman for Germany's Ministry of the Interior warned against an atmosphere of general suspicion and exaggerated mistrust given what appeared to be, on investigation, the narrow scope of the problem. It was felt that the response to the scandal by the DFB demonstrated the general effectiveness of the sport's governing institutions. Interior Minister Otto Schily also encouraged all game officials to support the DFB and public prosecutor's office in quickly addressing any suspicions raised. He indicated that it was clear that the vast majority of officials conduct themselves in an honest and professional manner and that to be generally suspicious of the game's officials without cause would be unfair. The scandal attracted international media attention, but DFB and FIFA worked aggressively to ensure that the controversy died down before the 2006 World Cup. Affected matches In the course of the investigation by the DFB a number of matches were examined to determine if there was an attempt to manipulate them and if any such attempt had affected the outcome. The matches and their relevant detail are listed below in chronological order. The DFB set a cut off date of 30 June 2005 for filing protests over matches that may have been subject to attempted manipulation. While Hoyzer had drawn the suspicion of a number of his fellow officials sometime earlier, it was the 21 August 2004 match between SC Paderborn 07 and Hamburger SV that precipitated the complaint to the DFB against him. *30 May 2004 Wuppertaler SV ‚Äì Werder Bremen Amateure 1‚Äì0 :This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Hoyzer. There was no determination of manipulation. Bremen did not file a protest as the result did not materially affect their standing in the league table. The match was not replayed and the result left to stand. *5 June 2004 Eintracht Braunschweig ‚Äì FC St. Pauli 3‚Äì2 :This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Hoyzer. There was a determination of manipulation, but because the season was completed by the time the determination was made the match was not replayed and the result left to stand. Negotiations are underway to arrange compensation for St. Pauli. *11 August 2004 VfL Wolfsburg Amateure ‚Äì Fortuna D√ºsseldorf 1‚Äì1 :This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Hoyzer. There was no determination of manipulation. The match was not replayed and the result left to stand. * 13 August 2004 Hertha BSC Amateure ‚Äì Arminia Bielefeld Amateure 2‚Äì1 :This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Dominik Marks. Hoyzer testified that Marks received payment to attempt to manipulate the outcome. The contest was replayed near the end of the season on 12 April 2005 with Berlin repeating their victory, this time by a score of 6:0. No other compensation was ordered. *14 August 2004 FC St. Pauli ‚Äì VfL Osnabr√ºck 2‚Äì3 :This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Hoyzer. There was no determination of manipulation. The match was not replayed and the result left to stand. *21 August 2004 SC Paderborn 07 ‚Äì Hamburger SV 4‚Äì2 :This opening round German Cup match was refereed by Hoyzer who admitted to attempting to influence the outcome of the game by awarding a number of unjustified penalties against Hamburg. HSV striker Emile Mpenza was sent off for protesting calls. The obviously questionable nature of the calls in this match caused a number of Hoyzer's fellow officials to complain to the German Football Association which led to the opening of the investigations that revealed the scandal. :By the time the fix was revealed several more Cup rounds had been played and Paderborn had been eliminated. The match was not be replayed and Mpenza's red card was rescinded. HSV was awarded ‚Ç¨500,000 in compensation and was also to be awarded a Germany international match at the club's home ground which could generate an additional ‚Ç¨1.5 million in revenue. *27 August 2004 Rot-Weiss Essen ‚Äì FC Rot-Wei√ü Erfurt 0‚Äì0 :This 2. Bundesliga match was refereed by Hoyzer. There was no determination of manipulation. The match was not replayed and the result left to stand. *21 September 2004 1. FC N√ºrnberg ‚Äì LR Ahlen 2‚Äì3 :This opening round German Cup match was refereed by Hoyzer. There was no determination of manipulation. The match was not replayed and the result left to stand. *26 September 2004 MSV Duisburg ‚Äì SpVgg Greuther F√ºrth 1‚Äì0 :This 2. Bundesliga match was refereed by Hoyzer and a protest was filed by F√ºrth. It was determined that there was an attempt to manipulate the match, but that the attempt did not affect the outcome. The match was not replayed and the result left to stand. *22 October 2004 LR Ahlen ‚Äì SV Wacker Burghausen 1‚Äì0 :This 2. Bundesliga match was refereed by Hoyzer who admitted to manipulating the match by awarding Ahlen a questionable penalty. The match was replayed near the end of the season on 27 April 2005 with Burghausen able to reverse the result with a 3‚Äì1 win. The outcome did not otherwise materially affect the standing of the two clubs in the league table. No other compensation was ordered. *6 November 2004 KFC Uerdingen 05 ‚Äì VfL Osnabr√ºck 1‚Äì4 :This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Hoyzer. There was no determination of manipulation. The match was not replayed and the result left to stand. *28 November 2004 SpVgg Unterhaching ‚Äì 1. FC Saarbr√ºcken 1‚Äì3 :This 2. Bundesliga match was refereed by Hoyzer who admitted to manipulating the game by awarding Unterhaching a questionable penalty. The penalty which could have tied the match at 2‚Äì2 was missed. The attempt to manipulate the game did not affect its outcome and the result was left to stand. No other compensation was ordered. *3 December 2004 Karlsruher SC ‚Äì MSV Duisburg 0‚Äì3 :This 2. Bundesliga was refereed by Dominik Marks. Hoyzer testified that Marks received payment to attempt to manipulate the outcome. KSC filed a protest over the result. While it was determined that there was an attempt to manipulate the match, it was judged that the attempt did not affect the outcome. The match was not replayed and the result left to stand.

Plot summary Taking place during Buffy's third season, Faith and Buffy are the current Slayers. When mayhem caused by tidal waves and burning forests begin to erupt in Sunnydale as well as vicious attackers appearing with ceremonial axes, the gang knows that something is up. A woman named Cecile Lafitte has sent her Servants to kill the Slayers with special axes, Faith being the Slayer of Fire and Buffy being the Slayer of Air. Each Slayer has a special axe made to destroy the Slayer of that particular element. There are four axes in total; air, fire, water and earth. Should Faith and Buffy both be killed then it's believed that the line of Slayers would die out forever. Cecile wants to bring forth the Gatherer, and the only way to do so is to have the Slayers killed, which would feed the demon enough power to bring him forth into the world. Meanwhile, Willow ends up in the hospital with major brain trauma while Giles figures they need answers from the Watcher of the Slayer that preceded Buffy, India Cohen. During the final confrontation with the Gatherer, Willow and Cordelia briefly serve as hosts for India (the Slayer of Water) and Kendra (the Slayer of Earth) respectively. Eventually with the help of the spirits of the former Slayers, Lucy Hanover and the spirits that live in the woods where the battle takes place, the group defeats the Gatherer and destroys it by each absorbing parts of its soul.

It was later collected together in one omnibus paperback. Each was published by Pocket Books __TOC__ The Lost Slayer I: Prophecies =Description= As Buffy is starting out her freshman year at UC Sunnydale she decides to take charge and do everything herself. How else can she hope to have a normal life without mastering everything she does? But unfortunately it results in isolation from her friends and angers Willow, who tries to understand but to no avail. When a particularly nasty group of vampires with bats tattooed across their faces with eyes that glow with a surreal orange fire arrive in Sunnydale, Buffy tries her best to keep them at bay. Giles researches to find out that this particular breed of vampires are a group of followers who are led by and worship the deity Camazotz. Things start to look even worse when the past Slayer Lucy Hanover visits Buffy in her sleep. After a run-in with Camazotz where Giles gets captured and most of the Scooby Gang ends up injured, Buffy decides to call on Lucy Hanover to help them out. Lucy then calls on the Prophet who tells Buffy that her mistake has already been made. As the Prophet touches Buffy she is thrown 5 years into the future where she's been locked in a cage for the past five years. =Continuity= *This book establishes an alternate timeline in season four. The Lost Slayer II: Dark Times =Description= Buffy, now 24 years old, has been locked in her prison for the past 5 years. One day her captors finally throw the new Slayer, August, in there with her; Faith was killed a few months ago. The confused girl tries to kill Buffy, reasoning that this is the only way to ensure that there's a Slayer active outside, but Buffy accidentally snaps her spine, killing her. Buffy finally escapes from her prison when the guards arrive after the scuffle. She flees into Sunnydale and finds to her surprise that someone has left her old crossbow for her in an old drive-in where she also makes some wooden stakes by breaking up chairs. Once escaped, she finds out that Sunnydale has been taken over by vampires with humans helping them out of fear (although there are some, like Parker Abrams, who actually enjoy their new roles in life). After a call to the Watcher's Council and a fight with various vampires (Including Harmony, Drusilla and Spike, all of whom but Spike are killed), Buffy meets up with the extraction team which includes (among others) Willow, who is now a powerful sorceress; Xander, now a grim and humorless man; and Oz, who can change into a werewolf whenever he chooses. Thanks to the extraction team, Buffy escapes. In the present, Buffy has been possessed by the Prophet. Once Willow has found this out, they realize they need to prevent Buffy's body from leaving Sunnydale. While the Prophet is leaving Sunnydale, Camazotz appears, tears the entity out of Buffy's body, and destroys it. The Prophet is actually Zotziloha, Camazotz's wife, who was attempting to hide in the Slayer's body. After the fight Buffy is captured and imprisoned, the reasoning being that the only way to stop the Slayer is to imprison her; otherwise another Slayer will just be activated. This is done on the orders of Giles, who is now a vampire. He spares Buffy's friends, but more because they are not important than any lingering emotion towards them. In the future, Buffy is informed that Giles is not only a vampire, he's become the king of the vampires, the one who rules the future Sunnydale and was responsible for her imprisoning. Future Giles is the threat that everyone fears in the future. =Continuity= *The alternate timeline moves five years into a possible future. The Lost Slayer III: King of the Dead =Description= Giles has become the king of vampires and even Spike is under his rule. Drusilla is dead and Spike seeks revenge on Giles who was the one who sent Drusilla out to kill the Slayer. After Giles casts him out from his lair, Spike immediately goes to the human headquarters. Meanwhile, Buffy is trying to reacquaint herself with all of her friends... or at least they used to be her friends. Her twin spirits are confused by the changes she'd had to go through and finds it difficult to accept that the future is so different; Joyce and Anya are dead, Wesley is the Watcher for the latest Slayer, and Angel vanished five years ago when he tried to rescue Buffy. Spike shows up looking to let Buffy in on everything he knows, but he's caught as a priest, Father Lonergan, can sense vampires and senses him coming allowing Buffy to capture him. After finding out that Spike was the one that killed her mom, Buffy tortures him for information, but it's Xander who finally stakes him, in Anya's honour after they learn everything they need to know from him. The information they learn is disturbing: not only does Giles now rule Sunnydale and nearby El Surte, he's working on LA too and due to his methodical plans, he will succeed if not stopped. Meanwhile, Giles- who is capable of predicting all of Buffy's moves in a confrontation- has plans for Buffy; he plans to make her a vampire so that she could be by his side once again. He sneaks into the Council base and during the confrontation reveals he helped Buffy escape her prison and was the one that left her that crossbow as he wanted to test her reflexes. After Buffy fails to kill him (more out of lingering emotion towards her old friend and mentor than anything else), he leaves. The next day, Buffy, now taking command of the Council's forces, leads a massive attack on Sunnydale with the purpose of finding and killing Giles in order to end his reign. An army of Council forces marches on the town to liberate it with Buffy and her friends leading an attack directly on City Hall while other groups go to other sites around town that are vampire nests to eliminate them. The book ends during the attack on City Hall when Buffy and her friends investigate the basement and find the long-missing Camazotz now a prisoner of Giles and little more than a battery for his Kakchiquels, several of whom are feeding on him. As the book ends, the group is noticed by the feeding vampires and the now insane Camazotz. =Continuity= *Follows continuity established in Lost Slayer Volume I and II. *Reference is made to the Initiative, with one of the Council commenting that the government had a secret organisation in Sunnydale dedicated to the study of demons. The Lost Slayer IV: Original Sins =Description= Buffy, Xander and Willow have found a weakened and insane Camazotz which they accidentally release from his magical chains. Willow figures out how to kill Camaztoz: with gold, through alchemy which can only be done if it's not used for personal gain. Willow is able to create a golden crossbow bolt and kill Camazotz with it. Meanwhile, Anna, the new Slayer, and Wesley try to reduce the vampire population though Wesley gets seriously injured. Now that Camazotz is dead, the Kakchiquels have lost all their power and are reduced to only regular vampire strength but there is still many, a whole army all loyal to Giles. Shortly after, Willow, Xander, Oz and Buffy enter a room to find Angel suspended in mid-air with a stake protruding from his heart, and yet he still lives. Giles has imprisoned Angel here for the past five years when Angel went out searching for Buffy. The orb Angel is trapped in freezes his body in the moment before his death; if the spell is broken, Angel will instantly die. Giles finds them all and Buffy stays to fight while the others rush off to help the other troops. Buffy initially is hesitant as Giles plays on her emotions, but with the help of Angel, she finally breaks through it, fighting Giles with the same sword she once sent Angel to Hell with. Eventually Giles gets the sword, but Buffy tricks him into hitting the orb trapping Angel, injuring Giles and causing Angel to finally die. Buffy grabs the stake Giles killed Angel with and stakes Giles, finally killing him, despite him taking on his human face again to play on her emotions. Meanwhile, Willow and Buffy's other friends try to help in the main fight, but there are too many vampires and most of the Council operatives are dead, leaving only three left. Wesley is killed by Giles' second in command Jax, who goes to kill Anna, the other Slayer, but Xander sacrifices himself to save her, killing Jax. The grief of his death causes Willow to tap into all her power and destroy the vampire army by smashing the windows and uncovering them, exposing the vampires to sunlight. Unfortunately both Wesley and Xander die as well as many of the Council operatives, but Giles and his army are dead and the world is saved. Finally Willow figures out a spell to send Buffy back in time. Guided by Lucy Hanover, Buffy goes back to the day where she told Willow that she didn't need her help with Camaztoz. But this time she asks for help. As Buffy fights to free Giles she is backed up by her friends. Thanks to a timely distraction from Willow, Buffy saves Giles where she couldn't before and he never becomes a vampire and thus never the Vampire King. Willow binds Zotzilaha into a snowglobe, but not before they force her to tell them where to find Camazotz. Buffy tries to have present-day Willow perform the alchemy spell before the final battle, but unlike her future self, she can't as she doesn't know the secret and is still unable to during the battle once she is asked to. Buffy and her friends defeat Camazotz's army, killing most of them before Buffy battles Camazotz, who is somewhat weakened from a previous attack from Willow. Desperate, he kills his remaining Kakchiquels, absorbing their power into himself and grows extremely powerful, easily beating Buffy. On the verge of defeat, Willow tries the alchemy spell again and manages to turn a stake to gold for Buffy. Catching Camazotz by surprise, Buffy stakes him through the heart with her golden stake, killing Camazotz and averting the future she visited completely. With Camazotz dead, Willow throws the golden stake overboard of the ship they were battling on and Buffy and her friends return home, with Buffy now possessing a new appreciation for her friends. =Continuity= *Follows continuity established in Lost Slayer Volume I, II, and III.

Also known as HD 44179, the nebula was discovered in 1973 during a rocket flight associated with the AFCRL Infrared Sky Survey called Hi Star. The binary system at the center of the nebula was first discovered by Robert Grant Aitken in 1915. Characteristics High-resolution images of it in visible and near infrared light reveal a highly symmetric, compact bipolar nebula with X-shaped spikes which imply anisotropic dispersion of the circumstellar material. The central binary system is completely obscured, providing no direct light. The Red Rectangle is known to be particularly rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The presence of such carbon-bearing macromolecules in the X-shaped nebular component, while the equatorial regions are known to contain silicate-rich (O-bearing) dust grains, was interpreted as due to a change of the O/C abundance ratio of the primary star during its late evolution. However, PAHs could also be formed as a result of the development of a central photondissociation region, a region in which a very active chemistry appears due to dissociation of stable molecules by the UV emission of the central stellar system. The Red Rectangle was the first nebula around an evolved star in which an equatorial disk in rotation was well identified (the existence of such disks has been demonstrated only in a few of these objects, only expansion is observed in most of them). However, the disk absorbs the stellar light and is practically not seen in the beautiful optical image, which mainly represents a relatively diffuse outflow that is very probably formed of material extracted from the denser disk. The distinct rungs suggest several episodes of increased ejection rate. The Red Rectangle is a proto-planetary nebula The Hubble Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new features in the Red Rectangle that cannot be seen by ground-based telescopes looking through Earth's turbulent atmosphere. The origins of many of the features in this dying star, in particular its X-shaped image, still remain hidden or even outright mysterious. The presence of a conspicuous bipolar symmetry is usual in protoplanetary and planetary nebulae. Theorists, like Noam Soker, , Adam Frank, and others, have shown that this axial symmetry can appear as a result of shocks due to interaction of different phases of the stellar winds (characteristic of the late stellar evolution), but its origin is still debated. On the other hand, the X-like shape and the low velocity of the outflowing gas in the Red Rectangle are peculiar, probably because its origin (associated to a stable, extended disk) is different than for most protoplanetary nebulae.

Jefferson Hall is one of six original \\"hotels\\" that Thomas Jefferson designed when laying out the plans for the University of Virginia. The hotels originally served as student dining facilities. When not boarding students, various student organizations made use of the building as meeting space. The Patrick Henry Society originally met in Hotel C until the group's dissolution in 1830. The Washington Literary Society and Debating Union met there from its founding in 1835 until 1837, at which point it moved to Pavilion VII on the Lawn and, from there, to hotels on the East Range (the current incarnation of the Washington Society now meets in Hotel C on Thursday evenings). In 1837, the University's Board of Visitors granted the Jefferson Society control of the largest room in the building and, in 1841, the BOV gave the group permission to remove the walls partitioning the main level of Hotel C, leaving that floor as one large room. The Confederate States of America used Jefferson Hall as a hospital during the American Civil War. Jefferson Hall underwent major restoration and renovation in summer 2006.

It is different from the Miniature Lop breed that is recognized by the British Rabbit Council (BRC). (In the UK, the Miniature Lop is sometimes called--for short--the \\"Mini Lop\\".) The Mini Lop [US] and the Miniature Lop [UK] are different from the Dwarf Lop breed that is recognized by the BRC (but not ARBA). The Mini Lop is similar to several other small rabbit breeds, such as the Dwarf rabbit. History Bob Herschbach discovered the Mini Lop breed at a German National Rabbit Show in Essen, Germany in 1972, where it was known as a Klein Widder. These first Mini Lops were originated from the German Big Lop and the small Chinchilla. These two breeds came originally in Agouti and white colors. German lops were about , slender and large with thick ears. Herschbach, a Mini Lop promoter, achieved the first procreation of Mini Lops in the United States, mainly through breeding an agouti lop pair and a white female lop in 1972. Their first baby lops were solid colors. A second generation came with broken colors. As a result of the breeding process, they began to obtain a high standard of qualities Mini Lop. In 1974, Herschbach's Mini Lop rabbits made their debut in an American Rabbit Breeders' Association (ARBA) convention held in Ventura, California. The outcome was that the breed needed to be downsized to a more compact, attractive size. In order to achieve this, Herschbach enlisted the assistance of other breeders by letting them breed more of his Mini Lops. One final touch resulted in changing the breed name from Klein Widders to \\"Mini Lop\\" to make it more appealing to the public. In 1977 the Mini Lop breed was under new sponsorship; Herb Dyke was the person in charge of this task. In 1978, Herschbach and Dyke created a correspondence club for the Mini Lops. Within a year, they had over 500 members who had contacted the ARBA with support for the Mini Lop rabbit. In 1980, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the National Rabbit Convention, this breed marked its success when it was recognized as an official rabbit breed sanctioned by ARBA. Shortly after, the Mini Lop Club of America was founded to promote it.http://www.minilop.org Personality A picture of a mini lop grooming his right leg. Like any animal, Mini Lops come in a variety of personalities but they are generally fairly friendly and extremely playful. Like all rabbits, they may be taught a variety of tricks and commands. They can be trained to respond to a clicker. A clicker can train them to come when it is clicked and give them a treat. If you give them a treat after every click for five minutes, go a meter away from it and click the clicker if it follows it has been clicker trained. There is a usual way for Mini Lops to show they are angry, that's stamping their hind foot. This may happens when your do not give food or snacks in time, or when they feel some strangers invade into their region and stamp hind foot to show their power or status. Despite their playful, energetic nature, Mini Lops thrive best in quiet, calm households with older children, as they can be quite skittish. Mini Lops need much time in the open air to run around and require plenty of stimulation. Showing Mini Lops The ideal Mini Lop is described as being a \\"basketball with a head\\". Judges like to see a nice rounded body with thick depth, long thick ears, a wide head and thick bone. ARBA Accepted Colors When showing Mini Lops the colors are broken down into two categories; Solids and Brokens. There are many colors available in this breed however only certain colors are accepted. Some of these colors are: Chinchilla, Chestnut Agouti, Lynx, Opal, Black, White, Ruby-Eyed White, Blue- Eyed White, Blue, Chocolate, Lilac, Orange, Tri Color Mini Lop Standard of Perfection Schedule of points according to the ARBA Standard of Perfection:http://www.arba.net General Type 80 *Body 43 *Head 20 *Ears and crown 12 *Feet, Legs & Bone 5 *Fur 10 *Color & Markings 5 *Condition 5 Weight Limits and showroom classes according to ARBA's Standard of Perfection: *Senior Bucks- 6 months of age and older, weight *Senior Does- 6 months of age and older, weight *Junior Bucks and Does- Under 6 months, weight The Mini Lop rabbit is classified as a medium-sized rabbit. Senior Bucks and Does must be six months of age and older and weigh no more than . Ideal weight is . Junior Bucks and Does must be under six months of age and weigh less than . The various colors within a variety are not judged separately. They are divided for judging into two groups, classifications, solid and broken pattern. General Type: When viewing the Mini Lop, one should see a rabbit that gives the general appearance of a massive, thick set, heavily muscled body. The animal should have a good balance of width and depth, allowing for a slight taper from the heavier hindquarters to the shoulders. There should be a good top line starting at the base of the skull and rising over the spine, with the peak over the center of the hips. The hips should be smooth, deep, well rounded and full in the lower hips. Faults: Long narrow body, chopped or undercut in the hips, and flat shoulders or hips. Head: The head of the Mini Lop Rabbit should have strong and bold features. The head is to be set closely on the shoulders, with the neck as short as possible. The crown of the head is very boldly arched. There is a slight curvature of the skull from the base of the crown down towards the nose. The head should appear to be wide and have a well filled muzzle. The size of the head should balance with the body. Buck heads are usually wider than doe heads. Faults: Long narrow head, pointed nose, concave or flat crown. Ears: The ears of the Mini Lop carry as many points as the head. The ears should rise from a strong base ridge and then loop vertically on both sides of the head, thus giving a horseshoe appearance. The ears should lie close to the cheeks, with the ear openings turned toward the head. The ear length should be about below the jaw and balance with the size of the animal. The ears should be well furred and rounded on the ends. Faults: Poor ear carriage, folds in ear, extremely thin or thick ears, and ears turning away from the head. Legs & Feet: Legs are important for good type. They should be straight, short, and thick. Toenail pigmentation can be either light or dark in the broken group. The front and rear nails may vary in color, but all front toenails must match and all rear toenails must match. Faults: Unmatched nails in broken colors. Disqualifications: General toenail disqualifications apply on all solid pattern groups. Fur: The Mini Lop fur is very thick and dense. It should be glossy and lustrous. It is medium in length with a good roll back. Faults: Long, thin, silky, harsh or extremely short fur. Color: Mini Lops come in many beautiful colors. When making a selection of stock, color really should be the last consideration before making your choice. Type should always be considered first. When judging, color points are divided equally between color and markings. The broken pattern includes any recognized color group in conjunction with white. A butterfly marking on the nose with wings outlined in white is preferred with colored eye circles and both ears colored. The body should have either a blanket or patched markings. Front feet should be white and rear feet may be white. Solid pattern includes any recognized color group. Faults: Lacking complete head markings, light body markings, and excessive white hairs in a solid pattern. Eyes: They may be any color, but must match each other. Disqualifications: Eyes that do not match. Foreign color spots in rabbits of the solid pattern group.

Early life Ruiz grew up in Lordsburg, New Mexico, the daughter of Manuel Ruiz and Delfina Aguilera who are from Mexico. Her father was a sometimes-unemployed alcoholic, and her mother's business supported the household. Her father verbally and emotionally abused her mother, who in turn vented her frustration on Ruiz, on whom she relied for support. When Ruiz was sixteen, her mother made a promesa to the Virgin of Guadalupe that if her eldest son Inocensio, Ruiz's older brother, survived his illness, she would scale Mount Cristo Rey in pilgrimage. Inocensio recovered and Aguilera took Ruiz along on this climb, where Ruiz felt a \\"mysterious force\\" lifting her up the mountain despite her fatigue. Though the family was Catholic before, following Inocensio's recovery the household devotion to the Church and to the Virgin of Guadalupe grew even stronger. While in her thirties, her mother developed and recovered from endometrial cancer, which she interpreted as her \\"cross to bear\\". The anthropologist Kristy Nabhan-Warren views Delfina Aguilera's \\"physical and marital suffering\\" as an enactment \\"in her own relationship with Jesus and the Virgin of Guadalupe.\\" The relationship between suffering and religion had a profound impact on Ruiz's understanding of life. A car accident twenty-five years later that led to her father's recovery from alcoholism allowed him to have a better relationship with her mother and to be a grandfather to Ruiz's children. Pre-apparition Ruiz married Reyes Ruiz, a man who had been a devotee of the Virgin of Guadalupe since the age of seven. The two had six children, four of whom graduated from institutes of higher education. One of their sons, Armando Ruiz, became a representative in the Arizona House of Representatives and later in the Arizona State Senate. After her children had all grown, Ruiz decided to return to school and focus on her career. She earned a Bachelor's degree in education from Ottawa University in Phoenix, and enrolled in a Master's of Education program at Northern Arizona University. In the early 1970s, she was hired to work for the Murphy School District in Phoenix and worked her way up the bureaucratic ladder to become superintendent of the district's bilingual programs. When her mother later began suffering as a result of the radiation therapy, Ruiz drove daily from her Phoenix workplace to the hospital in Lordsburg. She developed the same symptoms as her mother, whose death made Ruiz feel that she was going to die also. While she didn't die, she did realized how dependent she had been on her mother. She became determined to succeed in her career and started attending assertiveness-training courses offered at the hospital. The courses helped her to increase her self-esteem, set goals, separate herself from her mother, and feel like she was in control of her life. According to Ruiz, this sense of control was illusory: \\"I didn't realize that it was God who was in control, I actually thought I was the one in control, can you believe it?!\\" Meanwhile, her husband Reyes, who had long been involved in many Catholic activities, including the encuentro movement of Spanish-speaking Catholics in the United States, the Catholic farmworkers rights campaigns, and prison ministries, forged ties with Father Jack Spaulding of St. Maria Goretti Church in Scottsdale and his group of nine young Marian visionaries. In 1988, he accompanied Father Spaulding to Medjugorje, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Virgin Mary appeared to six youths beginning in 1981. While in Medjugorje, Reyes prayed that his wife would help lead the family down a more spiritual path. Despite her religious upbringing, Ruiz describes herself at the time as a skeptic and a \\"Sunday morning Catholic\\". A successful, sophisticated woman, Ruiz was embarrassed by Reyes' religiosity and was jealous of his affection for the dark-skinned Virgin. While her husband was gone, Ruiz almost took down the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe (painted by Reyes) that hung in their home. She decided to leave it up, however, and the next day as she walked past the painting, she heard it wish her a good morning. She dismissed the greeting as a figment of her imagination or a signal of mental instability. The next week, the painting greeted her again, and Ruiz felt a sensation that the voice was coming from the Virgin Mary. Following the two auditory experiences, Ruiz began waking up early with a strong desire to attend six o'clock mass. By the time Reyes returned, he found his wife much more open to his spirituality, and when he asked for her help to spiritually revitalize the family, she agreed. Shortly thereafter, Ruiz had two dreams of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Ruiz later interpreted these dreams as preparation for her first vision. First apparition On the night of December 3, 1988, Ruiz, Reyes, their son Fernando, and Fernando's wife Leticia, who was pregnant with their fourth child, were all praying the Rosary. Ruiz in particular was praying for her son Reyes Jr., who was struggling with cocaine addiction and for Fernando and Leticia's marriage. During the final decade, Ruiz says she saw a light emanating from a portrait of the Immaculate Heart of Mary that grew brighter until it forced her to close her eyes. At that moment, the Virgin spoke to her: \\"Don't you know that I am going to take care of your children?\\" Ruiz was overcome with emotion and began to cry, calling out, \\"Qu√© linda! Qu√© linda!\\" (\\"She's beautiful! She's beautiful!\\"). Post-apparition For the next ten years, Ruiz claimed that the Virgin appeared to at least weekly, and often daily. She identified herself as Our Lady of the Americas and relayed messages to the Ruiz family, the people of the barrio, and to greater community of \\"the Americas\\" via Ruiz, sometimes speaking in English and sometimes in Spanish. The majority of the messages focus on the necessity of prayer, especially of the rosary, and on the need to evangelize and \\"fight Satan\\" in order to make the world a better place. Some have interpreted the demand to improve the world as necessary prepare the world for the second coming of Jesus Christ. She also demanded a shrine, which the family built in their back yard during the next year. The shrine includes of a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a painting of Our Lady of the Americas by Reyes, and a life-sized wooden crucifix, also by Reyes. Ruiz wanted to drop out of school and immediately dedicate herself to the Virgin's work. Instead, she claims the Virgin counseled her to finish her program. She and her family spent the rest of the year \\"working on themselves\\", spiritually preparing themselves to go public with the messages. When they did, the Phoenix diocese investigated their claims and ultimately neither sanctioned nor disavowed them. Mary's Ministries, ECDC, and NFL-YET The Ruiz family began their evangelism through the creation of Mary's Ministries, a lay Catholic organization that runs leadership faith camps, and proselytizes. Mary's Ministries has branches in Linares Chile; Sullana, and Lima, Peru; Cuenca, Ecuador; Hirador, Southern Colombia, Franca, Brazil; Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico and in the Mexican states of Coahuila and Durango. A traditional representation of the Virgin Mary The desire for spiritual improvement led to a will to better the lives of people \\"in the world\\", which spawned several organizations. The ESPIRITU Community Development Corporation (ECDC), an outgrowth of Mary's Ministries, is a community development association designed to alleviate the suffering that results from the poverty of the barrio. The ECDC helps finance the development of low-income housing and lobbies for commercial development in the South Phoenix area, but its main function is to develop international, principle- based, servant leaders, which is in part accomplished by running the NFL Youth Education Town (NFL-YET), one of Arizona's first and largest charter schools, and its satellite campus in Safford. In Africa, Mary's Ministries has a missionary (Mary house) in Uganda, in East Africa, with 5 missionaries carrying forward Mary's Ministries' mission. The NFL-YET, formerly called Esperanza Montessori Academy, was enlarged to serve over 600 students after receiving a million-dollar grant from the NFL in 1996. Yearly celebration at the shrine The Ruizes' backyard shrine was an established pilgrimage site from 1989‚Äî1998. Ruiz appeared on the Geraldo Rivera Show and on the Sally Jessy Rapha√´l Show in the early 1990s and since then has traveled extensively to share her experiences. As a result, the shrine became one of the most frequented sites of the 1990s. The family also celebrates the anniversary of the first apparition, a celebration that has changed over time. While clergy have always been involved with the family and the phenomenon, the Church has become more involved over time as the shrine and Mary's Ministries have become more institutional. A procession was instituted in 1990, during which processioners carry holy images, statues, and crosses, sing hymns, and sprinkle holy water in the crime-ridden streets of South Phoenix. The hearing of confessions began in the early 1990s, and Mass and the Eucharist began in 1998. Attendance at the yearly celebration grew, peaking at about one thousand for the reading of the final message in 1998. Afterwards, the shrine was converted into an enclosed chapel, and the yard surrounding it was fenced in. Instead of being open to the community at all times, where it was one of the few neutral zones for South Phoenix's gangs, the chapel is now only open at certain hours. And since the final message, the yearly celebration has become more of a retreat for Mary's Ministries members, although the Matachina dancers who attended the first celebration and performed for the Virgin of Guadalupe still attend. Final apparition In August 1998 Ruiz related that the Virgin of the Americas would soon stop issuing her public messages. Ruiz claimed to have received the final public message in December of the same year, but continues to receive personal and family messages. At the final, emotional reading, Ruiz read a message that focused on the Virgin's power of healing.

Built in late 1830 and opened in 1831, it is the oldest building still standing in Western Australia. It is located at Arthur Head in Fremantle, and recent heritage assessments and appraisals of the precinct of the Round House incorporate Arthur Head. Design and construction A photograph of The Round House in the late 19th century It was designed by Henry Willey Reveley; construction commenced in 1830 and was completed on 18 January 1831. Intended as a prison, it had eight cells and a jailer's residence, all of which opened onto a central courtyard. The design was based on the Panopticon, a kind of prison designed by philosopher Jeremy Bentham.The Round House Gaol: Western Australia's first lunatic asylum. The Round House was built by Richard Lewis in partnership with W Manning and J H Duffield for ¬£1840/0/0. Worked commenced in August 1830 and was complete in January 1831 for the cost of ¬£1603/10/0 this lower cost was due to the builders' being able to source the limestone locally. In 1833 a well was dug in the central compound. Reveley calculated that the depth of the well needed to be . The Fremantle Whaling Company in 1837 requested that a tunnel be dug through Arthur Head to High street. As part of the agreement they constructed a breakwater to protect shipping up to 150 tons. The company paid for both the construction of the tunnel and the breakwater with Reverley overseeing both. The tunnel was 57 metres long and linked the Bathers Beach Whaling Station to the High Street. The tunnel was constructed in five months and completed in January 1838. This rapid progress was possible because prisoners from the Round House were used and the rock, although load bearing and sound, was capable of being mined with a pick axe. Today the tunnel is only 45 metres long, as the cliffs were cut back some time after 1880. Usage The Round House was used for colonial and indigenous prisoners until 1886, when control of the Convict Establishment prison (now Fremantle Prison) was transferred to the colony. After that the Round House was used as a police lockup until 1900, when it became the living quarters for the chief constable and his family.Conole, Peter. and Graeme Sisson (2005) Policing in the Round House. including details of Constable Thomas Powers who lived in the building in 1898.

Preservation The Round House had a plaque placed by the Royal Western Australian Historical Society as part of the commemoration of historical sites in the Western Australia centenary year of 1929. However, in the 1940s and 1950s it was used as storage site, raising concerns about its condition as a result.

In 1804 a straight-line \\"BAHAMAS\\" handstamp came into use. The Royal Mail Line initiated a regular mail service in 1841, and from 1846 used a \\"Crown Paid\\" handstamp along with a dated postmark for New Providence.  First stamps  The use of postage stamps began in April 1858 with a consignment of British stamps. These were cancelled \\"A05\\" at Nassau. The use of British stamps was brief however; in the following year the Bahamian post office became independent of London, and issued its own stamps beginning 10 June 1859. These stamps featured the \\"Chalon\\" portrait of Queen Victoria, along with symbols of the islands (pineapple and conch shell) and the inscription \\"INTERINSULAR POSTAGE\\", because at first the stamps were used only locally, with London continuing in charge of external mail until May 1860. Letterbox in the Bahamas. Printed by Perkins Bacon, initially unwatermarked and imperforate, perforation was introduced in 1860, and the \\"Crown & CC\\" watermark in 1863. The transition to local control left Bahamians with only their 1d stamp to pay all rates of postage, and covers to foreign destinations show blocks of the stamp used to cover the 4d rate to North America and the 6d rate to Great Britain. The government remedied this in 1861 by contracting for 4d and 6d stamps, still using the Chalon head, but with a simpler design. De la Rue later took over printing duties in 1862, their product being differentiated by an 11.5-12 perforation, as opposed to the previous 14-16. A one-shilling value appeared in 1865. In 1884, a new design employed the ubiquitous Victoria profile of the time, with the symbols retained, and \\"BAHAMAS\\" inscribed with colored letters in an arch over the vignette. Values issued ranged up to one pound. In 1901, the Bahamas became one of the Empire's early issuers of a pictorial stamp, with a depiction of the Queen's Staircase in Nassau. The same design was reused for 5-pence, 2-shilling, and 3-shilling values in 1903. In 1915, the Bahamas concluded an unusual agreement with Canada, in which the two countries arranged special delivery services by exchanging stamps, this being done for the benefit of tourists visiting from Canada. The Bahamians accomplished by overprinting 5d Staircase issues with \\"SPECIAL / DELIVERY\\" and sending them to Canada, where they were on sale in four post offices (Ottawa, Toronto, Westmount, and Winnipeg) for 10 cents each. The arrangement was short-lived, with only about 430 overprinted stamps being sold in Canada while it was in effect. This cover was carried on the first flight from Nassau to Miami, Florida, 2 January 1929.  Twentieth century  The years from 1902 into the 1930s involved the usual profiles of Edward VII and George V. In 1920 a set of five stamps celebrated peace after World War I, and in 1930 another set of five depicting the Bahamian seal marked the 300th anniversary of the colony's founding. In 1935, a pictorial stamp depicted flamingoes in flight; this design was re-used in 1939 replaced with George VI's profile, along with designs showing Fort Charlotte, and a \\"sea garden\\", likely the first time underwater scenery appeared on a stamp. But the mainstay of the George VI period was a set of small definitives only slightly updated from previous designs. 4d stamp showing the \\"sea garden\\" 1938. In October 1942, the definitives were overprinted to mark the 450th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' landing. In 1948, the 300th anniversary of the settlement of Eleuthera was commemorated with a set of 16 pictorials (somewhat belated in a way, since most of the Empire's colonies had extensive pictorial sets issued for them in 1938). The designs were re-used in the issue of 1954, replacing the portrait with one of Elizabeth II, and removing the commemorative inscription. The Bahamas issued commemoratives for the centenary of Bahamian stamps in 1959, and for the centenary of Nassau in 1962. Also in 1962, two stamps were overprinted to mark the talks that led to the Nassau agreement. In 1964 the entire set of the 1954 issue was overprinted \\"NEW CONSTITUTION / 1964\\" in recognition of self-government. A new set of 15 definitives in 1965 featured an updated layout, but repeating many of the same themes as seen in the 1954 stamps. These were overprinted with new currencies in the decimalisation of 1966, and then redesigned in 1967 with the new values. From the 1970s on, the Bahamas issued an assortment of large and colorful stamps aimed at collectors, though not in great numbers.

Dem√©tre Chiparus died in 1947, suffering a stroke on returning from studying animals at the zoo in Vincennes. He was buried in Bagneux Cemetery, just south of Paris. Work =Early career= The first sculptures of Chiparus were created in the realistic style and were exhibited at the Salon of 1914. He employed the combination of bronze and ivory, called chryselephantine, to great effect. Most of his renowned works were made between 1914 and 1933. The first series of sculptures manufactured by Chiparus were the series of the children. =Later career= The mature style of Chiparus took shape beginning in the 1920s. His sculptures are remarkable for their bright and outstanding decorative effect. Dancers of the Russian Ballet, French theatre, and early motion pictures were among his more notable subjects and were typified by a long, slender, stylized appearance. His work was influenced by an interest in Egypt, after Pharaoh Tutankhamen's tomb was excavated. Chiparus created one of the most iconic bronzes in 1928 called \\"Danseuse au cerceau\\" or \\"Ring Dancer\\" inspired in the famous and prodigious dancer Zoula de Boncza of the Parisian \\"Folies Bergere\\", a first dancer of The Belgrado Royal Opera and a Mime dancer of \\"l'Op√©ra-Comique\\" in Paris. Later in life Zoula de Boncza, a descendant of Polish nobility and one of Loie Fuller best students, created a book published in 1961: the dance method \\"La Danse classique sans barre\\". The book was published with texts from Eug√®ne de Rijac and Illustrations by Alexandre Berlant and Yvonne Breton. He worked primarily with the Edmond Etling and Cie Foundry in Paris administrated by Julien Dreyfus. Les Neveux de J. Lehmann was the second foundry who constantly worked with Chiparus and produced the sculptures cast from his models. He based many of his works on the ballet and the theatre, one particular theme being the Ballets Russes from which resulted \\"The Russian Dancers\\" depicting Vaslav Nijinsky and Ida Rubenstein in that role in Sch√©h√©razade. =The Salon= Chiparus rarely exhibited at the Salon. In 1923 he showed his ‚ÄúJavelin Thrower‚Äù and in 1928 exhibited his ‚ÄúTa-Keo‚Äù dancer, which was edited by the manufacture Friedrich Goldscheider. During the period of Nazi persecution and the World War II the foundries discontinued production of work by Chiparus. The economic situation of that time was not favorable to the development of decorative arts and circumstances for many sculptors worsened. For a time in the early 1940s almost no works of Chiparus were sold but he continued sculpting for his own pleasure, depicting animals in the Art Deco style. At the 1942 Paris Salon, the plaster sculptures ‚ÄúPolar Bear‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmerican Bison‚Äù were exhibited and in 1943 he showed a marble ‚ÄúPolar Bear‚Äù and plaster ‚ÄúPelican‚Äù. Style Sculptures of Chiparus represent the classical manifestation of Art Deco style in decorative bronze ivory sculpture. Traditionally, four factors of influence over the creative activity of the artist can be distinguished: Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, ancient Egyptian art, and French theatre. Early motion pictures were among his more notable subjects and were typified by figures with a long, slender, stylized appearance. Some of his sculptures were directly inspired by Russian dancers. For example, faces of ‚ÄúPersian Dance‚Äù figures reveal the likenesses of Vaslav Nijinsky and Ida Rubinstein, and the dress in ‚ÄúStarfish Girl‚Äù exactly reproduces the sketch for Goldfish‚Äôs dress from the ballet ‚ÄúUnderwater kingdom‚Äù by Lev Annensky. Chiparus could have been influenced by Russian ballets indirectly, through the performances of French music halls and cabarets which bore traces of the strong impact of Russian ballet. Quite often, Chiparus used the photos of Russian and French dancers, stars and models from fashion magazines of his time. After the tomb of Tutankhamun was discovered in 1922, the art of ancient Egypt and the East came to French fashion and is also reflected in the creative activity of Chiparus. Several sculptures by Chiparus and Claire Colinet represent queen Cleopatra and Egyptian dancers. The sculptures of Chiparus reflect his time and 1920-1930s sentiment of ‚Äúfolle‚Äù. Coming from the oldest French tradition of high-quality and extra-artistic decorative arts, the sculptures of Chiparus combine elegance and luxury, embodying the spirit of the Art Deco epoch. Collector interest in the work of Chiparus appeared in the 1970s and has flourished since the 1990s. A major collection of Chiparus' work is on display in the permanent collection of Casa Lis, the art nouveau and art deco museum in Salamanca, Espana. Death and legacy Dem√©tre Chiparus died in Paris in 1947, suffering a stroke on returning from studying animals at the zoo in Vincennes. He was buried in Bagneux Cemetery, just south of Paris. Chiparus is remembered as one of the most important artists of the Art Deco era.

Biography Tsuboi K≈çz≈ç was born as Hara K≈çz≈ç, the second son of a doctor in what is now part of H≈çfu, Yamaguchi, and was adopted into the Tsuboi family as a child. As a Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain samurai he took part in the defense of the city during the bombardment of Shimonoseki by European warships from September 5 to 8, 1864. Witnessing firsthand the firepower and devastation caused by a relatively few Western warships, Tsuboi became convinced Japan must also obtain this weaponry to survive. He enlisted in the Ch≈çsh≈´ domain navy later that year and served aboard the Kigai-maru while studying the English language and navigation at the Ch≈çsh≈´ Naval School. Serving on five Ch≈çsh≈´ domain ships between 1866 and 1868, Tsuboi assisted in transporting imperial soldiers on the Inland Sea during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration against the Tokugawa shogunate, and was later officially commissioned a lieutenant in the newly established Imperial Japanese Navy in 1870, and assigned to the screw sloop . He became executive officer of the ironclad warship in 1871. That same year he received training on board the flagship of the American Asiatic Squadron and was sponsored by Admiral John Rodgers to attend Columbia University from April 1872 until July 1874. Returning to Japan in 1874, Tsuboi was promoted to lieutenant commander. His first command was as captain of the Dai Ichi Teib≈ç from August 3, 1874. From 1875 through 1879, he surprised warship construction at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal; however, he was injured in an accident in August 1878 which required two months hospitalization. On his return to active status in February 1879, he served as commander of various ships, including the paddle corvette , gunboat , corvette and corvette , and various shore posts until 1889 (including Deputy Director of the Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Department. He returned to sea as captain the cruiser from April 1889 to September 1890, serving simultaneously as chief-of-staff of the Readiness Fleet. Promoted to rear admiral from September 1890, Tsuboi was commander of the Sasebo Naval District to December 1892, commandant of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy from 1892 to 1893, and commandant of the Naval Staff College from 1893 to 1894. In command of the Readiness Fleet during the First Sino-Japanese War, Tsuboi was at the Battle of Pungdo in command of the , and later won distinction at the Battle of the Yalu on September 17, 1894, where (as commander of the Flying Squadron), he displayed innovative tactics and aggressive maneuvers against the Chinese Beiyang Fleet. A national hero following the war, Tsuboi was ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system on August 20, 1895, and promoted to vice admiral the following year. In 1896 he was made Commander in Chief of the Readiness Fleet, and in 1897, Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District. He died of cancer in 1898.

Design and development The fourth production P-36A (serial 38-004) became a development platform for a direct successor, designated XP-42 by the USAAC. The most striking difference from the P-36 was a longer, streamlined nose cowling (concealing a longer propeller shaft). These features attempted to improve the aerodynamics of the air-cooled radial engine. Because of this feature, the XP-42 superficially resembled aircraft equipped with in-line liquid-cooled engines (such as the P-40, another development of the P-36). When the XP-42 first flew in March 1939, it proved to be faster than the P-36. However, the P-40 was faster still and the new nose cowling caused engine cooling problems that proved to be unresolvable, despite at least 12 sets of modifications. The XP-42 project was canceled. However, the XP-42 prototype was retained as a test-bed and was later fitted with an all-moving tail (stabilator), for research purposes. The XP-42 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-1830-31 engine fitted with extensions to the propeller shaft and nose casing to give it a streamlined nose.

Its name was derived by spelling NetBus backwards (\\"suBteN\\") and swapping \\"ten\\" with \\"seven\\". Sub7 has not been maintained since 2004. Because its typical use is to allow undetected and unauthorized access, Sub7 is usually described as a trojan horse by security experts. Starting with version 2.1 (1999) it could be controlled via IRC. As one security book phrased it: \\"This set the stage for all malicious botnets to come.\\" Additionally Sub7 has some features deemed of little use in legitimate remote administration like keystroke logging. Sub7 worked on the Windows 9x and on the Windows NT family of operating systems, up to and including Windows 8.1.  History  Sub7 was originally written by a programmer with the handle \\"mobman\\". No development had occurred in several years until a new version was scheduled for release on Feb. 28th, 2010. In 2006 (sub7legends.net) re-opened with hundreds of thousands of users, and has kept Sub7 alive with clean downloads and support and new software releases. SubSeven 2.3, released on March 9, 2010, was revamped to work on all 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows and includes TCP Tunnel and Password Recovery for browsers, instant messengers and email clients. It was very buggy and was not written in Delphi which the original author used. The website that claimed to do this is no longer active.  Architecture and features  Like other remote admin programs, Sub7 is distributed with a server and a client. The server is the program that the host must run in order to have their machines controlled remotely, and the client is the program with a GUI that the user runs on their own machine to control the server/host PC. Computer security expert Steve Gibson once said that with these features, Sub7 allows a hacker to take \\"virtually complete control\\" over a computer. Sub7 is so invasive, he said, that anyone with it on their computer \\"might as well have the hacker standing right next to them\\" while using their computer.Gibson, Steve. The strange tale of the denial of service attacks on grc.com. 2002-03-05. Sub7 has more features than Netbus (webcam capture, multiple port redirect, user- friendly registry editor, chat and more), but it always tries to install itself into windows directory and it does not have activity logging. According to a security analysis,Crapanzano, Jamie (2003), \\"Deconstructing SubSeven, the Trojan Horse of Choice., SANS Institute Information Security Reading Sub7's server-side (target computer) features include: * recording: ** sound files from a microphone attached to the machine ** images from an attached video camera ** screen shots of the computer * retrieving a listing of recorded and cached passwords * taking over an ICQ account used on the target machine (back then the most popular messaging service); added in version 2.1. This included the ability to disable the local use of the account and read the chat history * features which were presumably intended to be used for prank or irritating purposes including: ** changing desktop colors ** opening and closing the optical drive ** swapping the mouse buttons ** turning the monitor off/on ** \\"text2speech\\" voice synthesizer which allowed the remote controller to have the computer \\"talk\\" to its user * penetration testing features, including a port scanner and a port redirector On the client-side the software had an \\"address book\\" that allowed the controller to know when the target computers are online. Additionally the server program could be customized before being delivered by a so-called server editor (an idea borrowed from Back Orifice 2000). Customizations possible with the Sub7 server editor included changing the port addresses, displaying a customized message upon installation that could be used for example \\"to deceive the victim and mask the true intent of the program\\". The Sub7 server could also be configured to notify the controller of IP address changes of the host machine by email, ICQ or IRC. Connections to Sub7 servers can be password protected with a chosen password. A deeper reverse engineering analysis revealed however that \\"SubSeven's author has secretly included a hardcoded master password for all of his Trojans! The Trojan itself has been Trojaned\\". For Version 1.9 the master password is predatox and 14438136782715101980 for versions 2.1 through 2.2b. The Master Password for SubSeven DEFCON8 2.1 Backdoor is acidphreak. SANS, A Risk to Your Internet Security Chapter Name: \\"The Inner Workings of Sub7\\" on page 14 notes several master passwords used.  Uses and incidents  SubSeven has been used to gain unauthorized access to computers. While it can be used for making mischief (such as making sound files play out of nowhere, change screen colors, etc.), it can also read keystrokes that occurred since the last boot‚Äîa capability that can be used to steal passwords and credit card numbers.Sub7 analysis from Sophos In 2003, a hacker began distributing a Spanish-language email purporting to be from security firm Symantec that was used to trick recipients into downloading Sub7.

She attended Eagle Rock High School in northeast Los Angeles, California, graduating in 1941. She then attended Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1941 to 1944. She is named for the tui, a bird native to New Zealand, where her mother was born. Career She moved to New York City in 1946, working as a composer, conductor, and recorder player, and spending most of her professional life in New York City. Her compositions often feature microtonality and are strongly influenced by early music. She developed special recorders with extra holes, as well as special fingerings for the recorder to allow for the playing of quarter tones. Her Indian Summer: Three Microtonal Antiphons on Psalm Texts for two baritones and chamber ensemble combines the use of quarter tones with a Latin text. From 1947 to 1970 she spent her summers as the music director of Camp Catawba for Boys, located near the Blue Ridge Parkway on the Boone side of Blowing Rock, North Carolina. Pianist Grete Sultan also worked there during several summers. Personal life In 1985, Tui inherited the camp grounds from her lifelong partner, poet and scholar Vera Lachmann (1904‚Äì1985), who had founded the camp in 1944, and lived there year-round from then until her death on April 21, 2004.

Proto- Romanian Romanian has inherited a number of about 10.000 (on a study based on 49,649 words) lexical items from its ancestral language, Latin. These comprise most basic concepts of society, for example: * om \\"human\\" (< Latin homo) * muiere \\"wife\\" (< Latin mulier) * fiu \\"son\\" (< Latin filius) * popor \\"folk\\" (< Latin populus) Many words have not only changed their shape, but also their meaning during their evolution from Latin to Romanian. Such are: * bƒÉrbat \\"man\\" (< Latin barbatus \\"bearded\\") * femeie \\"woman\\" (< Latin familia \\"people belonging to a household\\") * inimƒÉ \\"heart\\" (< Latin anima \\"soul\\") * so»õ \\"husband\\" (< Latin socius \\"fellow\\") Medieval Romanian By the later Middle Ages, a great number of Slavic loanwords had already entered Romanian. Among the basic Slavic loanwords are: * ceas clock * citi to read * crai king * curvƒÉ whore * da yes * drag dear * dragoste love * duh spirit, ghost * hainƒÉ shirt * iubi to love * izvor source * m√¢ndru proud * muncƒÉ work * noroc luck * opri stop * porni start * praf dust * prieten friend * prost stupid; simple * r√¢nd row; order * sƒÉrac poor * sf√¢nt holy * sfert quarter * slaninƒÉ bacon * sm√¢nt√¢nƒÉ sour cream * sutƒÉ hundred * t√¢rg market * tigaie pan * trup body * veac century * vreme weather; time * zid wall (see also Slavic influence on Romanian) Modern Romanian In the 19th century, as the Romanian society transitioned from rural and agricultural towards urban and industrial, the lexis underwent a vigorous enrichment with loanwords from its Romance relatives, French and Italian. Many scholarly and technical terms were also imported from Neo-Latin. Some words, especially of Greek (', ', ') and Turkish (', ', ') origin, fell into relative disuse or acquired an ironic connotation. The Slavic part of the lexis, of earlier entry and more deeply anchored into the language, survived relatively unscathed. Among the words which entered the language: * deja \\"already\\" (from French d√©j√†) * jena \\"disturb\\" (from French gener) * medic \\"physician\\" (from Latin medicus) * servi \\"serve\\" (from French or Italian) * ziar \\"newspapers\\" (from Italian diario) Romanian's core lexicon (2,581 words); Marius Sala, VRLR (1988) A statistical analysis sorting Romanian words by etymological source carried out by Macrea (1961) based on the DLRM (49,649 words) showed the following makeup: * 43% recent Romance loans (mainly French: 38.42%, Latin: 2.39%, Italian: 1.72%) * 20% inherited Latin * 11.5% Slavic (Old Church Slavonic: 7.98%, Bulgarian: 1.78%, Bulgarian- Serbian: 1.51%) * 8.31% Unknown/unclear origin * 3.62% Turkish * 2.40% Modern Greek * 2.17% Hungarian * 1.77% German (including Austrian High German)Hans Dama, \\"Lexikale Einfl√ºsse im Rum√§nischen aus dem √∂sterreichischen Deutsch\\" (\\"Lexical influences of 'Austrian'-German on the Romanian Language\\") * 2.24% Onomatopoeic If the analysis is restricted to a core vocabulary of 2,500 frequent, semantically rich and productive words, then the Latin inheritance comes first, followed by Romance and classical Latin neologisms, whereas the Slavic borrowings come third. Romanian has a lexical similarity of 77% with Italian, 75% with French, 74% with Sardinian, 73% with Catalan, 72% with Portuguese and Rheto-Romance, 71% with Spanish. Turkish Large parts of modern-day Romania were under Ottoman suzerainty for several centuries. As a result, exchanges in language, food and culture occurred, and Romanian has absorbed several words of Turkish origin. A small ethnic Turkish minority exists in Dobruja. * abanos \\"ebony\\" (< Turkish abanoz) * arpagic \\"chive\\" (< Turkish arpacƒ±k) * baclava \\"baclava\\" (< Turkish baklava) * bac»ôi·π£ \\"tip, gratuity\\" (< Turkish bah»ôi»ô) * basma \\"handkerchief\\" (< Turkish basma) * batal \\"wether\\" (< Turkish batal) * belea \\"misfortune\\" (< Turkish bela) * boi \\"appearance\\" (< Turkish boy) * bre \\"hey\\" (< Turkish bre) * briceag \\"pocket knife\\" (< Turkish bƒ±√ßak) * buluc \\"pile\\" (< Turkish b√∂luk) * burghiu \\"drill\\" (< Turkish b√ºrgu) * bursuc \\"badger\\" (< Turkish porsuk) * caimac \\"cream\\" (< Turkish kaymak) * caisƒÉ \\"apricot\\" (< Turkish kayƒ±sƒ±) * calcanƒÉ \\"turbot\\" (< Turkish kalkan balƒ±ƒüƒ±) * caldar√¢m \\"pavement\\" (< Turkish kaldƒ±rƒ±m) * capcanƒÉ \\"trap\\" (< Turkish kapkan) * caraghios \\"funny\\" (< Turkish Karag√∂z) * cat \\"storey\\" (< Turkish kat) Lots of the Ottoman and Phanariot Greek words have acquired pejorative meanings compared with their original meaning: * Turkish (\\"stick\\") became (\\"the tube of a hookah\\") and now is \\"bribe\\", since, like a pipe, it is offered to ease a deal. * Ottoman (\\"treasure, treasure chamber\\") became (\\"septic tank, latrine\\"). * Phanariot Greek (\\"practical-minded man\\") became (\\"immoral person\\").

After two years, very little progress had been made and the railroad was purchased by the Pidcock Family who had founded a private logging railroad in the early 1890s that ran north from Pidcock, Georgia. The Pidcocks combined their assets into the Georgia Northern Railway. The railroad was operating between Albany and Boston by 1905. They then began purchasing other railroads. It bought the Flint River and Northeastern Railroad in 1910, the Georgia, Ashburn, Sylvester and Camilla Railway in 1922, and the Georgia Southwestern and Gulf Railroad in 1939. The coterie of roads became known as the Pidcock Kingdom shortlines in Sowega. The Southern Railway took over the Georgia Northern in 1966, fully merging it with the Albany and Northern Railway and the GAS&C; (apparently included in the GN purchase) in 1972, but maintaining the GN name for the subsidiary.

Excessive avoidance has been suggested to contribute to anxiety disorders, leading psychologists and neuroscientists study how avoidance behaviors are learned using rat or mouse models. Avoidance learning is a type of operant conditioning (also known as instrumental conditioning).  Active avoidance, passive avoidance, and escape responses  An escape response occurs when an aversive stimulus is presented and the subject makes a response to remove or escape the stimulus. In the laboratory, this is usually represented by a rat given a small shock to its feet through a grid floor and shuttling through a small opening in its chamber which stops the shock. Such a response is considered active avoidance when it occurs prior to the stimulus presentation and prevents the stimulus from occurring. In contrast, passive avoidance is the prevention of an aversive stimulus by withholding a behavior, which is usually demonstrated by placing a rat in a chamber with a raised platform in which refraining from stepping off the platform prevents a foot shock. To demonstrate an avoidance response requires repeated reinforcement through instrumental conditioning.  Avoidance learning in the laboratory  = Signaled active avoidance = Signaled avoidance involves classical conditioning such that the aversive stimulus becomes an unconditioned stimulus (US) paired with a conditioned stimulus (CS), usually a tone or flash of light. First rats are conditioned to associate the CS with an inescapable US until presentation of the CS elicits a fear response. After that, rats are placed into avoidance chambers and presented with the CS for a short amount of time, during which they may shuttle through the opening, preventing the US from occurring, therefore presenting an avoidance response. = Unsignaled avoidance = This format does not use Pavlovian learning to condition avoidance responses. In the same shuttle chamber, aversive stimuli are presented in regular time intervals (usually 5 seconds) without any neutral stimuli preceding them. These intervals are called shock-shock (S-S) intervals, but when an avoidance response is made by the rat, the next shock is delayed by a 30 second response-shock (R-S) interval. = Pavlovian instrumental transfer = This form of conditioning combines Pavlovian learning with unsignaled avoidance conditioning in order to test whether rats are able to transfer their learned behavioral response to a previously inescapable conditioned stimulus. First rats undergo traditional Pavlovain fear learning in which they are not able to escape or avoid the US shock following the CS tone. After the training session the rats complete unsignaled avoidance learning (see above) for multiple days. As a test of Pavlovian instrumental transfer, rats are placed into the same shuttle chambers as for unsignaled avoidance training and presented with the tone CS they received during the Pavlovian conditioning. In this case they have the opportunity to avoid the incoming shock as long as they are able to connect that the CS precedes a shock in different contexts.  Neural circuits  The neural circuit responsible for expressing signaled avoidance behavior is the same that controls extinction of fear responses. The presentation of the aversive stimulus activates neurons in the central amygdala which project to the periaqueductal gray region to elicit a fear-motivated motor response. Cells in the infralimbic (IL) region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) send inhibitory signals to the central amgydala to prevent the motor response. In rats, the fear-motivated response is to freeze, so in both fear extinction and avoidance conditioning inhibition of the amygdala via the mPFC leads to more movement (shuttling) and less freezing. The basolateral region of the amygdala is implicated in extinction of fear behaviors and expression of avoidance behaviors; however, the central amygdala is necessary for Pavlovian instrumental transfer  References  Category:Behavioral concepts ","title":"Avoidance learning"},{"id":"3604223","text":"Mengzi () is a city in the southeast of Yunnan Province, China. Administratively, it is a county-level city and the seat of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, located about south-southeast of the provincial capital of Kunming. It is situated in the centre of a fertile valley basin on a plateau above sea level and was home to 417,156 inhabitants as of 2010 census. Mengzi was formerly Mengzi County () until October 2010, when it was upgraded to a county-level city. Name As with many other places in China, a variety of Romanized spellings were used for the name of Mengzi city in the past. The traditional French spelling was Mongtseu; the postal, Mengtsz, Mengtzu or Mongtze. Some works in English used the spelling M√™ng-tse., originally published 1910. Pages 86 sq. or Mengtsze. Government The municipal seat is in Wenlan Town. Geography and climate Mengzi (labelled as MENG-TZU (MENGTSZ) ) (1954) Located within 30 arc minutes south of the Tropic of Cancer, Mengzi, as with much of southern Yunnan, has a warm humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Cwa), with muddled distinction between the seasons and daytime temperatures remaining warm year-round. Highs peak in May before the core of the rainy season and reach a minimum in December; however, the warmest and coolest months are June and December, respectively at and ; the annual mean is . June thru September accounts for over 60% of the annual rainfall of and during this time, some rainfall occurs on a majority of days, resulting in a marked reduction in sunshine. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 34% in June and July to 64% in February, the city receives 2,161 hours of bright sunshine annually. Food The Mengzi region is well known for a dish called guoqiao mixian (\\"Over the Bridge Rice Noodle\\"), made with long rice-flour noodles. History In 2012 it became apparent that several sets of fossil hominins from Maludong near Mengzi City (some of them already in museum collections) might potentially belong to a new species of homo sapiens although only 11-14K years old. These are provisionally known as the Red Deer Cave people. In the 19th century, Mengzi was a trading centre for commerce between the interior of Yunnan and the Hanoi-Haiphong area of Vietnam. In 1886, a French convention chose Mengzi to be the center of trade in Yunnan province for importing and exporting goods via Tongking in Vietnam. Facilities for this opened two years later. Communications were inconvenient: goods from Hanoi or Haiphong were shipped to Hekou on the Vietnamese border by junk, transferred by small craft to Manhao, and then taken by pack animal to Mengzi. Despite these difficulties, Mengzi was an important port of entry into both Yunnan and western Guizhou provinces, and in 1889 it was opened to foreign trade as a treaty port. Most of this foreign trade was in tin and opium. Its main exports were tin and opium, and the main imports were mostly textiles (primarily cotton) and tobacco. As a trading center, the city gradually began to lose its importance beginning from the early 20th century. The importance of Mengzi was ended by the construction of the French railway from Haiphong to Kunming (the Yunnan provincial capital) in 1906‚Äì10. This railway bypassed Mengzi, but in 1915 a branch line was built via the town to the Gejiu tin mines. Apart from a brief respite during the early days of World War II, the town of Mengzi has, nevertheless, steadily declined in importance ever since. Gejiu became a county in 1913, and a city in 1951. With the improvement of communications and transportation between cities of Gejiu and Kaiyuan and the other counties nearby, plus the development of trade between southwestern China and the countries of Southeast Asia, Mengzi's ties have increasingly strengthened with Gejiu and Kaiyuan. The whole area has become a border economic centre. In addition to tin, the county's natural resources include coal, manganese, lead, zinc, and antimony. When Japanese troops drove Beijing and Tianjin university professors, students, and administrators out of those cities, and then later out of Changsha as well, the academics made their own long march to Yunnan Province. They first established themselves in Mengzi, but after a year or so moved on to the provincial capital, Kunming. This was Lianda, or the Southwest Associated Universities. Recently, the prefectural government has moved from nearby Gejiu to Mengzi. New wealthy suburbs and large government offices have sprung up as a result, but much of the poverty remains, creating a large wealth gap within the city. =Twin towns ‚Äî Sister cities= Mengzi is twinned with: * Modesto, California, United States  Economy  Like nearby Gejiu, mining, mostly of tin, is a large part of its economy.  Transport  * The narrow-gauge Kunming‚ÄìHai Phong Railway, in the mountains east of the city (passenger service discontinued), and its branches * The Yuxi‚ÄìMengzi Railway (opened in 2013) and the Mengzi‚ÄìHekou Railway (opened in December 2014); regular passenger service between Kunming and Hekou. * Honghe Mengzi Airport is scheduled to be built in Mengzi. *Honghe tram runs from Mengzi North railway station to the centre.

Career Coming from Adelaide, South Australia, Ryan attended the Catholic Mount Carmel College, before moving to the Australian Institute of Sport, Canberra, in 1993 after being awarded a scholarship. She gained selection for Australia the following year at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia. In 1996, in Atlanta, she came sixth in the 100-metre freestyle, and was a member of the 4√ó100-metre medley relay along with Susie O'Neill, Samantha Riley and Nicole Stevenson, which claimed silver behind the United States team. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, she was a part of the team which won the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay only days after the death of her father. In 2000, in Sydney, Ryan failed to qualify for the finals of either the 50- or 100-metre freestyle. She was a member of the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay which placed sixth and collected a silver for swimming in the heats of the 4√ó100-metre medley relay, being replaced by O'Neill in the final, again second to the Americans. In 2001, possibly her most savoured moment came at the FINA World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, when she anchored the 4√ó100-metre medley relay team with Dyana Calub, Leisel Jones and Petria Thomas to a long-awaited win over the American team. It was the first time that Australia had defeated the Americans at either Olympic or World level in the event. The year 2002 broke another drought, with Ryan being part of a 4√ó100-metre freestyle team alongside Jodie Henry, Alice Mills and Thomas, which defeated the Americans for the first time since 1956. In 2003, Ryan took time away from swimming and commenced a job as a breakfast radio presenter, as well as an occasional swimming analyst on SBS' Toyota World Sports and Channel Nine's Wide World of Sports. However, with Australia's young sprinting talent on the rise, she made a comeback to qualify for the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay team for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Ryan swam in the heats, but was replaced in the final by Thomas, who combined with Henry, Mills and Libby Lenton to claim gold in a world record time of 3min 35.94 seconds. Ryan retired after the games. In 2006, to support multiple sclerosis research, Ryan teamed up with 2003 Australian Idol winner and award-winning recording artist Guy Sebastian in 7 Network's It Takes Two, in which famous accomplished Australians from their different fields, and not known to be singers, performed duets with professional vocalists to support their chosen charity. Ryan and Sebastian were the last team to be eliminated, making them the runners-up in the competition. She was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.AIS at the Olympics As of May 2009 Sarah Ryan started working for the YMCA of Sydney at Mount Annan Leisure Centre as a Learn-to- swim teacher and swim coach. Sarah now works for Mater Dei, an organization that provides early intervention therapy services and education for babies, children and young people with an intellectual disability or developmental delay.

Description IEDs receive data from sensors and power equipment and can issue control commands, such as tripping circuit breakers if they sense voltage, current, or frequency anomalies, or raise/lower voltage levels in order to maintain the desired level. Common types of IEDs include protective relaying devices, On Load Tap Changer controllers, circuit breaker controllers, capacitor bank switches, recloser controllers, voltage regulators etc. This is generally controlled by a setting file. The testing of setting files is typically one of the most time-consuming roles of a protection tester. Digital protective relays are primarily IEDs, using a microprocessor to perform several protective, control and similar functions. A typical IED can contain around 5-12 protection functions, 5-8 control functions controlling separate devices, an autoreclose function, self monitoring function, communication functions etc. Hence, they are aptly named as Intelligent Electronic Devices. Some recent IEDs are designed to support the IEC61850 standard for substation automation, which provides interoperability and advanced communications capabilities.

Assemblymen were prominent men, usually of the aristocracy, and included royal princes, peers, archbishops, high-ranking judges, and, in some cases, major town officials. The king would issue one or more reforming edicts after hearing their advice.Collins, p. xix This group met in 1583, 1596‚Äì97, 1617, 1626, 1787, and 1788. Like the Estates-General, they served a consultative purpose only. But unlike the Estates-General, whose members were elected by the subjects of the realm, the assemblymen were selected by the king for their \\"zeal\\", \\"devotion\\", and their \\"trustworthiness\\" toward the sovereign.Mousnier, p. 229 In addition, assembly of notables can refer to an expanded version of the King's Council (Curia regis). Several times a year, whenever the king needed to cast a wider net to gather information for making important decisions or preparing edicts and ordinances, he would enlarge his Council with prominent men chosen for their social and professional standing or their skills to give counsel on the matters at hand. The role of the assembly was to advise the king on how to remedy governance issues brought up by the Estates-General. 1583 assembly In November 1583, Henry III convened an assembly of notables at Saint Germain-en-Laye to address religious demonstrations that threatened the collapse of the State. In the assembly, Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon called for a religious monopoly in France; he said that if this was offered, the clergy would sell their shirts to support the king.Sutherland, p. 54 Henry, however, angrily interrupted him, knowing the origin of that hostile demand; any attempt to impose one religion was unthinkable while Anjou remained attached to the Netherlands. Henry replied that he had already risked his life and estate to establish a single religion, but since he had been forced to sue for peace, he would not breach it.  1596 assembly  Following the regicide of Henry III, his successor was Henry IV who learned from the experience of Henry III. He himself had called on the assembly's assistance in 1596‚Äì97 at Rouen. The assemblymen were summoned to assist in developing and authorizing new taxation plans for the country to tackle the debt. There were 95 notables present, and they recommended that the king levy a special sales tax of 5% on all sales‚Äîwith the exception of wheat, to avoid bread riots. It was estimated that this pancarte would raise 5 million French pounds (livres), but in its best year it raised only 1.56 million pounds. Although the tax raised less than predicted, it did restore the royal budget to solvency. King Henry and the Duke of Sully had come up with many other possible ways to raise money, but the key to rescuing the monarchy from bankruptcy was simply to ensure that the system of taxation worked efficiently.Baumgartner, p. 233  1626 assembly  In 1626 Louis XIII called together an assembly consisting of the government's ruling elite‚Äî13 grandees, 13 bishops, and 29 judges. Many historians have regarded this assembly, and its predecessors, as unsuccessful because they failed to enact specific reforms, but this view fails to consider the assemblies' role. The assemblies had no legislative or administrative powers; instead, they served to provide considered advice on government reform proposals and to make appropriate counter-proposals. In the case of every successful assembly, the king himself would issue a major ordinance or enact significant reforms, most notably the Edict of Blois 1579, in response to the Estates-General of 1576, and the great Code Michau 1629, in response to the Assembly of Notables of 1626‚Äì27.Collins, p. 47 The king and the notables agreed on four basic changes in French government. First, they agreed that Protestant power had to be broken. There was no specific discussion of a march on La Rochelle, but the notables firmly supported the king's desire to destroy the network of independent Huguenot fortresses. Second, the notables, like those of 1596 and 1617, strongly criticized the grandees, particularly provincial governors. In 1626‚Äì27, the notables insisted in particular that the king should regain full control of the military. Third, everyone agreed that the basic administration of the kingdom lay in disarray, so that a strong statement from the central government was needed to reestablish order. In most cases, this reaffirmation of government control required only the restatement of pre-existing ordinances. Fourth, everyone agreed that the fiscal situation was catastrophic. The overwhelming majority of the assembly's deliberations focused on this last issue.Collins, pp. 47‚Äì48  1787 assembly  The final appearance of the Assembly of Notables began in February 1787 during Louis XVI's reign, during which France‚Äôs finances were in a desperate situation and the finance ministers of the day (Turgot, Necker, Calonne) all believed that tax reform was necessary if France was going to pay off its debt and bring government expenditure back into line with government income. However, before any new tax laws could be passed, they first had to be registered with the French parlements (which were high courts, not legislatures, but that possessed a limited veto power on new laws). Repeated attempts to implement tax reform failed due to lack of parlement support, as parlement judges felt that any increase in tax would have a direct negative effect on their own income. In response to this opposition, the finance minister at the time, Calonne, suggested that Louis XVI call an Assembly of Notables. While the Assembly of Notables had no legislative power in its own right, Calonne hoped that if the Assembly of Notables could be made to support the proposed reforms then this would apply pressure on parlement to register them. Calonne proposed four major reforms: # a single land-value tax # the conversion of the corv√©e into a money tax # the abolition of internal tariffs # the creation of elected provincial assemblies In the traditional view, the plan failed because the 144 assemblymen, who included princes of the blood, archbishops, noblemen and other people from the traditional elite, did not wish to bear the burden of increased taxation. However, Simon Schama has argued that the notables in fact were quite open to radical political changes; for example, some proposed the elimination of all the tax exemptions conferred by noble status; others proposed lowering the income qualifications for voting for members of the proposed provincial assemblies. Schama wrote: > Yet what was truly astonishing about the debates of the Assembly is that > they were marked by a conspicuous acceptance of principles like fiscal > equality that even a few years before would have been unthinkable....Where > disagreement occurred, it was not because Calonne had shocked the Notables > with his announcement of a new fiscal and political world; it was either > because he had not gone far enough or because they disliked the operational > methods built into the program. In addition, the Assembly insisted that the proposed reforms should actually be presented to a representative body such as the Estates-General. Opposition in the Assembly combined with intrigues from rival ministers led to Calonne's disgrace and he was subsequently dismissed by Louis XVI on 8 April 1787. In addition to tax reform, the Assembly also discussed other issues. The result was that the Assembly assisted the Parliament in creating provincial assemblies, reestablished free trade in grain, converted the corv√©e (a feudal duty in the form of forced labour) into a cash payment, and generated short- term loans.Collins, p. 258 Calonne's successor, Lom√©nie de Brienne, dissolved the body on 25 May.

Its construction was completed in 1977. The skyscraper has an unusual appearance, being built atop an 11-story, concrete pedestal base that tapers towards ground level, like an inverted pyramid. Beneath the tower was Rainier Square, an underground shopping mall connecting with One Union Square, which is owned by the University of Washington (UW). This shopping center was demolished in 2017. Both the mall and tower were originally named after Rainier Bank, which was merged in the 1980s into Security Pacific, which was eventually merged into Bank of America. The tower was named after Security Pacific in 1989 until UW chose to rename it back to the more familiar \\"Rainier Tower\\" in 1995. Locals often refer to it as the \\"Beaver Building\\" as its physical appearance looks like a tree being felled by a beaver. It had also been referred to as the \\"golf tee\\" building.

It usually consists of two pieces of rectangular cloth, often woven by hand, which is sewn together to form a poncho or shawl like garment, which is usually worn hanging off the shoulders. It can be of various cloths, often with intricate weaves and highly decorated, most often with embroidery. In the pre Hispanic period only women of high social rank could wear it. Since the colonial period, it has been adopted by various peoples, mostly living in central Mexico for everyday wear, festival and rituals, but its use has declined. Definition and wearing of the garment Two ways of wearing a quechquemitl, on the head and on the shoulders. The one of the shoulders is of the curved type It has been variously described as a shawl, a cape and a triangular cloth. It is not really any of these although when worn points front and back it has a triangular appearance. Most quechquemitls are two pieces of rectangular cloth sewn together and most often worn off the shoulders, covering the upper body of women. Most have points which can hang down the front and back or over the arms. Quechquemitls are generally worn with various other garments such as a wraparound skirt tied with a sash, huipil and blouse. The size of the quechquemitl depends on how it is to be worn as well as its relation to other pieces of clothing. Its effect on the overall outfit is determined on this relationship, rather than standing along as a long huipil can. The garment is used for everyday wear, social and ritual occasions. The garment is found mostly in central Mexico among indigenous women such as the Huastecs, Nahuas, Tepehuas, Otomis, Totonacs, Mazahuas, Pames and Huichols in states such as Nayarit, Jalisco, Quer√©taro, the State of Mexico, Hidalgo, Puebla and Veracruz. It has also been seen in some other areas such as the Uruapan area in Michoac√°n, and parts of Morelos, Guerrero and Oaxaca. While it used to be worn as the only upper garment, this practice has almost entirely disappeared, and today it is usually worn over a blouse for decoration or warmth. However, the popularity of highly decorated blouses has led to a diminishing of the quechquemitl. Only among the Totonacs, Otomis and Nahuas is the garment widely used, but even with these it is mostly found on older women. Younger women from the same communities prefer commercial blouses and shirts, reserving the quechquemitl for market days and festivals. In some areas, the quechquemitl is also worn as a head covering. Among the Tepehuas in Huehuetla, Hidalgo, this kind of quechquemitl is made with a fine gauze. Making of the garment Quechquemitl from Hidalgo at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City Peoples noted for the making of quechquemilts include the Huastecs, the Nahuas, the Tepehuas, the Huichols and the Otomis and the decoration of the garment can identify from which group it comes. However, the climate of the region it is made also has an effect such as the use of wool in colder areas. There is evidence that a number of motifs dates back to the pre Hispanic period. Others were adopted after the Spanish conquest, and a number are hard to date as they show both European and indigenous influence. Ancient designs include fretwork, a symbol for Quetzalcoatl, the scepter of Quetzalcoatl, related to Ursa Major, an ‚ÄúS‚Äù form called an ilhuitl and a cross with branches of equal length which represents the cardinal directions. Colors have symbolic meaning such as yellow for east. One European element is a stylized vase with flowers, but the double headed eagle, can be of either indigenous or European origin. The Huastecs in Tancanhuitz de Santos, San Luis Potos√≠ and the Huichols in Jalisco and Nayarit make their quechquemitls in an undyed cotton, which is heavily embroidered with flowers and animals in various colors. The Nahuas of San Francisco Chapantla, Hidalgo and Hueyapan, Puebla decorate their huipils with fretwork, animals and flowers. Among the Huastecs the garment is usually of undyed cotton which is heavily embroidered. Like other indigenous garments, the quechquemitl is made from uncut pieces of cloths as they come off the loom. Quechquemitl designs are achieved through weaving (fiber, color, structure), surface ornamentation (usually embroidery) and finishes applied to the seams and edges. Various kinds of weaves are done for quechquemitls includes gauze, seersucker, brocade and curved or shaped weaving. The finest gauze pieces are from the Sierra Norte de Puebla, with very complex arrangements of heddles, often with six used and as many as twenty have been noted. These gauze weavings tend to be more complex than those used for huipils. Some appear as a checkerboard pattern. Seersucker is used by adding commercial threads in stripes along with the handspun threads. The commercial threads do not shrink when washed and the puckering effect is created. Weft brocade is a decorative technique where heavier threads are introduced in the weft to create patterns. A looped brocade is also created by tugging on these weft threads to raise them. These brocades are often mistaken as embroidery in both Mexican and Guatemalan textiles. The curved weaving technique is particularly complicated and unique. Part of the warp is of white cotton and part a colored wool, either red or pink. The wool warp is much longer than the cotton at a point in the weaving producing warp faced fabric. The wool warp is cult and used as weft in a weft faced band, given the look of a colored border. The curvature is designed to fall on the shoulders of the wearer. This type of garment can be found in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region. There are three methods of joining the pieces of cloth. The first uses two rectangles of cloth with the narrow end of each joined to the long side of the other. This creates a warped loop whose points can be worn front/back or over the shoulders. Another is made with one long rectangle which is folded in half for a square look. The fold goes over one arm the edges going over the other arm are partially sewn, leaving space for the head to pass. A variation on this is two squares of fabric with the arm/shoulder seams sewn, leaving a neck opening. Another variation which is rare is made from a single rectangle from which a smaller rectangle has been cut. Then folded over, the two narrowest edges are sewn. It is worn with points hanging off the shoulders. History An Otomi decorative element from the Sierra Norte de Puebla The name ‚Äúquechquemitl‚Äù (sometimes spelled quesquemitl, quezquemitl or quexquemitl) comes from Nahuatl and means ‚Äúneck garment‚Äù (quechtli = neck and tlaquemitl = garment) . It has other names in other indigenous languages such as thayemlaab among the Huastecs. The garment has pre Hispanic origins and has been worn by some indigenous women for about 2,000 years. It is most likely that the garment originated with the Totonacs on the Gulf coast. It was brought to the Mexican highlands by the Otomis. In the pre Hispanic era, the quechquemitl was worn with huipil and a wrap around skirt, generally only for special occasions and by high-ranking women. It may even have been reserved for use by goddesses and those portraying them in ritual in the Aztec era. In this era, it was particularly associated with fertility goddesses possibly due to the origins of the garment in the Gulf Coast region and its fertility. These garments when worn by the nobility were made of cotton, sometimes with rabbit fur or feathers woven in for warmth and/or decoration. There was another variation in which the cloth was twisted before the edges sewn, resulting in a shape that conformed closer to the body. The name of Mixtec princesses often had the word ‚Äúquechquemitl‚Äù. The garments were woven on backstrap looms, which can still be seen today, and dyed with natural colorings such as cochineal, indigo and other plants, animals and minerals. After the Spanish conquest, the quechquemitl was adopted by all indigenous women. The garment was then worn alone, exposing the midriff or over a huipil. However, today neither of these uses are common. Treadle looms and spinning wheels were also introduced and well as sheep producing wool. Today, the quechquemitl is still worn but its use has diminished. However, it remains important in Mexican culture. Frida Kahlo, who was known for her wearing of Mexican indigenous clothing, had quechquemetls, including one from Puebla with symbols related to fertility which are no longer made. There have been conferences and other academic events devoted to the garment, such as a CONACULTA sponsored conference at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a . and a conference on its use in Nahua and Huastec identities at the Centro de las Artes in San Luis Potos√≠.

He is a prominent figure in the Tamil literary world. A master's graduate from the Pachaiyappa's College in Chennai, he first worked as a translator, while also being a published poet. He entered the Tamil film industry in the year 1980, with the film Nizhalgal, an Ilaiyaraaja musical, directed by Bharathiraja. During the course of his 40-year film career, he has written over 7,500 songs and poems which have won him seven National Awards, the most for any Indian lyricist. He has also been honored with a Padma Shri, a Padma Bhushan and a Sahitya Akademi Award, for his abundant literary output. Early life Vairamuthu was born on July 13, 1953 to Ramasamy and his wife Angammal, who were agriculturalists based in the village of Mettoor, in the district of Theni, Tamil Nadu. In 1957, his family was forced to move to Vadugapatti, another village in the Theni district, due to the construction of Vaigai Dam across the river Vaigai, which led to evacuation of 14 villages (including Mettur). In his new surroundings, he also took up agriculture in addition to his academics. From a very young age, Vairamuthu was drawn towards the language and literature of Tamil. The Dravidian movement in Tamil Nadu during the 1960s, made a significant impression on his youth and he was inspired by several prominent individuals associated with language, such as Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, 'Perarignar' Annadurai, Kalaignar Mu. Karunanidhi, Subramania Bharathi, Bharathidasan and Kannadasan. He began writing poems from the age of ten and by his early teens, he was noted as a prominent orator and poet in his school. At the age of fourteen, he wrote a group of venba poems, having been inspired by Thiruvalluvar‚Äôs Tirukku·πõa·∏∑. =Education and early career= During the stint of his under-graduation at Pachaiyappa‚Äôs College in Chennai, he was acclaimed as a speaker and poet. In his sophomore year, he published his first anthology of poems, titled Vaigarai Megangal ('Clouds at Dawn'), at the age of nineteen. The book was prescribed as part of the curriculum in the Women's Christian College, giving Vairamuthu the distinction of being a writer whose work was part of a syllabus, while he was still a student. He completed a 2 year Master's program in Arts in the field of Tamil literature at the Madras University. After his education, he began his professional career at the Tamil Nadu Official Language Commission in the mid-1970s, as a translator of law books and documents from English to Tamil, working under Justice Maharajan. In addition to this, he continued writing poetry, bringing out a second anthology of poems in 1979, titled Thiruthi Ezhuthiya Theerpugal ('Revised and rewritten'). =Family and personal life= He is married to Ponmani, a Tamil scholar and former professor at the Meenakshi College for Women. They have two sons, Madhan Karky and Kabilan, who both work as lyricists and dialogue writers for Tamil films. Film career =Debut and early years= Upon reading his poems, he was signed on as a lyricist by the director Bharathiraja for the film Nizhalgal in the year 1980. The first song he wrote in his career, was \\"Pon Maalai Pozhuthu\\", which was composed by \\"Isaignani\\" Ilaiyaraaja and sung by S.P. Balasubrahmanyam. The first song of his that was released, was \\"Batrakali Uttamaseeli\\" (also composed by Ilaiyaraaja) from the film Kaali, which was released four months before Nizhalgal. Vairamuthu quit his career as a translator to work full-time in the film industry. After Nizhalgal, Vairamuthu and Ilaiyaraaja kicked off a successful collaboration which would last a little more than half a decade. Their joint association with director Bharathiraja, led to some of the most critically acclaimed soundtracks such as Alaigal Oivathillai (which won Vairamuthu his first Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Lyricist), Kaadhal Oviyam, Mann Vasanai, Pudhumai Penn, Oru Kaidhiyin Diary, Muthal Mariyathai (which won Vairamuthu his first National Award for Best Lyricist) and Kadalora Kavithaigal. During the period he was working with Ilaiyaraaja, Vairamuthu collaborated with director Mani Ratnam for the first time in Idhaya Kovil in 1985, penning the song \\"Naan Padum Mouna Ragam\\" (which inspired the title of Ratnam's breakthrough Mouna Ragam, which was released in the following year). Besides their work with Bharathiraja, the combination of the lyricist and the composer tasted success with more soundtracks such as Raja Paarvai, Ninaivellam Nithya, Nallavanukku Nallavan, Salangai Oli and Sindhu Bhairavi (the latter two yielding Ilaiyaraaja his first two National Awards for Music Direction). Vairamuthu also worked as a lyricist with composer M.S. Viswanathan on the film Thanneer Thanneer and V.S. Narasimhan on the films Achamillai Achamillai and Kalyana Agathigal. All three films were directed by K. Balachander. In 1986, he debuted as screenwriter for the film Natpu, directed by Ameerjan. He later had three further collaborations as a writer with the director in Thulasi (1987), Vanna Kanavugal (1987) and Vanakkam Vathiyare (1991). He also penned the dialogues for Andru Peytha Mazhaiyil (1989), which was directed by the National award-winning cinematographer Ashok Kumar. =Split with Ilaiyaraaja= After K. Balachander's Punnagai Mannan (1986), Vairamuthu and Ilaiyaraaja parted ways. After their split, Vairamuthu's career stalled for the next five years, when he worked largely on lyrics for other language films that were dubbed in Tamil. His association with director Bharathiraja remained intact, as the duo worked together in the late 1980s on films such as Vedham Pudhithu (composed by Devendran) and Kodi Parakuthu (composed by Hamsalekha). He also worked with Bollywood composers such as R. D. Burman in the film Ulagam Pirandhadhu Enakkaga and the duo Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal on Uyire Unakkaga. During this time, he also collaborated with composer Chandrabose on the films Shankar Guru, Makkal En Pakkam, Manithan, Katha Nayagan, Thaimel Aanai, Paatti Sollai Thattathe, Vasanthi, Raja Chinna Roja and Sugamana Sumaigal. They last worked together on Aadhikkam, which was released in 2005. =Resurgence= In 1991, K. Balachander signed Vairamuthu as a lyricist for three of his productions, which were set for release in the following year: Vaaname Ellai, Annamalai and Roja. The first film (directed by Balachander himself) was composed by M.M. Keeravani (credited as 'Maragadhamani' in Tamil), the second (directed by Suresh Krissna) had music scored by Deva, and the third (directed by Mani Ratnam) by a debuting composer named A.R. Rahman. Roja was director Mani Ratnam's first film after his split with composer Ilaiyaraaja, and its music is widely regarded as changing the face of not just Tamil, but Indian music. The song \\"Chinna Chinna Aasai\\", the first film song which Rahman had composed, won Vairamuthu his second National award for the Best Lyricist. The album secured A.R. Rahman the National Award for the Best Music Direction, a first for a debutant. Following Roja, the combination of A.R. Rahman and Vairamuthu became heavily sought after, collaborating on several films throughout the next 25 years. Their continued association with director Mani Ratnam (which spans the length of Rahman's career), led to critical and commercial success on films such as Thiruda Thiruda (1993), Bombay (1995), Alaipayuthey (2000), Kannathil Muthamittal (2002), Aayutha Ezhuthu (2004), Raavanan (2010), Kadal (2013), O Kadhal Kanmani (2015). Kaatru Veliyidai (2017) and Chekka Chivantha Vaanam (2018). Four out of Vairamuthu's seven National awards for the Best Lyricist came out of his association with Rahman (on films such as Roja, Karuththamma, Pavithra; he was recognized by the National awards committee for his efforts on both these films in 1995, Sangamam and Kannathil Muthamittal) and four out of Rahman's six National Awards came from his association with Vairamuthu (on the films Roja, Minsara Kanavu, Kannathil Muthamittal and Kaatru Veliyidai). Singers P. Unnikrishnan, S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, Shankar Mahadevan, Swarnalatha, K.S. Chitra and Shashaa Tirupati have all won National awards for their work in collaboration with this duo. In addition to their association with Mani Ratnam, the team of Rahman and Vairamuthu are also noted for their collaboration with director Shankar (on Gentleman, Kadhalan, Indian, Jeans, Mudhalvan, Sivaji, and Enthiran), Bharathiraja (on Kizhakku Cheemayile, Karuththamma, Anthimanthaarai and Taj Mahal), K. S. Ravikumar (on Muthu, Padayappa and Varalaru) and Rajiv Menon (on Minsara Kanavu and Kandukonden Kandukonden). Some of their other popular films include Pudhiya Mugam, Duet, May Madham, Rhythm, Kochadaiiyaan, and 24. Vairamuthu is also known for his work in the 90s and early 2000s with composer Deva, on popular soundtracks such as Annamalai, Baasha, Aasai, Once More, Arunachalam, Nerukku Ner, Vaali, Kushi, and Panchathanthiram. He has also worked extensively with Bharadwaj on popular soundtracks such as Kaadhal Mannan , Pooveli , Amarkalam , Rojavanam , Parthen Rasithen , Rojakootam , Gemini , Jay Jay , Attagasam , Vasool Raja MBBS , Idhaya Thirudan ,'' Vattaram , Asal , Aayirathil Iruvar , Harris Jayaraj, D.

Raghunanthan (which secured him his sixth National Award for the film Thenmerku Paruvakaatru) and Yuvan Shankar Raja (the son of Ilaiyaraaja; their association yielded him his seventh National Award for the film Dharma Durai). During his nearly 40-year career, he has worked with over 150 music directors. In addition to lyrics, Vairamuthu has also penned poems which feature as part of the dialogue, on films such as Duet, Iruvar (for the character played by Prakash Raj), and Aalavandhan (for the character of Nandu; played by Kamal Haasan). He has also penned lyrics for the theme songs of many Tamil television shows and jingles for advertisements, the most notable among them being the theme for the Tamil soap opera Chithi.

A loan issued under such circumstances may be referred to as a NINA loan or NINJA loan. NINA programs are ostensibly created for those with hard to verify incomes (waiters, etc.) but in actuality have been popularly used in situations where aggressive mortgage lenders and brokers did not want any trouble qualifying otherwise non-qualifying loans, thus becoming a significant factor in the subprime lending crisis. A significant number of NINA loans were never possible for the applicant to repay and have resulted in defaults for this reason, as laid out in detail by investigative reporters, including the reporting of This American Life and Planet Money that culminated in the Peabody- and Polk- award winning episode \\"The Giant Pool of Money.\\" No income, no job, no assets (\\"NINJA\\") A NINJA loan is a nickname for very low-quality subprime loans. It was a play on NINA, which in turn is based on the notation scheme for the level of documentation the mortgage originator required. It was described as a no income, no job, [and] no assets loan because the only thing an applicant had to show was his/her credit rating, which was presumed to reflect willingness and ability to pay. The term was popularized by Charles R. Morris in his 2008 book The Two Trillion Dollar Meltdown, though the acronym had been publicly used by some subprime mortgage lenders for some years. They were especially prominent during the United States housing bubble circa 2003-2007 but have gained wider notoriety due to the subprime mortgage crisis in July/August 2007 as a prime example of poor lending practices. The term grew in usage during the 2008 financial crisis as the sub prime mortgage crisis was blamed on such loans. It works on two levels ‚Äì as an acronym; and allusion to the fact that NINJA loans are often defaulted on, with the borrower disappearing like a ninja. The term was also popularized in the 2010 US film Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps by the character Gordon Gekko played by Michael Douglas.

It is located 173 kilometers to the northeast of Yemen's capital, Sana'a. The population of Marib Governorate comprises 1.2% of the country's total population. The city of Marib is the capital of the governorate, and was established after the discovery of oil deposits in 1984. Marib Governorate borders Al Jawf Governorate to the north, Al Bayda Governorate to the south, Shabwah Governorate to the southeast, Hadhramaut Governorate to the east, and Sana'a Governorate to the west. Ma'rib Governorate's area is approximately , divided among 14 districts. Ma'rib District is the biggest district by area. Ma'rib's population in 2004 was 241,619. As of 28 April 2020, it is the only governorate of North Yemen controlled by the internationally recognized Government of Yemen. Climate The governorate's climate varies based on elevation. The mountainous and elevated regions, which make up the western half of the governorate, are dominated by a moderate climate with hot summers and relatively cold winters. In the low-lying and plain regions, the climate is hot in the summers and moderate in the winters. The desert regions are characterized by a dry climate: hot in the summers, and cold and dry in the winters. Summer rains fall on most parts of the governorate, but the amount of rainfall is usually small, especially in the eastern parts. Most parts of Ma'rib Governorate suffer from drought, given the sparse rainfall. Agriculture and economy Marib Dam In the 1980s, after the region was hit by floods, a dam was constructed in Marib, which would later be deemed to be important for the country's agriculture and economy. Its construction was financed by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, who himself was reportedly a descendant of people from this area. The area is home to the largest gas-fired power plant in Yemen, the Marib Gas Plant, whose electricity towers have been sabotaged continuously since the beginning of 2011. These sabotage operations did not stop until 2014, due to the inability of the Basindawa government to deter the saboteurs. Agriculture is the main livelihood for the governorate's residents. Marib Governorate ranks third in Yemen behind Al Hudaydah Governorate and Sana'a Governorate in terms of agricultural production, making up 7.6% of the country's total agricultural production. Its most important agricultural products are fruits, grains, and vegetables. Many types of livestock are found in the governorate, including cattle, camels, sheep, goats, donkeys, and poultry. There are also quite a number of beehives. According to statistics for the time period 2007-11, the governorate was home to approximately 1,943,564 sheep, approximately 1,669,370 goats, roughly 42,000 cattle, and about 112,782 camels, which make up 3.80% of Yemen's total livestock. Flora and fauna Vegetation in the governorate is diverse, despite its sparseness and lack of density in terms of quantity and quality from place to place, depending on the nature of the surface and prevailing climate. The most important trees are the Christ's thorn jujube, qard tree, buckthorn, acacia (particularly or including the umbrella thorn acacia, as well as other thorny trees. There are also many types of grasses and small plants that grow in the rainy seasons. Many types of wild animals are present in the governorate, and are plentiful in the western areas, including hyenas, snakes, wild rabbits, hedgehogs, and hyraxes. Birds include falcons, pigeons, eagles, and owls. The birds are numerous in areas dense with trees, as well as near wadis, especially those with water. The presence of the nimr (, leopard) was reported in the Sarawat Mountains.

He captured two subsequent Chinese emperors, and executed them back in Pingyang after forcing them to act as cupbearers. These raids finally forced the Chinese to move their capital from Luoyang to Nanjing. Liu Cong's reign was one filled with contradictions. He was a ruler who was obviously intelligent and capable of logical reasoning, and during his father Liu Yuan's reign, he was a capable general as well. On the other hand, as his reign progressed, he became increasingly cruel, unstable, extravagant, and unable to listen to proper advice. Toward the end of his reign, any official who dared to speak against his actions faced potential death. During his reign, both he and the Han Zhao state displayed great potential, as Han Zhao expanded from a small state occupying modern southern Shanxi to encompassing nearly all of modern Shanxi, Shaanxi, eastern Gansu, and significant portions of Shandong, Hebei, and Henan‚Äîalthough the eastern half of the empire was under the control of the general Shi Le and arguably only nominally under Han Zhao's rule. Liu Cong and his state would never realize their potential.  Early Life and career  Liu Cong was Liu Yuan's fourth son, by his concubine Consort Zhang. When he was young, he was considered both intelligent and strong, and when he studied in the Jin capital Luoyang, his knowledge was said to have impressed the Jin officials Le Guang (Ê®ÇÂª£) and Zhang Hua. Eventually, he was invited by the ambitious Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian to be on his staff, but he was concerned that since his father was on the staff of Sima Ying the Crown Prince, he would be considered to have divided loyalties. He therefore fled to Sima Ying and served as a junior officer. After Liu Yuan declared himself the Prince of Han, thus establishing Han Zhao, in 304, he made Liu Cong one of his key generals and created him the Prince of Chu. In 309, in conjunction with Shi Le, he had a major victory over the Jin general Wang Kuang (ÁéãÊõ†) at Changping (Èï∑Âπ≥, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi). Upon the victory, however, he prematurely tried to advance on Luoyang and was defeated by the Jin general Huan Yan (Ê°ìÂª∂), who tricked him by pretending to surrender. However, several months later, he tried again to capture Luoyang in conjunction with Wang Mi (ÁéãÂΩå), but as he besieged the city, the Jin regent Sima Yue the Prince of Donghai was able to make surprise attacks from inside the city, and Liu Cong suffered several repeated attacks. Liu Yuan then recalled him back to the capital Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩ, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). In summer 310, Liu Yuan grew ill. He created Liu Cong's older brother Liu He (by Empress Huyan) crown prince, and commissioned his other sons Liu Yu (ÂäâË£ï) the Prince of Qi, Liu Long (ÂäâÈöÜ) the Prince of Lu, and Liu Ai (Âäâ‰πÇ) the Prince of Beihai with substantial troops at the capital, in addition to the large army that Liu Cong already had, with intent that they assist Liu He with governance and military matters. A group of officials, both Xiongnu and Han, were given various responsibilities in assisting Liu He. However, three officials were left out‚ÄîLiu He's uncle Huyan You (ÂëºÂª∂Êî∏), Liu Cheng (Âäâ‰πò) -- who had prior grudges with Liu Cong‚Äîand Liu Rui (ÂäâÈä≥) the Prince of Xichang. They were disgruntled, and they persuaded the already suspicious Liu He that he could not be safe if his brothers maintained large forces in or near the capital. Three days after Liu Yuan's death, under Liu He's orders, these officials commenced surprise attacks on Liu He's four brothers‚ÄîLiu Rui against Liu Chong, Huyan You against Liu Yu, Liu Cheng against Liu Long, and Tian Mi (Áî∞ÂØÜ) and Liu Gui (ÂäâÁíø) against Liu Ai. Once Tian and Liu Gui got on the way, however, they did not attack Liu Ai but instead escorted him to alert Liu Cong, who then prepared for the confrontation. Liu Rui withdrew his troops. Over the next two days, Liu Yu and Liu Long were defeated and killed. Two days later, Liu Cong besieged the palace and killed Liu He, Liu Cheng, Liu Rui, and Huyan. After initially offering the throne to Liu Ai, Liu Cong then assumed the throne himself.  Early reign  After Liu Cong took the throne, he created his brother Liu Ai crown prince, promising to eventually give Liu Ai the throne that he offered to Liu Cong instead. He created his wife Princess Huyan empress, and created her son Liu Can the Prince of Jin, putting him in charge of much of his troops, along with his cousin Liu Yao the Prince of Shi'an. Both Liu Yuan's empress Empress Dan and Liu Cong's own mother Consort Zhang were honored as empresses dowager. Later in 310, Crown Prince Ai's mother, Empress Dan died‚Äîsaid to be of shame after her affair with Liu Cong was discovered by her son Liu Ai. After she died, Liu Cong's favor for his brother quickly waned, although he was said to be keeping him as crown prince still because of his love for her. Empress Huyan, however, began to try to persuade him to create Liu Can crown prince instead, and he began to consider the matter. Liu Cong continued to put up pressure against Jin and its capital Luoyang. His generals Liu Yao, Liu Can, Shi Le, and Wang Mi continued to defeat Jin forces that they encountered easily, capturing cities and killing Jin officials, but continued to have difficulty holding cities permanently. However, they rendered the Jin heartland stripped and barren. In spring 311, Shi Le crushed the remaining major Jin force in the central China region, previously commanded by Sima Yue, which was trying to head east after his death. Shi had the Jin officials and generals he captured all executed and burned Sima Yue's body. Luoyang was left defenseless, and at Liu Cong's orders, summer that year, Wang, Shi, Liu Yao, and Huyan Yan converged on Luoyang and captured it and the Emperor Huai of Jin, taking him to the Han Zhao capital Pingyang. This capture of Jin capital is known as the Disaster of Yongjia. Wang suggested that the capital be moved to Luoyang, but Liu Yao opposed and burned much of Luoyang, and Liu Cong did not seriously consider Wang's suggestion afterwards. In winter 311, Shi ambushed Wang at a feast and seized Wang's troops, and afterwards, while continuing to show outward loyalty to Han Zhao, became effectively independent. Indeed, his intent from that point on appeared to be enlarging his own personal dominion. In spring 312, Empress Huyan died. In less than a month, Liu Cong began to take a large number of his high-level officials' daughters and granddaughters as concubines, including a number of them with the family name Liu‚Äîdaughters and granddaughters of his official Liu Yin (ÂäâÊÆ∑) -- which Crown Prince Ai opposed due to the general prohibition against endogamy. However, Liu Cong rationalized that these Liu women were ethnically Han, and he himself was ethnically Xiongnu, and therefore could not have come from the same ancestry. From this point on, Liu Cong was said to have been spending all his time with these women and rarely spent time to handle government matters. Also in spring 312, Liu Cong created the former Jin emperor the Duke of Kuaiji. Once, after inviting the duke to a feast, Liu Cong commented on a meeting they had while the former emperor was still the Prince of Yuzhang, leading to a notable colloquy in which the duke skillfully flattered the Han Zhao emperor. The next day, Liu Cong gave one of his favorite concubines, one of Liu Yin's granddaughters, to the duke as a gift, creating her as the Duchess of Kuaiji. In summer 312, the first real signs of trouble of Liu Cong's reign came, as he executed a prince in charge of river matters and a duke in charge of construction on trivial matters‚Äîthe prince for failing to supply his court with sufficient fish and crabs, and the duke for failing to complete two palaces on time. When the general Wang Zhang (ÁéãÂΩ∞) tried to persuade him to control his behavior, he became enraged and wanted Wang killed, but imprisoned Wang after Wang's daughter, a concubine of his, interceded. Later, he regretted his actions and released and promoted Wang, but this incident started a pattern of impulsive actions, often with cruelty, that would plague the rest of Liu Cong's reign. Later in summer 312, Liu Cong wanted to create Liu Yin's daughter Liu Ying (ÂäâËã±) empress to replace Empress Huyan, but at his mother Empress Dowager Zhang's insistence, he created another concubine, Empress Zhang Huiguang‚Äîa daughter of his cousin Zhang Shi (ÂºµÂØî‚Äînot to be confused with the contemporaneous Jin official of the same name, whose domain later evolved into Former Liang) -- empress. In fall 312, Han Zhao forces, under Liu Can and Liu Yao, dealt a serious blow to the Jin general Liu Kun (ÂäâÁê®) the governor of Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, modern northern and central Shanxi), who had been a constant threat to Han Zhao, capturing Liu Kun's headquarters at Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) and killing Liu Kun's parents. While Liu Kun was able to recapture Jinyang with the assistance of the Xianbei chief Tuoba Yilu the Duke of Dai, he would not pose a serious threat to Han Zhao from that point on. In spring 313, an incident would lead to Liu Cong's execution of the former Jin emperor, the Duke of Kuaiji. At the imperial new year celebration, Liu Cong ordered him to serve the high-level officials wine, and former Jin officials Yu Min (Â∫æÁèâ) and Wang Juan (ÁéãÈõã) could not control their emotions at seeing his humiliation, and cried out loud. This made Liu Cong angry, and he falsely accused Yu and Wang, along with a number of former Jin officials, of being ready to betray Pingyang and offer it to Liu Kun. He then executed those former Jin officials and poisoned the former emperor. He took the Duchess of Kuaiji, formerly awarded to the duke, back as a concubine. Later in spring 313, Liu Cong's mother Empress Dowager Zhang died. Her grandniece, Empress Zhang, was so depressed and mournful after the empress dowager's death that she died as well. Liu Cong created Liu Yin's daughter Liu E to replace her, and ordered that a palace be built for her. His minister Chen Yuanda (Èô≥ÂÖÉÈÅî) tried to persuade that it was overly wasteful, and Liu Cong, in anger, ordered Chen's execution. However, the new empress interceded, and Chen was spared and further promoted. For the next year, under Empress Liu's and Chen's advice, Liu Cong was said to have corrected his behavior to some extent. In summer 313, the nephew of the deceased Emperor Huai of Jin, Sima Ye, declared himself emperor (as Emperor Min of Jin) in Chang'an, but due to the weakness in his forces did not pose a serious threat to Han Zhao. Still, this move drew Liu Cong's attention, and for the next several years, Chang'an would become a major target for Han Zhao forces. In spring 314, Empress Liu died, and it was said that from that point on, Liu Cong's palace would be thoroughly in a confused state, and Liu Cong's own personal behavior appeared to degenerate after this, without her counsel.  Late reign  In 314, Liu Cong made his son Liu Can the prime minister, with paramount powers. This brought fear in the heart of his brother, the crown prince Liu Ai, whose associates subsequently suggested in 315 that he start a coup and overthrow Liu Cong. Liu Ai did not agree to the plot, but news leaked anyway. Liu Cong put Liu Ai under house arrest. Later in 315, Liu Cong took two of his general Jin Zhun's daughters, Jin Yueguang (Èù≥ÊúàÂÖâ) and Jin Yuehua (Èù≥ÊúàËèØ) into his palace, and created three empresses‚ÄîJin Yueguang as Upper Empress, Jin Yuehua as Right Empress, and Consort Liu (might have been Liu Yin's granddaughter) Left Empress‚Äîagainst the custom that an emperor should only be one empress for the emperor at one time. Later that year, Chen Yuanda revealed to him that the Upper Empress had been committing adultery, and Liu Cong felt compelled to depose her; she committed suicide in shame, and Liu Cong, missing her beauty, greatly resented Chen for revealing her adultery. In fall 315, Liu Cong, to appease the ever growing power of Shi Le, commissioned Shi with imperial powers in the eastern empire (which Shi controlled in any case). Around this time, he also became extremely trusting of the eunuchs Wang Chen (ÁéãÊ≤à), Xuan Huai (ÂÆ£Êá∑), and the servant Guo Yi (ÈÉ≠Áåó), entrusting all government matters to them and cancelling regular meetings with officials, letting Wang, Xuan, and Guo serve as communicators between him and the officials. This led to Wang, Xuan, and Guo becoming free to act at their whim, and they became greatly corrupt, in cooperation with Jin Zhun. A number of officials who dared to speak out against these men were executed. Both Guo and Jin had prior grudges against Crown Prince Ai, and they persuaded Liu Can into believing that Crown Prince Ai would try to depose Liu Cong and kill him, presenting Liu Can with false evidence of such a plot. Liu Can therefore began to plot how to remove his uncle. In fall 316, Liu Cong sent Liu Yao to attack Chang'an, and Liu Yao captured it and the Jin emperor, sending him to Pingyang, thus ending the so-called Western Jin Dynasty (although Jin would not actually end, as its Prince of Langye, Sima Rui, then safely south of the Yangtze River at Jiankang would claim the title \\"Prince of Jin\\" in 317 and declare himself emperor in 318, thus continuing Jin as the so-called Eastern Jin Dynasty). Liu Cong created the former Jin emperor the Marquess of Huai'an, and he created Liu Yao the Prince of Qin and put him in charge of the western empire. Around the new year of 317, Shi Le defeated Liu Kun and took over his domain of Jin's Bing Province. While this finally ended a former threat against Han Zhao, Shi's power became even stronger and independent of Liu Cong's. In spring 317, Liu Can finally readied his plan to eliminate his uncle Crown Prince Ai. He falsely informed Crown Prince Ai that Pingyang was under attack and that his subordinates should arm themselves to prepare for the attack. Then, Liu Can informed his father that Crown Prince Ai was ready to attack‚Äîand when Liu Cong's messengers then saw Crown Prince's associates armed, they believed Liu Can's accusations and reported back to Liu Cong. Liu Can then further interrogated Crown Prince Ai's subordinate Di and Qiang chiefs (whom Crown Prince Ai commanded, based on his secondary title of Grand Chanyu) under torture, and the Di and Qiang chiefs were forced to falsely confess to a plot. Crown Prince Ai's associates and troops were all massacred‚Äîestimated at the cost of 15,000 men‚Äîand Crown Prince Ai was deposed and subsequently assassinated by Jin. When Di and Qiang tribes subsequently revolted due to the treatment of their chiefs, Liu Cong sent Jin to suppress them, and Jin was successful. In fall 317, Liu Cong created Liu Can crown prince. In early 318, at a feast, Liu Cong had the former Jin emperor, the Marquess of Huai'an serve as butler, and a number of former Jin officials could not control themselves and cried out loud at their former emperor's humiliation. Further, around this time, there were a number of uprisings against Han Zhao, each claiming to want to capture Liu Can to exchange him for the former Jin emperor. Liu Can therefore recommended that Sima Ye be executed, and Liu Cong agreed, executing him after receiving Liu Can's report. In summer 318, an imperial meeting hall in Pingyang was destroyed by a great fire, and it killed 21 people, including Liu Cong's son Liu Kang (ÂäâÂ∫∑) the Prince of Kuaiji. Liu Cong was said to have greatly mourned his son, and this appeared to have a terrible effect on his health. He summoned Liu Yao and Shi Le to the capital to serve as regents, but both Liu Yao and Shi declined. He died soon after, and Liu Can became emperor. Later that year, however, Liu Can would be murdered by Jin, who would then massacre the imperial clan. Liu Yao and Shi defeated Jin and Liu Yao became emperor, but Liu Yao and Shi subsequently had a falling out, leading to Shi declaring independent and creating Later Zhao. The empire that Liu Cong built was torn into halves.

The main concepts of the Cannon‚ÄìBard theory are that emotional expression results from the function of hypothalamic structures, and emotional feeling results from stimulations of the dorsal thalamus. The physiological changes and subjective feeling of an emotion in response to a stimulus are separate and independent; arousal does not have to occur before the emotion. Thus, the thalamic region is attributed a major role in this theory of emotion. The theory is therefore also referred to as the thalamic theory of emotion. Origins Walter Bradford Cannon (1871‚Äì1945) was a physiologist at Harvard University, who is perhaps best known for his classic treatise on homeostasis. Philip Bard (1898‚Äì1977) was a doctoral student of Cannon's, and together they developed a model of emotion called the Cannon‚ÄìBard Theory. Cannon was an experimenter who relied on studies of animal physiology. Through these studies, Cannon and Bard highlighted the role of the brain in generating physiological responses and feelings; a role that is important in their explanation of emotion experience and production. A dominant theory of emotion of Cannon's time was the James‚ÄìLange theory of emotion, and Cannon recognized that to test this theory, an examination of emotional expression with no visceral afferent feedback was required. This was necessary because the link between visceral changes and the feedback required to stimulate cerebral manifestations of an emotion would no longer be present. To do so, Cannon experimented with severing afferent nerves of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system in cats. Cannon compiled his experimental results in 1915, then refined and expanded them, and finally proposed his model of emotion as a challenge and alternative to the James‚ÄìLange theory of emotion. The James‚ÄìLange theory relies on the backflow of impulses from the periphery to account for unique emotional experiences; impulses that William James assumed to come from all parts of the organism, including the muscles, skin, and the viscera. The viscera were attributed a major role by James. The viscera are composed of smooth muscle and glands. Cannon identified and outlined five issues with the James‚ÄìLange theory's notion of the vasomotor center as the explanation of emotional experience. # Total separation of the viscera from the central nervous system does not alter emotional behaviour. #:In an experiment, cats were kept alive and healthy after having their sympathetic nervous systems completely removed. Removal of this system resulted in the abolishment of all the reactions under control of the vasomotor center, the region that the James‚ÄìLange theory purported to be responsible for emotional experiences. However, it was found that destroying these functions had little or no effect on the animals' emotional responses. The cats displayed the typical signs of rage in response to a barking dog, and the animals displayed full emotional expression in all organs that had not had their connections to the brain destroyed. # The same visceral changes occur in very different emotional states and in non-emotional states. #:The sympathetic nervous system functions as a single unit. Visceral changes brought on/caused by sympathetic nervous system action include: increased heart rate; contraction of arterioles; dilatation of bronchioles; increased levels of blood sugar; sweating; widening of the pupils and erection of hairs; and discharge of adrenin. These physiological changes can be seen in great excitement under any circumstances, including in distinguishable emotional states such as fear and rage, as well as situations of fever, asphyxia, and exposure to cold temperatures. Cannon articulated that these responses of the viscera are too uniform to offer a means of distinguishing emotions that have varying subjective qualities. He postulated that if emotions were the result of impulses from the viscera, we could expect fear, rage, chilliness, asphyxia, and fever to feel similarly, which is not the case. #The viscera are relatively insensitive structures. #:Cannon wrote that there is a common belief that the more deeply the body is penetrated, the more sensitive it becomes; however, this is not the case. In the nerves distributed to the viscera the afferent sensory fibers may be only 1/10th as numerous as the efferent sensory fibers. For example, in the case of the viscera, we are unaware of the contractions and relaxations of the digestive processes. Such processes are undemonstrative and beyond our physical awareness, even when marked changes are induced in them. # Visceral changes are too slow to be a source of emotional feeling. #:As previously stated, the viscera are composed of smooth muscle and glands, which are typically sluggish in their responses. It has been found that the latent period of the psychogalvanic response in man is approximately 3 seconds. However, it has also been noted that the latent period of affective responses to photos of men and women can end within 0.8 seconds. The James‚ÄìLange theory contends that such affective responses result from reverberations from the viscera. Cannon pointed out that the time required for nerve impulses to travel from the brain to the periphery and back to the brain again could not occur quickly enough to be the cause of such emotional responses. # Artificial induction of the visceral changes typical of strong emotions does not produce them. #:When adrenalin is injected it induces the physiological responses typical of sympathetic nervous system activity previously discussed (dilation of bronchioles, constriction of blood vessels, increased blood sugar etc.). These changes are typical of intense emotional states. Therefore, if these visceral changes were artificially induced by the injection of adrenalin, one would expect the emotions to follow, as articulated by the James‚ÄìLange theory of emotion. When this experiment was done, participants experienced no specific emotions. However, it was found that an emotional response may develop only when the adrenalin as injected subsequent to discussing with patients their sick children or their dead parents. Thus, injection of adrenalin had an effect when an emotional mood already existed in participants. Further criticisms of the James‚ÄìLange theory William James argued that there were either special centers for cerebral processes that accompany emotion, or they occurred in the ordinary motor and sensory centers of the cortex. Cannon responded by positing that there may not be one or the other, that there may be cortical processes and special centers that accompany emotional responses. He outlined two ideas regarding the existence of two sources of cerebral processes of emotions. ;Emotional expression results from action of subcortical centers. Cannon summarized research done by Bechterev regarding emotional expression. In this research, it was argued that emotional expression must be independent of the cortex because the expression of emotions cannot always be inhibited or controlled (e.g. laughing from being tickled) because visceral changes occur independent of our control, and because these responses, which cannot be inhibited, are seen soon after birth before cortical management is developed. Furthermore, after cerebral hemispheres were removed from animal test subjects, correct affective responses could be elicited by appropriate stimulations. These emotional effects were no longer present when the optic thalamus was removed from the animals; thus, it was concluded that this region plays a significant role in the expression of emotions. Location of the human diencephalon (red), a brain area implicated in the sham rage response in cats studied by Cannon and Britton. To further support the assertion that emotional expression results from action of subcortical centers, Cannon and Britton performed further experimental research with cats. Cats were decorticated, and after a period of recovery they spontaneously displayed the behaviours characteristic of intense fury. This response, referred to as sham rage, continued to be displayed after ablation of all brain regions anterior to the diencephalon. However, once the lower posterior portion of the thalamic region was removed, the display of sham rage by the cats subsided. Based on this finding, it was concluded that the thalamus was a region from which, in the absence of cortical control, impulses are discharged which evoke an extreme degree of \\"emotional\\" activity, both muscular and visceral. Based on these findings and observations, Cannon asserts that the optic thalamus is a region in the brain responsible for the neural organization for the different emotional expressions. ;Thalamic processes are a source of affective experience. There are numerous reported and cited cases of patients with unilateral lesions in the thalamus region who have a tendency to react excessively to affective stimuli. For example, pin pricks, painful pressure, and excessive heat or cold all cause more distress on the damaged side of the body as compared to the normal side. Similar results can be observed from agreeable stimuli: warmth stimuli may cause intense pleasure, demonstrated by facial expressions of enjoyment and exclamations of delight by the individual. The increased influence of stimuli resulting in excessive responses was attributed to the release of the thalamus from cortical inhibition. When the thalamus is released from cortical control, the affective states and responses are increased; thus, it was concluded that the thalamic region is occupied with the affective component of sensation. The Cannon‚ÄìBard theory Location of the human cerebrum (red). Based on the previous discussion of the purported faults regarding the James‚ÄìLange theory of emotion's explanation, Cannon put forward a theory of emotion based on thalamic processes. According to Cannon, an external stimulus activates receptors and this excitation starts impulses toward the cortex. Upon arriving in the cortex, the impulses are associated with conditioned processes that determine the direction of the subsequent response. It is this response that stimulates the thalamic processes. Once the thalamic processes are activated, they are ready to discharge. The thalamic neurons fire in a special combination in a given emotional expression. These neurons then discharge precipitately and intensely. Cannon wrote that within and near the thalamus, the neurons responsible for an emotional expression lie close to the relay in the sensory path from the periphery to the cortex, and when these neurons fire in a particular combination they innervate muscles and viscera and excite afferent paths to the cortex by direct connection or irradiation. The key component of the Cannon‚ÄìBard theory of emotion is that when the thalamic discharge occurs, the bodily changes occur almost simultaneously with the emotional experience. The bodily changes and emotional experience occur separately and independently of one another; physiological arousal does not have to precede emotional expression or experience. The theory asserts that the thalamic region is the brain area responsible for emotional responses to experienced stimuli. Cannon summarises the observations that serve as the basis for his theory of emotion which claims the thalamic region is the coordinating center for emotional reactions. First, after the removal of the cerebrum anterior to the thalamus in animal test subjects, the animals continue to display rage-like emotional responses. These reactions cease when the thalamus is then removed. Secondly, a tumor on one side of the thalamus can result in unilateral laughter or grimace under the appropriate conditions, although cortical and voluntary control of the same muscles is bilateral. Lastly, temporary impairment of cortical control of lower centers from light amnesia or permanent impairment by disease (e.g. tumor or lesion) can cause uncontrollable and prolonged weeping or laughing. Additional theories of emotion The location of the limbic system, the key brain area in the Papez-MacLean theory of emotion. The Cannon‚ÄìBard theory of emotion was formulated as a challenge and alternative to James‚ÄìLange theory. The Papez- Maclean theory is another influential theory of emotion that differs from the Cannon‚ÄìBard theory in terms of the area that is considered to be responsible for emotion expression. James Papez initially suggested that the interconnections among structures of the limbic system were ideally constituted to handle the long-lasting, intense aspects of experience that are typically associated with emotion. The circuit originally proposed by Papez consisted of the hippocampus, the ipsilateral mammillary body, the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, the cingulate cortex, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the entorhinal cortex, returning to the hippocampus. MacLean elaborated on Papez's earlier work, adding the prefrontal cortex, the septum, and the amygdala, and named this group of structures the limbic system. There is also the two-factor theory of emotion, as proposed by Stanley Schachter and Jerome E. Singer.

A familiar face on TV sitcoms and variety shows of the 1960s and 1970s, he appeared regularly on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Merv Griffin Show, The Dean Martin Show, The Mike Douglas Show, and The Joey Bishop Show. He had a natural gift for mimicry, and his impressions of celebrities such as Humphrey Bogart, Gary Cooper, Boris Karloff, and many others were considered among the best. However, he also could imitate a housefly on a slippery oil cloth, neon signs, alligators, driftwood furniture, rubber bands, frozen chickens, frogs, praying mantis, and ‚Äî his favorite ‚Äî an ostrich, all of which found their way into his act or in characters he played on TV. Early life He was born Mario Scarpa in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the youngest of 11 children born to Ermelindo and Adelina Scarpa, who had emigrated from Italy to America at the beginning of the 20th century. Ermelindo was a clarinetist with the RCA recording orchestra under the direction of Josef Pasternack, and went on to name all of his children after the characters in operas. Mario was named after the hero in La Tosca, an opera his mother admired while she was carrying him. Other siblings included Victoria, Yolanda, Gioconda, Mafalda, Alba, Melba, Thenistocles (Domisticles) and Aristides. Two additional older brothers died at ages 2 and 5 due to scarlet fever. In school he spent most of his time imitating his teachers and frustrating the principal. Marks enlisted in the US Army on December 12, 1940, and after serving two years, signed up for a six-year stint in the Merchant Marines. He sailed around the world, including stops in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Hong Kong. When he came back to the US, he did various odd jobs, including bus boy, drill press operator, and even selling flowers. He got into show business by pure accident, when some friends pushed him up onto the stage at Palumbo's in South Philadelphia, where he did impressions of W.C. Fields, Wendell Willkie and The Ink Spots. He found a partner and worked as a team under the name The Al Mar Brothers, but they soon fumbled and Marks was back doing more odd jobs. However, he found pickling hams, driving a cab and construction work‚Äîhis only other options‚Äîunfulfilling, so he decided to give New York a try. While in the Big Apple he rented a room with five other guys including fellow South Philadelphians Eddie Fisher, and Al Martino. He began working nightclubs in New York, Atlantic City and Chicago, and by the end of the 1950s Marks, Martino and Fisher were all winners on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. Career Marks made his first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on May 29, 1960. From that point on he appeared dozens of times throughout the 1960s and 1970s on popular variety shows. His big break came when he was cast as a regular on the 1962‚Äì63 season of The Joey Bishop Show. Marks appeared in the first 19 episodes of the show's second season as Freddy, manager to Bishop's character, when he was suddenly replaced. Newspapers at the time reported conflict between the show's star Bishop and his second banana Marks. Bishop denied it in the press, and many years later would go on to have Marks on his popular late-night talk show. Next, Marks would make a memorable appearance in an episode of Dick Van Dyke in 1963 when he played a love interest for Sally, played by Rose Marie. The episode, entitled \\"Jilting the Jilter\\", featured much of Marks' night-club routine at the time. Then in May 1964 he appeared on The Hollywood Palace to perform another of his famous night-club bits, entitled \\"How The West Was REALLY Won?\\". The skit featured Marks' flawless imitations of Humphrey Bogart, Gary Cooper, Robert Mitchum and a Native American Indian. In 1965 he guest-starred on two science-fiction programs, My Living Doll and My Favorite Martian. In the latter on an episode called \\"The Martian's Fair Hobo\\", Marks plays a hobo named Shorty Smith. The character allowed Marks to show off his talents for imitating animals and inanimate objects, such as foghorns and frogs. He was second banana again, in 1967, when he was featured as the American Indian \\"Pink Cloud\\" in the 1967 ABC comedy Western Rango, starring Tim Conway. Despite early favorable reviews, the show lasted only 17 episodes. In 1969 he appeared on an episode of the popular The Ghost & Mrs. Muir (TV Series) sitcom, playing a gangster who sounds a lot like Humphrey Bogart. He ended the decade with an appearance as a thief trying to hold up Lucille Ball on the Here's Lucy show. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Marks made frequent appearances on The Dean Martin Show, The Mike Douglas Show, The Joey Bishop Show; on The Merv Griffin Show alone he appeared a total of 15 times over nine years. During this time he also continued to work in night clubs all over the country and in Las Vegas, performing alongside Eddie Fisher, Ann-Margret, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Petula Clark. In a 1974 episode of The Odd Couple, he portrayed a late-night horror movie host named Igor, who sounded a lot like Boris Karloff. His only big- screen appearance was in the 1975 film Train Ride to Hollywood, where he was called upon again to imitate Humphrey Bogart. Also in 1975 Marks performed his famous \\"How The West Was REALLY Won?\\" routine on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast to Michael Landon. It was by far the hit of the show, and had host Martin and fellow roaster Don Rickles howling with laughter. In 1977 he starred alongside Billy Barty in a sitcom pilot called \\"Great Day\\". It told the story of a group of homeless who contemplate taking jobs to help save their soon-to-be-foreclosed mission. On an episode of Police Woman called \\"Blind Terror\\" that aired in 1978, Marks appeared along with Sandra Dee and the show's star, Angie Dickinson. In 1980 he lent his voice along with Rip Taylor to an animated short called Don't Miss the Boat. In 1981 he was working with Lucille Ball again, in the only project she ever directed, the unsold pilot for a sitcom called \\"Bungle Abbey\\". Marks' final role on TV was a featured one in the 1986‚Äì87 sitcom You Again? as Harry, a poker-playing friend to the show's star Jack Klugman. Music career Marks attracted international attention with the surprise novelty hit song \\"Loving You Has Made Me Bananas\\", which parodied the medleys and other popular music conventions of the big band era; the single first charted in April 1968. It was based on an old night-club routine of Marks, featuring an affected band singer of the radio era broadcasting from a remote Pennsylvania town. The song hit #19 on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart and #51 on the Hot 100. A re- release did similarly well in 1978, reaching #25 in the UK Singles Chart. The UK chart showing led to an appearance by Marks on Top of the Pops in May 1978. Two out of the three backing singers accidentally sang \\"Your father had the shopfitter blues\\", while the other one correctly sang \\"Your father had the shipfitter blues.\\"Top of the Pops 1978, BBC4 subtitling service Death Marks died on 28 November 1987, at the Atlantic City Medical Center Division in Pomona, NJ. At the time he was living in Brigantine, New Jersey. He was 64. Marks was married at least three times, once to Barbara Thomas (1952 to ?) then to a Kathleen(?) (1962‚Äì66) and again to Judy Marie De Salle (1971 to ?). One of these marriages produced a daughter. At the time of his death he was survived by two brothers and five sisters. Contributions in his name were offered to the American Cancer Society.

Germany, 1895. Hang gliding is an air sport employing a foot-launchable aircraft known as a hang glider. Typically, a modern hang glider is constructed of an aluminium alloy or composite-framed fabric wing. The pilot is ensconced in a harness suspended from the airframe, and exercises control by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame.  Overview  Early hang glider designs did not reliably achieve safe flight, their builders lacking a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles of flight. The first recorded controlled flights were by German engineer Otto Lilienthal, whose research, published in 1889, strongly influenced later designers.Flying-Machine, Otto Lilienthal's patent. Google.com. Retrieved November 29, 2011. The type of aircraft employed by Lilienthal is now referred to as a hang glider. Further hang glider research was undertaken during the 1920s in Europe, Australia and the US, where designers tested several wing concepts and the 'pendulum weight- shift control system'. In 1957 the American space agency NASA began testing various formats of a new wing called the Rogallo wing with the intent of possibly implementing the design as a recovery system for the Gemini space capsules. The wing's simplicity of design and ease of construction, in combination with its slow flight characteristics, did not go unnoticed by hang glider enthusiasts; Rogallo's flexible wing airfoil was soon adapted to the purpose of recreational flight, launching a hang glider renaissance.Low & Slow magazine produced by Joe Faust (1971) was the most powerful publicity tool during the early years. He followed Low & Slow with Hang Glider Weekly to reach 23 nations through 1981 with 216 editions. Joe's publications were written by a staff of scores of correspondents worldwide. A monthly publication, Ground Skimmer was started in May 1972 as a newsletter for club members in California. It soon grew to be a comprehensive magazine, recording the history of the hang gliding movement as it happened. By the end of 1973, the organization had become truly national in scope and in November 1976, the name of the magazine was changed to Hang Gliding. Glider Rider also appeared. In 2002, Hang Gliding and Paragliding magazines were combined and the resulting magazine was named Hang Gliding & Paragliding magazine. Early history By the end of the sixth century A.D., the Chinese had managed to build tethered kites large enough to sustain the weight of an average-sized man. George Cayley constructed a slope-launched glider that flew with a pilot in 1853. Starting in the 1880s, advancements were made in aerodynamics and construction that led to the first truly practical gliders; this information was often shared and published by early aviators and inventors, building a long series of incremental achievements. Through the 1880s, several aviation pioneers emerged in different countries around the world, and they all pursued glider designs with varying degrees of success. Chief among these were Otto Lilienthal in Berlin, Germany, Lawrence Hargrave in Sydney, New South Wales in Australia, Percy Pilcher in the United Kingdom, John Joseph Montgomery at Otay Mesa near San Diego, California (1880s) as well as at Santa Clara, California (1905) Octave Chanute and his team in Gary, Indiana, in the US, to name but a few. Otto Lilienthal duplicated some of his contemporaries' work and greatly expanded on it from 1874, publishing all of his research in 1889.The Flight of Birds as a Basis of Aviation. ; He also produced a series of gliders, and in 1891 was able to make controlled flights of or more routinely, as well as some soaring flights. He rigorously documented his work, influencing later designers; for this reason he is one of the best known and most influential of the early aviation pioneers. His type of aircraft is now known as a hang glider. By 1896, he had made about 2,000 flights of with a number of his designs when he crashed from a height of about , fracturing his spine. Percy Pilcher took a growing interest in aviation and built a glider called The Bat which he flew for the first time in 1895. Later that year Pilcher met and consulted with Otto Lilienthal, who was the leading expert in gliding; these discussions led to Pilcher building two more hang gliders, The Beetle and The Gull.Pilcher's gliders.

When World War 1 ended in 1918, the Treaty of Versailles practically ended engine-driven flights in Germany, thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers in the rest of the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural air flows in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. These activities on Wasserkuppe promoted a renaissance of gliding aviation. Many of these gliders flown in 1920 were hang gliders in that they were controlled by the pilot's weight shift alone. The first Wasserkuppe glider competition was held in 1920, and from 1924 they were organised by Rh√∂n-Rossitten Gesellschaft. Over the next decade, the contest grew in popularity. As many as 70 glider clubs from Europe sent their best gliders and pilots to compete for duration, altitude and distance prizes, the most coveted prize was that donated by President Paul von Hindenburg.

Video of his first flights in 1961 loaded in YouTube: and John Dickenson, who separately explored distinct airframes and control systems to be adapted to a Rogallo wing and be flown as a hang glider. On August 1961, American engineer Barry Palmer developed and flew the first foot-launched Rogallo-wing hang glider.Several Langley employees shared Rogallo's enthusiasm for the innovative flight technology and even conducted manned flexible wing flight research during weekends on the Outer Banks with privately owned equipment. Although qualitative in nature, these investigations proved \\"valuable in providing quick answers and indicating promising directions for the much more costly and time consuming instrumented but unmanned NASA flight research.\\" This took place near Latrobe, east of Sacramento, California. Palmer used aluminium tubing and no wires for construction, fearing kinking during assembly. Most flights were performed with just a set of inclined parallel bars that split his weight between his underarms and hands. The last of Palmer's foot-launched hang gliders flew in the summer of 1962 and it had a ski-lift type of seat mounted to the keel with a universal joint for pendulum weight-shift control. During the period from 1961 to 1963 Barry Palmer made tens of flights using this concept. His longest flight ranged in length up to , at altitudes up to , and had an overall glide ratio of 4.5 to 1. Palmer's wing was heavy by today's standards and was not particularly portable. Palmer relates that he had a good aerospace job and was flying for fun. He did not attempt to modernize or market the flexible-wing hang glider and shared all details with anybody interested.Interview with Gerard Farell on January 23, 2007 ‚Äì January 24, 2007.Palmer moved on to invent the first ultralight trike: The Paraplane, registered by the FAA on April 24, 1967, as the Palmer Parawing D-6, serial 1A, N7144.

In April 1963 Mike Burns first flew the Skiplane, a flexible wing glider on pontoons.Sky Sports, pgs 39‚Äì42, 1989 edition In September 1963, Australian inventor John Dickenson set out to build a water ski wing that could be released at altitude and glide to a safe landing. After seeing a Rogalo airfoil gliding parachuteInterview video with John Dickenson. YouTube in a magazine, Dickenson designed the ski kite he called the Ski Wing. Dickenson fashioned an airframe that incorporated a triangle control frame and utilized wire bracing to distribute the load to the Rogallo airfoil; the pilot sat on a swinging seat.Western Museum of Flight The weight-shift (swinging seat) and control frame are two key control concepts J. Dickenson 'imported' from water ski kites into his Ski Wing. Dickenson's Ski Wing was stable and controllable, unlike the flat manned kites used at water ski shows at the time.Stability and weight-shift control are inherent flex-wing characteristics previously established and described by its inventor F. Rogallo and by NASA engineers in the Paresev and Fleep programs. The Ski Wing was first flown in public at the Grafton Jacaranda Festival, in Grafton, New South Wales, in September 1963 by Rod Fuller while towed behind a motorboat. The Ski Wing was light and portable so Dickenson decided to file for a patent; however, lacking resources, Dickenson procured a provisional patent ‚Äì which would later lapse.On October/11/1963 Dickenson filed for a patent, and a provisional protection was awarded for his application number 36189/63 but the patent was not finally awarded: By 1972, Australian builders Bill Bennett and Bill Moyes further developed the Dickenson format of water ski kite into a foot-launched hang glider.Patent filed by Bill Bennett on September 24, 1969: U.S. Pat.

Rigid-wing hang gliders Flight Design Exxtacy rigid wing glider, showing flaps and spoilerons, flares for a smooth landing; 2001. There have been several rigid- wing hang gliders flown since Otto Lilienthal took his first flights in the 1890s. The first two high-performing modern hang gliders, however, were the Mitchell Wing and the Icarus. In 1908, a gliding club in Breslau had the pilot hung behind a cable-stayed triangle control frame for weight-shift control. Hang gliders with similar control were also built by Percy Pilcher, Augustus Herring, John J. Montgomery, Gottlob Espenlaub, Charles Richards, Barry Hill Palmer, George Spratt, Mike Burns, and John Dickenson. In the early 1940s Don Mitchell, an aeronautical engineer, first became involved with flying wing glider design and construction. WWII interrupted his research until 1974, with the advent of hang glider mania; adventurers were experimenting with design and exploring records worldwide. It was then that Mitchell's flying wing resurfaced. Dr. Howard Long took an interest and asked Don Mitchell to make him a refined 'flying wing' hang glider. The result was the foot-launched Mitchell Wing. When the foot-launched Mitchell Wing B-10 flew in the 1977 US Nationals, the hang gliding world was completely astounded. The Mitchell Wing then went on to set and hold every world record in its class. In 1980, George Worthington soared to high and glided , setting two new rigid wing records.

Rick Poynter and Murray Sargeson introduce hang gliding to New Zealand at the 'Fly a Kite Day' in Auckland. The New Zealand Hang Gliding Association is formed as a result of this. Now thousands around the world were interested in hang gliding. However, proper flight schools and uniform training guidelines did not exist. One learned the flying predominantly autodidactic. As late as autumn 1973, Mike Harker and fellow American Walt Nielsen founded the world's first alpine hang- gliding school in Scuol in the Engadine Valley, Switzerland. They taught on the ski slopes sitting on a swing seat and skiing down the slopes to gain speed and lift off. They trained many of the first kite flying pioneers who later founded their own flying schools. Almost everywhere in the world in 1974, kite makers began series production of Rogallo gliders. The first- generation hang gliders initially had less than 80 degrees nose angle and a sink rate of over 4 m / sec. These aircraft were, however, like the Australian and American role models, still unexplored and very dangerous. Flutter and spiral dives as well as mechanical breaks were the most frequent causes of accidents, which often resulted in death. The second generation in the kite construction ushered the American Roy Haggard in the spring of 1975 with his sensational \\"Dragonfly\\" one. He brought with the Dragonfly most of the improvements that ever existed in an aircraft in the kite history. From March 12 to 23, 1975, Austrian Sepp Himberger organized the first unofficial World Championship in K√∂ssen / Tyrol. His invitation was followed by 300 hang glider pilots from all over the world who demonstrated their skills in 3-7 minute flights.

The Mahra Sultanate, known in its later years as the Mahra State of Qishn and Socotra ( ') or sometimes the Mahra Sultanate of Ghayda and Socotra ( ') was a sultanate that included the historical region of Mahra and the Guardafui Channel island of Socotra in what is now eastern Yemen. It was ruled by the Banu Afrar dynasty for most of its history. In 1886, the Sultanate became a British protectorate and later joined the Aden Protectorate. The Sultanate was abolished in 1967 upon the founding of the People's Republic of South Yemen and is now part of the Republic of Yemen.Paul Dresch. A History of Modern Yemen. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000 The Sultanate was inhabited by the Mahri people who spoke the Mahri language, a modern South Arabian language. The Mehri share, with their regional neighbours on the island of Socotra and in Dhofar in Oman, blood lineage ties in Somalia with the Darood tribe, cultural traditions like a modern South Arabian language, Arabic incursions, and frankincense agriculture. The region benefits from a coastal climate, distinct from the surrounding desert climate, with seasons dominated by the khareef or monsoon. In 1967, with the departure of the British from the larger southern Arabian region, the Aden-based South Yemeni government divided the Mahra region, creating the Al Mahra Governorate. Socotra was administered by the Aden Governorate until 2004, when it was placed under the Hadhramaut Governorate. Ancient history The ancient history of the Mahra region begins with the formation of the  øƒÄd kingdom by an Arab tribe called  øƒÄd which settled in South Arabia. The Mehri people are traditionally considered descendants of the  øƒÄd Kingdom and blood relatives of the Thamud. According to Islamic genealogies, the forefather of the Mehri people was Ya'rub, the son of Qahtan, grandson of the Prophet Hud, and ancestor of the Himyarite, Qataban and Sabaean kingdoms. Ya'rub (or, by alternate accounts, Ya'rub's son), is sometimes credited with the invention of the Arabic language. During ancient times, the  øƒÄd Kingdom was a transshipment point for the frankincense trade. It was exported mostly to ancient Europe. It has been suggested the  øƒÄd Kingdom, and the current location of Mahra Sultanate, were the first places in the world where the camel was domesticated. Islamic period During the first decade of the Islamic calendar (the 620s in the Gregorian calendar), a large delegation from Mahra under the leadership of Mehri bin Abyad went to Medina to meet the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and during that meeting the entire Mehri tribe decided to embrace Islam. Before embracing Islam, the tribe was polytheist and worshiped multiple deities. After the meeting in Medina, Muhammad issued an injunction, stating that the members of the Mehri tribe are true Muslims and no war should be waged against them, and that any violator of the injunction shall be considered to be waging war against Allah. The entire Mehri tribe became some of the earliest adopters of Islam. Their action had an added bonus as becoming Muslims secured them a political alliance and stable relations with the Muslim leadership in Medina. Prior to embracing Islam, Al- Mahra was a vassal state of the Persian Empire and had been subjected to Persian control for many years. Siding with Medina enabled the Mehri people to break away from Persian control and regain their liberty. =Ridda Wars= When Muhammad died in the year 632 CE, many Arab tribes, including the Mehri, interpreted his death as the end of Islam, and they abandoned the religion by either reverting to paganism or following certain individuals who claimed prophethood. In 634 CE, the Mehri and other tribes rebelled against Caliph Abu Bakar who became the new leader of the Muslims. In response, he launched a new military campaign against the rebels. There were not many records about the power structure within the Mehris, however, during the Ridda Wars information regarding the intra-tribal affair was revealed by al-Tabari. According to al- Tabari, before the death of Prophet Muhammad, there was an intra-tribal rivalry within the Mehri tribe, which consisted of two competing factions: the Bani Shakhrah faction and their larger rival, the Bani Muharib. The Bani Muharib, who hailed from Al-Mahra's mountain regions, had the upper hand against their smaller rival. A Muslim army under the command of Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl was sent to Al-Mahra to face the Mehri who had turned their back on Islam like many Arab tribes. The Muslim army was too weak to confront the Mehri tribe in battle, and this situation forced Ikrimah to engage in political activity rather than initiating war in Mahra. Ikrimah met with the leadership of the Bani Muharib faction and convinced them to return to Islam. After this event, the army under Ikrimah's command, and the Bani Muharib faction, formed a military alliance against the Bani Shakhrah. The Ridda War in Al-Mahra ended quickly as the newly formed alliance subdued the Bani Shakhrah faction without bloodshed. Islam was once again the only religion in Al-Mahra. = The military legacy of al-Mahra = The people of al-Mahra played a role in the history of Islam and the Arab world's military achievements during the early years of Islam. The Mehri army participated in the conquest of North Africa and Spain. The Mehri tribe's achievements have been well-documented by historian Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam in his book titled The History of the Conquests of Egypt and North Africa and Spain. At the beginning of the Muslim conquest of North Africa, the Al-Mahri tribe mostly contributed cavalry to the army. They played a crucial role in the Arab Muslim army under the command of 'Amr ibn al-'As, who was a well-known Arab military commander and one of the Sahaba (\\"Companions\\"). The Al-Mahri army fought alongside him during the Muslim conquest of North Africa, which began with the defeat of the Byzantine imperial forces at the Battle of Heliopolis, and later at the Battle of Nikiou in Egypt in the year 646. The army was a highly skilled cavalry which rode horses and a special camel breed called the Mehri originating from Al-Mahra, and renowned for its speed, agility and toughness. The Al-Mahra contingent spearheaded the army during the conquest of the city of Alexandria. The Al-Mahra army was nicknamed \\"the people who kill without being killed\\" by 'Amr ibn al-'As. Commander 'Amr ibn al-'As was amazed by army's ruthlessly efficient warfare while sustaining minimal casualties. As a result of Al- Mahri's success in the Muslim conquest of Egypt, its commander named Abd al- sallam ibn Habira al-Mahri was promoted and he was ordered by 'Amr ibn al-'As to lead the entire Muslim army during the conquest of Libya, which at the time was a Byzantine territory. The army under the command Abd al-sallam ibn Habira al-Mahri defeated the Byzantine imperial army, and the campaign which brought a permanent end to Byzantine rule of Libya. After the Muslim conquest of Egypt, Abd al-sallam ibn Habira al-Mahri was once again promoted as a result of his success as a temporary commander of the entire Muslim army, and he was appointed the first Muslim leader of Libya. During the Second Fitna, more than 600 soldiers carrying the Al-Mahra flag were sent to North Africa to fight the Byzantines and Berbers. Several centuries later, another Mehri man called Abu Bekr Mohammed Ibn Ammar Al-Mahri Ash-shilbi, who was a politician from modern day Silves, Portugal, became a prime minister of the Taifa of Seville in Islamic Iberia, and served King Al-mu‚Äôatamed Ibn Abbad who was member of Muslim Dynasties of Spain. Abu Bekr was highly competent as prime minister, but later he crowned himself king and led a failed rebellion against the Mohammedan Dynasties of Spain. In year 1084, Abu Bekr Mohammed Ibn Ammar Al- Mahri Ash-shilbi was caught and executed by the forces of the Kingdom of Seville. Throughout the Muslim conquest of North Africa the army from Al-Mahra was awarded lands in most of the newly conquered territories. Initially the Mehri tribe was given the region of Jabal Yashkar by the Muslim leadership. This region was located east of the town of Al-Askar which at that time was the capital of Egypt. After the end of Muslim conquest of Egypt in year 641, the Muslim commander 'Amr ibn al-'As established the town of Fustat which became the new capital of Egypt. The army was given additional land in the new capital which then became known as Khittat Mahra or the Mahra quarter in English. This land was used by the Mahra forces as a garrison. The Mahra quarter was named after the residents from Al-Mahra as they were the sole owners of the land. Other Arab tribes which were part of the Muslim conquest of Egypt had to share lands. This is the reason why their lands bore a non- tribal name. The Mahra tribe also shared the al-Raya quarter in Fustat with various tribes who were closely associated with the Prophet Muhammad and, according to historical accounts, the Mahra forces used the al-Raya quarter as a residence and stable for their horses. The Mahra quarter was located close to the Al-Raya quarter was which the absolute centre of the new capital of Fustat.  Mahra Sultanate  After the erosion of Abbasid authority in Yemen, the tribes of al-Mahra had grown distant from Arabic rule. The Ayyubids of Egypt held loose authority over the region, followed by the Rasulids of western Yemen. = Sultanate of Shihr = In 1432, the Ba Dujana family took control of the important coastal city of Shihr from the Rasulids, and then successfully repelled a Rasulid counterattack. In 1445, the Ba Dujana defended against an attack by the newly-formed Kathiri state, securing their borders. The independent sultanate at Shihr was the first premodern state in Mahri lands. Following the collapse of the Rasulid dynasty and the rise of the Tahirids, a number of former dignitaries from Aden came to Shihr as refugees, and told the reigning sultan, Muhammad bin Sa'd, that Aden was ripe for conquest. In 1456, Muhammad bin Sa'd launched a naval invasion of Aden with nine ships; however, much of the fleet was broken up in a storm and bin Sa'd was captured by the Tahirids. In retaliation, the Tahirid sultan sent an army commanded by Zayn al-Sunbuli to occupy Shihr. The campaign was only half- successful, and parts of the area were still held by the Ba Dujana. Determined to break the stalemate, Sultan Malik Amir bin Tahir led a great expedition across the desert coast from Aden to Mahra. Vastly outnumbered, the Ba Dujana retreated from Shihr ahead of the Tahirid advance. The Tahirids plundered the city and installed a governor who was loyal to their interests. The city of Shihr was once more brought under the control of the Ba Dujana clan in 1478, when it was taken by their young leader, Sa'd bin Faris. Around 1480, the Mahri settled the island of Socotra and used it as a strategic base against their rivals in Hadhramaut. During this time, al-Mahra had been in a near- constant state of war with the Kathiri, who were trying to take control of Shihr. In 1488, the Ba Dujana enlisted the help of their Socotran allies to push the Kathiri out of Shihr once more. = Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra = Yet the dominance of the Ba Dujana clan would last only for another seven years. In 1495, bouts of infighting between the tribes of Mahra escalated into civil war. The Kathiri sultan, Jafar bin 'Amr, took advantage of the situation to support the Zwedi faction, ensuring the downfall of the Ba Dujana hegemony. After a disastrous defeat at Tabala, on the outskirts of Shihr, the Ba Dujana permanently lost control of the city and were isolated in the interior. They were replaced by the Zwedi and Afrari families of Qishn and Socotra, who, in sacrificing Shihr to the Kathiri state, managed to solidify the core Mahra domain as it would remain, more or less, until the present day.  Arrival of the Portuguese  In 1507, a Portuguese fleet commanded by Trist√£o da Cunha and Alfonso de Albuquerque landed on Socotra and, after a bloody battle, seized the main fortress at Suq. Socotra would remain in Portuguese hands until 1511, and was abandoned by the Portuguese due to its poor strategic importance to control de Red Sea. In 1545, the Kathiri sultan Badr bin Tuwayriq amassed an army and, with support from the Ottoman Turks, conquered Qishn. The Portuguese, who were competing with the Ottomans for control of trade routes in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, bombarded Qishn and returned it to the Mahris. British protectorate The Sultan of Qishn (in a turban), late 1930s In 1862, the Mahra Sultanate signed a protectorate treaty with Great Britain after negotiating with the British government, and later Al- Mahra state became part of the Aden Protectorate. The Aden Protectorate was the British government's effort to secure the trade route to British India. Bringing the area under British control protected a strategically important naval route against the Ottoman Empire. The main point of the treaty was that the rulers retained jurisdiction over their land, and in exchange for British protection, the Al-Mahra sultanate agreed not to enter agreements with, or cede territory to, any other foreign government. Since 1866 the Aden Protectorate meant that nine regions along the Gulf of Aden became vassal states of Great Britain. In the 1940s Al-Mahra and its neighbouring regions along the Gulf were forced to sign Advisory Treaties, and those who refused were subjected to deadly airstrikes delivered by the British Royal Air force. The Advisory Treaty meant that the local leadership no longer had jurisdiction over their internal affairs, and the treaty gave the British government complete control over the nation's internal affairs and the order of succession. The Advisory Treaties caused resentment against British rule and the spread of Arab Nationalism in Al-Mahra and the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. =The end of the Mahra Sultanate= During the 1960s the British sustained losses against various Egypt-sponsored guerrilla forces and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY). In 1963 the British government declared a state of emergency in the Aden Protectorate, and by 1967 the British forces had left Yemen as a result of losses against the National Liberation Front (Yemen) which later seized power in Al-Mahra. In 1967, the Al-Mahra sultanate was absorbed by the Marxist People's Republic of South Yemen which itself was an entity heavily sponsored by the Soviets. They put an end to the centuries-old Al-Mahri sultanate. Sultan Issa Bin Ali Al-Afrar Al- Mahri was the last reigning Al-Mahri Sultan of Qishn and Socotra. The sultanate was abolished in 1967 and was annexed by Soviet supported South Yemen, which itself later united with North Yemen to become unified Yemen in 1990. In 2014 the land which was formerly known as the Mahra Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra was absorbed into a new region called Hadramaut, and this reform has angered many in Al-Mahra who now believe that the Yemeni government is further centralizing its grip on power. Rulers The Sultans of Mahra had the title of Sultan al-Dawla al-Mahriyya (Sultan Qishn wa Suqutra).States of the Aden Protectorates Their descendants are active politicians nowadays. =Sultans= *c.1750 - 1780: \`Afrar al-Mahri *c.1780 - 1800: Taw\`ari ibn \`Afrar al-Mahri *c.1800 - 1820: Sa\`d ibn Taw\`ari Ibn \`Afrar al-Mahri *c.1834: Sultan ibn \`Amr (on Suqutra) *c.1834: Ahmad ibn Sultan (at Qishn) *1835 - 1845: \`Amr ibn Sa\`d ibn Taw\`ari Afrar al-Mahri *1845 - 18..

During the conquests the cavalry unit from Al- Mahra introduced the Mehri camel to northern Africa, and now it is found throughout the area. It is better known as the Mehari camel in most of northern Africa, and is sometimes also known as the Sahel camel. It is a special breed originating in Al-Mahra. They are renowned for their speed, agility and toughness. They have a large but slender physique, and because of its small hump it is perfectly suited for ridding. During the colonial period in northern Africa, the French government took advantage of the Mehri camel's proven military capabilities, and established a camel corps called the M√©hariste which was part of the Arm√©e d'Afrique. It patrolled the Sahara using the Mehri camel. The French M√©hariste camel corps was part of the Compagnies Sahariennes the French Army of the Levant. In 1968, France's car maker Citro√´n introduced the Citro√´n M√©hari, which was a light off-road vehicle named after the famous Mehri camel. The Citro√´n M√©hari was a variant of the Citro√´n 2CV, and Citro√´n built more than 144,000 M√©hari between 1968 and 1988. A new, 2016 electric model called the Citro√´n E-M√©hari is now being sold in Europe; it is a compact SUV like the M√©hari.

The most known version occurs in Bangkok, Thailand as well as other cities in the country. It is one of the most pervasive scams in Thailand. Most of the shops are gold or jewelry shops. The marks tend to be tourists from outside Thailand. It has been alleged that this scam has been operating for the past 20 years, sometimes in the same premises. It has been suggested that individuals in the Royal Thai Police and even politicians protect this scam. The scam was demonstrated on an episode of the BBC series The Real Hustle and in a Scam City episode in Bangkok. Also in other countries such as Turkey and Sri Lanka, the trick is performed in various versions Oplichters in het buitenland (in Dutch), episodes S4E5 and S5E6. The scam A network of touts and con men present the mark with an opportunity to profit from buying discount gems from a jewelry shop. The mark is convinced that he can buy gems at duty-free price and bring them overseas for a threefold or more profit. Through a network of helpers, each of whom tells the mark bits of information, the mark is guided to the jewelry shop. #A tout will be on the lookout at popular tourist spots like the Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Khaosan Road, Siam Square, or other temples or tourist attractions in Bangkok. (Also, the scam may often be initiated by a tuk-tuk driver.) The tout will be dressed as a student or gentleman and will approach the mark to tell him the place he is about to visit is closed today because of some made-up holiday. The tout, taking advantage of the Thai people's reputation for friendliness, may strike up a conversation, asking where the mark is from, and if this is his first time in Bangkok. The tout will also tell the mark that a certain tuk-tuk waiting nearby is cheap or even free because it has been sponsored by the tourism ministry and can bring him to other temples elsewhere to visit. Sometimes this gentleman finds out which country the mark is from and informs the con man at the next layer about it. #If the mark gets on the tuk-tuk, the driver will bring him to a secluded temple in the city, drop him off, and wait for him to return. #When the mark walks into the temple, there will be a gentleman praying inside. That person will tell him about a scheme by the government which allows people to buy jewelry duty-free and make a profit when the gems are shipped to their home country, adding that today is the last day of this scheme. # The tuk-tuk may take the mark to another temple, where another person (sometimes a Thai, sometimes a Westerner) tells the same story, building up the mark's confidence through a seemingly \\"independent\\" verification. If the mark is interested, the person will tell the tuk-tuk driver to take him to the jewelry store. #At the shop the mark will be pressured to buy jewelry. If the mark purchases the jewelry, the gem will be packaged and shipped directly to the mark's address in his home country so that he will not have a chance to get the gem appraised or return it for a refund. In the purchase process the mark may be told to go to a nearby gold shop to purchase gold to be exchanged for the gem - this money laundering ensures that any stop-payment on the part of the mark will not affect the gem store's profits. #The mark returns to his home country, only to find the jewelry to be worth far less than he paid for it (often due to inferior quality of the stones or gold). Other scams include fake Thai Mikimoto certificates. Once in a store, a variety of selling tactics are employed, including bait and switch, and \\"educating\\" gemstone novices about \\"fake gems\\" which are in fact real, and selling them \\"real gems\\" which are in fact fake. Variants in other countries Gem and jewel scams take place in other countries as well. In the Turkish tourist town Antalya, the tourists are ensnared by an organised trip to a tourist attraction such as a waterfall, after which the tourists are transported to a state-licensed jewelry store. Here the jewelry sold is of regular quality, but overpriced due to large commissions charged on them. In Sri Lanka the jewelry scam takes place more or less in a similar way like in Thailand. Also, a similar scam takes place with old Dutch VOC-coins, supposedly from ship wrecks, which are sold to tourists. The sellers mix low-value real coins with high-value fake coins and sell them for high prices.Oplichters in het buitenland (in Dutch), episodes S4E5 and S5E6  See also  * Thai tailor scam * Thai zig zag scam *Crime in Thailand References Category:Confidence tricks Category:Fraud in Thailand Category:Tourism in Thailand ","title":"Gem scam"},{"id":"3604468","text":"Al Mahwit ( Al-Ma·∏•wƒ´t) is the capital city of Al Mahwit Governorate, Yemen.

It is located in the inland south of the country with Ta'izz Governorate to the southwest, Ad Dali' Governorate to the southeast, Dhamar Governorate to the north, and short borders with Al Bayda' Governorate to the east and Al Hudaydah Governorate to the west. It has an area of 5,344 km¬≤ and a population estimated at around 1,665,000 in 2004, making it the most densely populated governorate in Yemen outside of San'a city. Its capital is Ibb, which, along with Jibla, are extremely significant historic cities. The province contains many attractions in districts such as Yareem, Ba'dan and Al-Sabrah. Ibb is located on the southwestern side of the escarpment of the Yemen Highlands, with dramatic drops to Ta'izz city and the Tihama coastline. There are also impressive views of 3,070 metre high Jabal Sabir to the south. Countryside in Ibb Governorate Owing to the way in which it captures the upper-level southwestern monsoonal flow during the months from April to October, Ibb governorate is the wettest place in Arabia. Though meteorological data are exceedingly poor and even of questionable accuracy, the annual precipitation is probably more than 1,000 mm (40 inches) and some estimate suggest it could be as high as 1,500mm (60 inches). There is little rain from November to February, but for the rest of the year there is probably at least 100mm (4 inches) of rain per month. Temperatures are warm, averaging about 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F) in the day but nights are quite cool. Because of its abundant rainfall, Ibb is known as \\"the fertile province\\". Almost the whole area of the governorate outside urban centres is cultivated despite the steep terrain, and the number of crops produced is extraordinarily large for so small an area. Qat is particularly important, but wheat, barley, sesame and sorghum are the major sources of food for most people outside Ibb city. Sophisticated systems for management and storage of water from the seasonal rains allows extra crops to be grown during the dry season. This sophisticated agriculture allows Ibb to support an extremely dense rural population, with densities of up to 500 people/km¬≤ being normal in the wettest areas. In recent years, Ibb governorate has been the scene of numerous sit-ins in protest at government policies: many of the most significant anti-government protesters since 1999 have been natives of Ibb and surrounding areas.

It was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Saba æ (), which some scholars believe to be the ancient Sheba of biblical fame. It is located approximately east of Yemen's modern capital, Sana'a, and is in the region of the Sarawat Mountains. It has a current population of 16,794. History =Ancient= The Barran Temple, a relic of the Sabaean era Standing female figure wearing a strap and a necklace, 3rd‚Äì2nd millennium BC, made of sandstone and quartzite, height: 27.5 cm, width: 14.3 cm, depth: 14.3 cm, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) The Sabaean kingdom was based around Ma'rib, with territory in northern Yemen. The Sabaean kings made their capital at Ma'rib, and built great irrigation works such as the Ma'rib Dam, whose ruins are still visible. The Marib Dam supported a flourishing culture for more than a thousand years. They also built castles and temples in the area, notably Awwam and Barran, respectively. Saba was known for dealing in the lucrative frankincense and myrrhAge of Faith, p. 156 trade. They were a seafaring people and were known to have influence and a population in the Northeast African kingdom of D ømt, across the Red Sea in Eritrea and Abyssinia, the only other source of both frankincense and myrrh. In 25 BC, Aelius Gallus of Rome led an expedition to Ma'rib, laying siege to the city. He suffered major losses and was forced to retreat to Egypt.Chris Scarre, The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Rome (London: Penguin Books, 1995), 9 (also Augustus' Res Getae 26) The site of ancient Ma'rib was largely abandoned during the 20th century. Although a small village remains, the multi-story mud-brick buildings of the historic city are largely in ruins. The modern city of Ma'rib is located about north of the center of the ancient city. =20th century= In 1982, floods ravaged the country. In response, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates financed the construction of the current dam of Ma'rib in 1984. The Shaikh himself was reportedly descended from people who migrated from the area of Ma'rib to what is now the UAE. =Yemeni Civil War= During the Yemeni Civil War (2015‚Äìpresent), Ma'rib and the surrounding Ma'rib Governorate came under attack by the Houthis movement rebelling against the government of Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. The tribes of Ma'rib repelled the Houthis with help from the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. According to the Abu Dhabi-based The National newspaper, \\"With 80 per cent of the province's population Sunni and only one of the five main tribes supportive of the Zaidi Shiite Houthis, tribal fighters managed to repel the attack. As a result, the Houthis control only about 20 per cent of Marib and the oil fields remained under Hadi's control. Many of the tribes in Marib, and in neighbouring al-Jawf and Shabwa provinces, are loyal to Al-Islah Party. According to two tribal chiefs, there are 8,000 Yemeni forces and tribal fighters based in Ma'rib united against the Houthis. Some are directly loyal to President Hadi, others to Saudi Arabia, and a large number to the al- Islah Party, an Islamist group. The entire First Armoured Brigade, considered a military wing of al-Islah, based in Sanaa, was transferred to Ma'rib in 2014 to defend the province. Other sections of Yemen's military remained loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former president overthrown by Arab Spring protests who has now sided with the Houthis against Hadi. After the Saudi-led coalition joined the war in March 2015 and drove the Houthis from most of Yemen's southern provinces in July 2015, the focus shifted to Marib, known as the gateway to Sana'a, where the strong support base made it a natural location for an attack in the north. According to Al-Jazeera, by 7 April 2015, Houthi forces had been expelled from the majority of Ma'rib Governorate by Saudi- backed tribesmen. The governor of Marib told Al-Jazeera that forces allied to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Gulf coalition were \\"perusing the last pockets of Houthis\\" in the province. The city of Marib is just from the capital, and the province adjoins the predominantly Sunni provinces of Al Jawf, Al-Baitha and Shabwa, where the Houthis' control is unlikely to hold if attacked. In particular, Al-Jawf to the north would provide a route towards the Houthi's Saada stronghold. The coalition began moving supplies to Marib in March 2015, using land routes from Saudi Arabia through Hadramout and Shabwa provinces. On August 2015, coalition forces started flying more reinforcements to Marib using a small airport in the tiny town of Safer, 60 km east of Marib city. Loyalist military sources said further reinforcements including tanks, armoured vehicles, rocket launchers and Apache helicopters arrived August 2015. The town serves as a base for the state-run Safer Exploration and Production Operations Company and other foreign companies working in Yemen's vital energy sector. The main gas pipeline south also runs through the town, which is controlled by the pro-Hadi military commander Abdullah Al-Shaddadi. The nearest Houthi presence was in Baihan in Shabwa province, away.\\" On 4 September 2015, 52 Emirati, 10 Saudi, 5 Bahrani servicemen of the Arab coalition and scores of pro-Hadi Yemeni soldiers were killed by a Houthi ballistic missile attack against a military base in Safer, Ma'rib. Three months later, another ballistic missile strike claimed the lives of 23 Saudi, 16-18 Sudanese, 9 Moroccan, and 7 Emirati soldiers including two senior commanders of the Saudi-led coalition along with at least 40 American PMCs as claimed by the Houthis on the Safer base near Ma'rib on December 14. More than 100 Yemeni government soldiers were killed in a drone and missile attack on a military camp near Ma'rib on 18 January 2020, leaving over a hundred more soldiers injured and killing at least 5 civilians. The Houthis were suspected and accused of carrying out the attack, although they denied responsibility. Five foreign mine clearance experts were killed in an explosion inside the Saudi Project for Landmine Clearance MASAM on January 20, 2019. One of the experts was a resident of South Africa of British descent. Other members of the team were from Colombia and unspecified countries in Africa. On 27 May 2020, a Houthi missile attack targeted the headquarters of the army command of the Saudi-backed government in Marib province killing 8 soldiers including the son and nephew of the Chief of Staff of Republic of Yemen Armed Forces, Lt. Gen. Sagheer bin Aziz. Oil refinery The Yemen Oil Refining Company opened a refinery in Ma'rib in 1986, which produces of oil per day (2009).

Originally an improvement on the 1906 A class, 141 were built between 1915 and 1927 by NZR's Addington Workshops, A & G Price Limited of Thames, New Zealand, and North British Locomotive Company, making the AB class the largest class of steam locomotives ever to run in New Zealand. An additional eleven were rebuilt from the tank version of the AB ‚Äì the WAB class ‚Äì between 1947 and 1957. Two North British-made locomotives were lost in the wreck of the SS Wiltshire in May 1922.  Construction and design  The genesis of the AB class originated from the construction of A class 4-6-2 No. 409 at Addington Railway Workshops in 1906. A two-cylinder simple-expansion locomotive, 409 was initially classified AB to differentiate it from the four-cylinder compound A and AD class locomotives, which were by and large of a similar design although built as compounds. AB 409 was, in reality, the experimental locomotive for what would become the most prolific type on the New Zealand Railways network, with construction beginning on a new prototype 4-6-2 in 1915. The new locomotive, AB 608, was to a completely different design from AB 409 when it emerged from the Addington Workshops in 1915. Although largely similar to the A class, it had a new design of cab and boiler, which was fitted with a superheater after trials conducted on AB 409\\\\. It also had the distinctive Vanderbilt tender, which would become a hallmark of the AB class during its working life. This locomotive was to become the first of 141 similar locomotives built by various builders in New Zealand and the United Kingdom for NZR.  Introduction  The AB class compared more favourably in service against the compound A class. Reputedly the first engine able to generate one horsepower for every 100 pounds of weight (16.4 W/kg), the AB class was efficient and versatile, and the engines were easy to maintain and operate. However, it became clear that there were several shortcomings of the design ‚Äì notably the cab was too small, and the tenders were not sturdy enough. A new and longer cab was fitted to all new locomotives being built from that time onwards, with the first appearing on AB 663\\\\. New tender structures were also built at a later date. The locomotives were extremely versatile, and the AB class were used on almost every section of the NZR network, the exception being the Nelson Section (closed 1955). In later years, the class were displaced from their mainline duties first by the larger J and K series locomotives, and later by the arrival of diesel locomotives (DA and DG classes in the North Island,DH and DJ classes in the South Island). As a result of the arrival of new diesel locomotives in the North Island from 1955 onwards, many of the North Island-based locomotives were transferred to the South Island to see out their remaining working lives. The final duties of the AB class were on branch line workings, where they found their niche after being displaced from most mainline duties by larger locomotives. These in turn displaced the A and Q class 4-6-2 locomotives from their duties, resulting in the withdrawal of all Q class locomotives by 1957 and a reduction in the number of A class locomotives. The locomotives also worked some lesser mainline duties, and others, such as those at Gisborne, were used as bankers to assist trains heading south to Napier. Being highly capable, the AB class were used for both freight and passenger trains. The AB class was easily able to pull an express passenger train at speeds of , or haul 700-tonne goods trains on easy grades. Along with the earlier F class, they were known as the \\"Maids for all work\\". Their work on express passenger trains was diminished by the arrival of the J class of 1939, and K class of 1932 tender locomotives in the 1930s, and also with the introduction of the heavier steel-panelled carriages built from 1930 until 1943. Despite being displaced, the AB class could still be found at work on relief expresses during holiday periods. The locomotives did not change greatly during their NZR career. The first change was to fit Waikato-type spark arrestors to many of the North Island-based engines, resulting in a new 'pear-shaped' smokebox with an ash hopper at the base of the smokebox. The cast-iron smokebox doors were replaced by steel ones, and the brake pump was moved from its original location on the right-hand side of the smokebox to a new position, recessed into the running board, just forward of the cab on the same side. Another notable change was that many of the class were fitted with ballast blocks for mechanical purposes. As the locomotives rode well, this was not to prevent derailments as with the Q class 4-6-2s of 1901. Furthermore, certain engines were not fitted with ballast blocks, so their inclusion is questionable. Other cosmetic changes included fitting a large Pyle National electric headlight on top of the smokebox and replacement of the copper-capped funnels with the standard NZR \\"flowerpot\\" type. Components =Boilers= The AB type boiler had a working pressure of 180psi, a standard across the type. These boilers were of standard construction, no matter which firm built them, and as such were interchangeable across any locomotives of the type. They were also similar to the boilers built for the WAB and WS class 4-6-4T tank locomotives in 1939 - in fact, the WAB boiler and AB boilers were the same, with those fitted to the WAB fitted with the necessary components to draw water from the locomotive's side tanks. This type of boiler was also adapted for use on the Q and AA class 4-6-2 tender locomotives of 1901 and 1915 respectively when their original boilers wore out. In the case of the AA class, the boiler change was not necessitated by the condition of the boilers but due to the limitations of the original boilers. The replacement took place in the 1930s, and these locomotives gained new heights of reliability, before they were withdrawn in 1957 (at the same time as the Q class). All of these boilers were then put back into the AB class pool, and were reused on engines of that class. In all, 6 separate classes used the standard AB boiler. When Q, AA and G class locomotives were scrapped in the 1950s, the boilers were overhauled to keep locomotives of A, AB, and WAB serviceable. =Tenders= Throughout their NZR careers, the AB class were known for their Vanderbilt tenders - one of three classes to use this tender, the others being the re- built G class 4-6-2, and the later J/Ja/Jb class 4-8-2 engines. The tenders, although satisfactory, suffered from having been constructed too lightly for the intended task, and were also prone to rusting, particularly around the frame channels. This necessitated the complete replacement of the tender frames from some locomotives, although not all were treated so. The standard AB tender design was adapted for the three-cylinder G class locomotive 4-6-2 tender locomotive rebuilds of 1937. These tenders had a more substantial tender underframe and was also unique in that the body was of welded construction rather than the traditional riveted style. As such, they became known as the 'G' style tender. When the six locomotives were withdrawn in 1956, their tenders were fitted to AB class locomotives. Further G type tenders were constructed later on by Addington Railway Workshopss (Christchurch) and Otahuhu Workshopss (Auckland) for AB class locomotives whose tenders were not considered to be economically repairable. However, this was not always the case: * AB 688 received a 'G' type tender to replace its original tender, which was wrecked in the Blind River derailment of 25 February 1948. This accident was attributed to the lack of a reliable speedometer on the locomotive, causing relief driver Jim Gurr to misjudge his speed. * AB 743 received a 'G' type tender after it was derailed by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake centred near Inangahua Junction on 24 May 1968. The locomotive was hauling a goods train from Greymouth to Westport when the earthquake struck, causing the locomotive's tender to fall onto its side. The damaged tender was written off, and a new 'G' type tender was constructed to replace it. With 141 members of this type in New Zealand, tenders were inevitably swapped with other locomotives. For example, a locomotive undergoing overhaul might lose its good-condition tender to another with a poor-condition tender to speed up the process of out shopping the second locomotive. All tenders of the type were numbered; the number was made out of weld and was positioned just below the tender headlight bracket. The tenders initially rode on drawing x-6002 standard bogies fitted with grease-lubricated bearings. Later, drawing x-10161 bogies, still fitted with grease-lubricated bearings were substituted on some locomotives as they came in for an overhaul. A later variant was the drawing x-11183 'Timken' roller-bearing bogie fitted to the WAB class conversions of 1947-57 and as used under the G class locomotive tenders from 1937. Enthusiasts were able to identify these different types of bogies by their design characteristics - for example, the x-6002 bogies had a prominent journal box and were made of steel bar sections. = Frame replacement = During the late 1950s to early 1960s, many older AB class locomotives were being withdrawn as they wore out and were replaced by locomotives displaced from other regions. With many engines still in relatively good condition, these engines were cannabalised following withdrawal to keep other engines going until they were either worn out or replaced by the new diesel locomotives then being purchased by NZR. This became a fairly common practice at the time; as the locomotives were of a standard design, parts could be taken from any engine to ensure another could keep running for some time to come. One example of this was AB 792, one of the ten WAB class conversions from 1947‚Äì57. Shopped for an 'A' grade overhaul at Hillside Workshops, the locomotive had a cracked mainframe but was otherwise in mechanically good condition. It was decided to use part of the good- condition frames from under AB 661, then recently withdrawn, to replace the damaged section from 792. The locomotive's frame was then altered by cutting the affected section out and fitting the new frame section, ex-661. This meant that certain locomotives should have changed identity - the identity of the locomotive is attached (supposedly) to the frame of the locomotive. Therefore, AB 792 should have become AB 661 as a result of the frame repairs. However, with 661 written off and 792 being a younger locomotive that still had an economic career ahead, the NZR would not have considered 'returning' 661 to service and 'scrapping' 792.  Withdrawal  The majority of the class was withdrawn from NZR services during the 1960s, as diesel traction replaced steam, with the last concentrations of the AB class being located on the West Coast and in Southland. Many of those withdrawn were South Island locomotives which had reached the end of their economic lives between 1963 and 1967 (when the DJ class diesels arrived) and were replaced by ex-North Island locomotives. By 1971, several still remained on the books at the close of steam operations on the NZR. Three remained on NZR books in 1972 - AB's 778 and 795 remained at Lyttelton to heat the carriages for the \\"Boat Train\\", formerly known in an informal manner as the \\"Jackaroo\\", while AB 663 remained either at Greymouth's Elmer Lane locomotive depot or at Dunedin. With interest for a nostalgic steam-operated train growing, both 778 and 795 were restored that same year for the famous Kingston Flyer. AB 663 was used initially at Dunedin for spare parts to keep 778 and 795, now named David McKellar and Greenvale respectively.  Names  AB 608 gained the notable distinction of being named Passchendaele in 1918 to commemorate the NZR staff who had been killed in the First World War. The locomotive had its nameplates removed in the 1940s, and they were placed on display in the Christchurch and Dunedin railway stations. Two replicas were made in 1963 for the NZR centenary event, and these are held by the New Zealand Railway & Locomotive Society. Other reproductions have been made, including one for the KiwiRail War Memorial at Hutt Workshops, which was dedicated in 2010. This was the only steam locomotive to be named after 1877. AB 663 was named Sharon Lee when it was restored to running condition in 1997. The locomotive is named after Sharon Lee Welch, daughter of Mainline Steam Trust principle Ian Welch. AB 778 and AB 795 were named David McKellar (778) and Greenvale (795) respectively by NZR in 1971 when they were overhauled for the Kingston Flyer heritage train between Lumsden and Kingston. The track now only runs between Kingston and Fairlight.  Preservation  Seven AB class locomotives have been preserved: * AB 608 Passchendaele was donated by NZR to the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society in 1967 as the class leader of the AB class. It was towed to Ferrymead in 1972 and remained there until 1993 when Steam Incorporated of Paekakariki indicated an interest in leasing and restoring 608. It was towed to Wellington as part of a Steam Inc excursion in 1993, and work began to restore the locomotive in 1997 with the stripping of the engine unit for restoration. The locomotive has since received a new tender body, and been fitted with stronger 'Janney yoke' drawgear to facilitate towing of the locomotive by mainline freight train if necessary. AB 608 was recommissioned on 25 April 2014 and is now operational and mainline certified. * AB 663 Sharon Lee was used as the spare parts source for the Kingston Flyer until purchased by Ian Welch of the Mainline Steam Heritage Trust in 1983. It was returned to service in 1997 with a tender formerly with AB 811 which had been scrapped. It has been named Sharon Lee after one of Ian Welch's daughters and is notable in having its headlight mounted on the front of the smokebox (not the top as was correct) and having been converted to burn oil instead of coal making it the first oil- fired pacific. * AB 699 is owned by the Pleasant Point Railway & Historical Society and runs regularly on their line between Pleasant Point and Keanes Crossing, a distance of 2 km. Purchased for static display at Pleasant Point station, it arrived on 5th November 1970. It was later restored to operating condition, first steaming in 1974 and has been a popular attraction at the railway ever since. * AB 745 was derailed by embankment subsidence at HƒÅwera in 1956. Rather than recover the locomotive, NZR salvaged all parts from the right-hand (driver's) side of the locomotive, and buried it along with several V series insulated meat vans. The engine unit of 745 was dug out of the embankment in 2001. As of September 2012, AB 745 was owned by The Taranaki Flyer Society Inc., and they were restoring the locomotive in the former railway goods shed in Stratford, Taranaki, New Zealand. It is now owned by the Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust after the Taranaki Flyer Society Inc.'s leased building was vacated at the end of 2013. AB will be a long-term restoration project by the railway. * AB 778 is owned by the Kingston Flyer. Named David McKellar. It is currently out of service requiring a boiler overhaul. * AB 795, converted from a WAB class 4-6-4T tank locomotive in the period 1947‚Äì57, is owned by the Kingston Flyer. Named Greenvale. It is maintained in operational condition but is currently stored. * AB 832, the last steam locomotive to work in the North Island when steam ended there in 1967, was donated by NZR to the Museum of Transport and Technology. Stored pending restoration at MOTAT 2. It was on long-term lease to the Glenbrook Vintage Railway and was stored at the GVR's Pukeoware depot until August 2018.  Similar locomotives  The WAB class of 1917 was essentially a tank locomotive version of the AB class.

In St. Lucie County, CR 707 is part of the Indian River Lagoon ‚Äì Treasure Coast Scenic Highway, a Florida Scenic Highway. Route description Fort Pierce, before the road was decommissioned and turned over for county maintenance. CR 707 exists in two sections. One extends along Beach Road, a former segment of SR A1A, from US 1 and SR 811 in Jupiter to CR 708 in Jupiter Island. The northern segment follows an old alignment of Dixie Highway from CR 723 in Stuart to SR A1A in downtown Fort Pierce. This segment is also known as Dixie Highway and Indian River Drive and runs parallel to the Florida East Coast Railroad tracks from Fort Pierce to Jensen Beach. Communities served by this segment include Eden, Walton, Ankona, and Eldred. History In addition to the two segments of CR 707, SR 707 also included of Old Dixie Highway from the south end of the Old Roosevelt Bridge in Stuart to the intersection of Savannah Road (CR 723) near Rio, was transferred to the city of Stuart in 2012 or 2013.Roadway Transfer Agreement, June 6, 2012 (pp. 19-23)Letter from Martin County to FDOT, November 22, 2013 This segment is not part of CR 707 and is maintained locally. Unlike the St. Lucie County segment of the former SR 707, the Martin County segment did not parallel the FEC rails as the former alignment of Dixie Highway. This was done by a former alignment of SR A1A, now designated County Road A1A, from Stuart to Jupiter. Former alignments of Dixie Highway in southern Florida include SR 811 and County Road 811 in Palm Beach County, SR 811 and the former SR 5A in Broward County, and SR 909 and the former SR 815 in Miami-Dade County. The southern segment of CR 707 was formerly designated \\"SR A1A Alternate\\" before it was SR 707. This alternate designation still continues south from CR 707's southern terminus along SR 811. Related routes =Jensen Beach Boulevard= A July 2010 photograph of Savannah Road south of Jensen Beach Boulevard, indicating the transition from SR 732 to CR 707A at this intersection. Jensen Beach Boulevard, a east-west street, was formerly signed State Road 707A as a spur route connecting Federal Highway (US 1) in Jensen Beach to Indian River Drive (CR 707) in Ocean Breeze. In the 1990s, the Florida Department of Transportation removed the State Road from several routes in the Stuart area, including SR 707A. Jensen Beach Boulevard was then redesignated County Road 732, not to be confused with SR 732, which is the nearby Jensen Beach Causeway. However, conflicting signage on Jensen Beach Boulevard indicates it is part of SR 732, CR 732, as well as County Road 707A. At its westernmost intersection with US 1 it is signed CR 732. At an intersection with Royal Park Drive, the road is signed as SR 732 on a green street sign. At Savannah Road (CR 723), a green sign depicts this intersection as the eastern terminus of SR 732 and the western terminus of CR 707A. (see image at left) A FDOT-published county map from February 2002 listed the road as solely CR 732. However, the map's 2015 update shows the road as solely CR 707A. =County Road 723 (formerly State Road 723)= The former State Road 723 was also a signed north-south spur of SR 707. A 1.8-mile-long north-south street locally known as Savannah Road, the former State Road (and current County Road 723) extends from an intersection with Dixie Highway (SR 707) and Cardinal Avenue in Rio to an intersection with Jensen Beach Boulevard (former SR 707A/current CR 732) in Jensen Beach. Savannah Road is primarily a commercial highway even though it is lined with residential developments. Shopping centers are clustered near its interchange with Jensen Beach Boulevard while business and industrial parks straddle the county road near its southern terminus. State road shields were removed in the 1990s.

The Palazzo Venezia served as the embassy of the Republic of Venice in Rome. One side of the Piazza is the site of Italy's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the Altare della Patria, part of the Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II, first king of Italy. The piazza or square is at the foot of the Capitoline Hill and next to Trajan's Forum. The main artery, the Via di Fori Imperiali begins there and leads past the Roman Forum to the Colosseum. Capitalizing on this modern and ancient symbolism--and the useful open space--Piazza Venezia was the location of public speeches given by the Italian dictator Mussolini to crowds of his supporters in the 1920s-1940s. In 2009, during excavations in the middle of the square for the construction of the Rome C Metro Line (station Venezia), remains of the emperor Hadrian's Athenaeum were unearthed.Unearthed in Rome‚Äôs New Subway: Extinct Elephants and Persian Peach Pits, The New York Times, December 18, 2017.

After an extensive restoration completed in 2000, it was held by The University Of Chicago Booth School Of Business. As of 2019, the building served as the Singapore campus for Amity Global Institute. History The mansion belonged to Chaozhou-born businessman Tan Yeok Nee who built it in 1885. It is the only survivor of the Four Mansions (ÂõõÂ§ßÂéù) built in the late 19th century. Tan was born in 1827. To escape poverty in his village, he came to Nanyang where he traded textiles. Later, he planted pepper and spices in Johor and became a port owner. In addition, Tan established a joint venture with another Teochew tycoon, Tan Seng Bo, and Chang, a Hoklo (Hokkien) leader, in the then legal opium and liquor trades. Three years later, Tan Yeok Nee immigrated to Singapore, where he built this \\"House of Administration\\". He soon amassed a great fortune through his involvement with his trades and the ownership of lucrative property. Tan's house is one of two surviving examples of traditional Chinese mansions in Singapore; the other is the River House in Clarke Quay. Tan lived in this mansion for most of his life; he died in China at age 75. He outlived his sons and the house was left to his eight grandsons. At the turn of the 20th century, when the Singapore-Johor Railway was being built, the house was acquired for use by the Tank Road Station master. In 1907, the government transferred Tan's house to the Anglican Church, which established St Mary's Home and School for Eurasian Girls for 20,000 Straits dollars. After the Home was closed in 1932, it was renamed as the Temple House and was used as a boarding house. On 28 May 1938, the Salvation Army moved its Singapore headquarters to the House. The house remained the Salvation Army's centre of operations for over 50 years, except during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Between 1942 and 1945, the occupying Japanese forces used the House as part of its army's headquarters. After the war, it was found shattered and torn to pieces by repeated bombing and looting. The Salvation Army spent a considerable amount on repairs and rebuilding over the next few years. In July 1951, it was officially reopened by Governor Sir Franklin Gimson. The House of Tan Yeok Nee and Tan Si Chong Su Temple, along with three other historical sites, were gazetted as national monument on 29 November 1974 because their typically Chinese architecture is a fast vanishing sight in Singapore. In 1991, the Salvation Army's headquarters was relocated to its present location at Bishan and the house was sold for to Teo Lay Swee who wanted to extend his adjacent hotel, Cockpit Hotel. The expansion plan was dropped when the Teo family sold the hotel and its surrounding land, including the House to a consortium led by the Wing Tai Group in 1996 for . Wing Tai which invested for its restoration. =Restoration works= [University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 2000 for its Asian campus, before moving to Hong Kong in 2013, with the last Singapore cohort graduated in 2015. The ownership of the House was changed several times since. In 2007, Wing Tai sold the House, with the adjacent redeveloped Visioncrest office block to Union Investment Real Estate AG for . ERC Holdings then acquired the House for in May 2012, before selling it to Perennial Real Estate Holdings for just under in September 2013. Perennial, together with Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine set up Ming Yi Guan in the House from 2017 to 2018. The House was placed on the selling block for in 2018. In 2019, Amity Global Institute moved its school to the House. Architecture The House of Tan Yeok Nee occupies up to 2,000 square metres of elevated land along Clemenceau Avenue. The mansion has been carefully restored with great sensitivity to ensure that the original architecture and character of the house is kept intact. The walls, tiles, roof, pillars, carvings and pottery were restored to their original state of a century ago through painstaking research. However, contemporary facilities and equipment have also been incorporated to adapt the building for modern-day usage. With the wide array of beautifully restored traditional Chinese decorative elements and the convenience of present-day state-of-the-art technology around the house, this combination of 'old' and 'new' provides a unique environment rich in history and culture. The front and back portions of the house face east and west. Pillars on the front door are made of marble with colourful carvings of stories reflecting the lives of Tan Yeok Nee's ancestors in Chaozhou. The back of the house has a distinctive style exhibited by beams with special Teochew tiles, a main pillar decorated with gold-plated carvings, and a marble floor. Exquisite, colourful tiles reflect Chinese people characters and animals. The House of Tan Yeok Nee is typical of Teochew-style residential buildings. The structure exhibits the harmony of Yin and Yang, shown at the top of the ceiling in gold, wood, water, fire, and earth ‚Äì the five elements. Armed with traditional philosophical ideas, the designer coordinated the entire building's design to reflect the balance and harmony represented by the five elements. This unique design not only enriches the artistic value of the walls, but also represents the unity of prosperity, intelligence, longevity, health and happiness.

The General Motors Company developed both components under the project name, Train Y, but later marketed them as the Aerotrain. Diesel power was provided by an EMD 567C 12-cylinder engine, which produced .(1) (2) . Two other GM Diesel engines provided current for train-heating, lighting and air-conditioning. The LWT12 was underpowered, especially on grades, and the Santa Fe and Union Pacific Railroads were required to supply a \\"helper\\" unit to assist them in service. The LWT12 was essentially an EMD SW1200 switcher locomotive, suitably geared for high-speed passenger service (83 mph) and wrapped in a distinctive aerodynamic shell. Its industrial styling was inspired by the hoods and grills of futuristic automobiles then on GM's drawing boards. Originally, the EMD LWT12 was intended to be part of an inseparable set along with ten specially designed high-speed, low-cost, passenger cars. These cars were built from bus bodies sourced from GM's GMC division which were then widened by , had their front and rear modified and were attached to a generic undercarriage. The advantages of this design were that instead of refurbishing the whole carriage, the body mounted on the undercarriage would be scrapped in whole and a complete new modified bus body would be installed in its place with all of the different technical advances that had been developed, essentially resulting in a completely new car for a fraction of the cost. Also, all parts used by these carriages were sourced internally by GM and were also used in other products. All of this meant that initial outlay, as well as maintenance costs, were significantly lower than traditional passenger cars resulting in a situation where railroad companies could offer rail fares similar to bus fares of the time. This design, as well as the EMD LWT12 were the cover feature article of the September 1955 Popular Mechanics magazine. Two of these whole train sets were built for the purpose of being driven across the United States for public viewing. Only three LWT12 units were built. The first, EMD serial number 20826, entered service on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (the Rock Island line) the Jet Rocket train between Chicago and Peoria. The unit later became the Rock Island's locomotive number 1. (1) (2) The American Car and Foundry Company constructed the train's Talgo II coaches. The Rock Island preferred the single-axle Talgo cars over the double- axle GM bus-body coaches being built for the Aerotrain. But they were also drawn to the futuristic styling of GM's locomotive, over the more traditional look of the Fairbanks Morse unit selected by ACF to pull the Talgo cars, so the railroad mated the two to form a unique lightweight consist of its own. The second and third GM diesels, EMD serial numbers 21463 and 21464, powered the two GM Aerotrain demonstrators that toured the country in 1955, before being leased to four railroads for revenue service testing in 1956-57. All of the roads rejected the Aerotrain, and the two GM demonstrators were eventually sold at great discount to the Rock Island Line, where they joined the Jet Rocket hybrid. Two of the three LWT12 locomotives continued in commuter service with the Aerotrain coaches, until retired in 1965. The EMD LWT12 locomotives and several passenger cars of the two General Motors Aerotrains are presently on display within the United States. The National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin now exhibits the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad's Aerotrain locomotive number 2. The Museum of Transportation in Kirkwood, Missouri (near St. Louis) exhibits the Rock Island's Aerotrain locomotive number 3 and two passenger cars.

Takagi's efforts to undermine the Japanese wartime government have been compared with the efforts of German Admiral Wilhelm Canaris to undermine the Nazi government, and contributed to the end of the war. Biography Takagi was born in what is now part of Hitoyoshi city Kumamoto Prefecture in Ky≈´sh≈´. He graduated from the 43rd class of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1915, ranked 27th out of 96 cadets. He served his midshipman duty aboard the cruiser and the battleship , and was assigned to and after he was commissioned an ensign. Takagi attended Navigation School and was promoted to lieutenant in 1921, after which he served as chief navigator on the destroyer , submarine tender and patrol vessel Mansh≈´. Takagi graduated from Naval War College (Japan) in 1927, upon which he was promoted to lieutenant commander and posted as naval attach√© to France until 1930. After his return, he served as private secretary to the Navy Minister for two years before being appointed commander and instructor of the Naval War College from 1933 to 1936. In 1937, Takagi was promoted to captain becoming Chief of the Navy Ministry's Research Section. While head of the government organization, Takagi often over-stretched the predefined powers of his office, acting as a political contact for the Navy through government officials and statesmen such as Fumimaro Konoe, K≈çichi Kido, and Saionji Kinmochi as well as developing contacts with intellectuals within the government. An opponent of Japan's decision to declare war on the United States, Takagi was removed from his position as Chief of the Research Section in 1942 and was reassigned as chief of staff of the Maizuru Naval District. Promoted to rear admiral on 1 May 1943, in September Takagi (due to his access and unique knowledge of classified files from his time as chief of the Research Section) was asked by Navy Minister Shigetar≈ç Shimada to compile a report analyzing Japanese defeats during the Pacific campaign of 1942. Going far beyond its original purpose, Takagi's analysis of combat evidence, conditions in the Japanese home islands, and air and shipping losses as of that year convinced him that Japan's defeat was inevitable. Believing the only solution for Japan was the elimination of the Tojo-led government and negotiation of a truce with the United States, Takagi was hesitant to present the report to Shimada, instead beginning planning for the assassination of Prime Minister Hideki T≈çj≈ç before his removal from office in July 1944. As a member of the Navy Staff College's Research Department, Takagi was encouraged by the newly appointed Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai to compose an ultrasecret document proposing the most favorable scenario for Japan's eventual withdrawal from the Pacific, a project he continued working on in cooperation with other government officials until Japan's surrender in August 1945. He later worked with Teiji Yabe, a professor of Tokyo Imperial University, on revising the Japanese constitution in October 1945. Takagi died in 1979 at his home in Chigasaki, Kanagawa, and his grave is at the temple of Tokei-ji in Kamakura.

Biography Tullio Serafin was a leading Italian opera conductor with a long career and a very broad repertoire who revived many 19th-century bel canto operas by Bellini, Rossini and Donizetti to become staples of 20th-century repertoire. He had an unparalleled reputation as a coach of young opera singers and famously harnessed and developed both Renata Tebaldi's and Maria Callas's considerable talents. Born in Rottanova (Cavarzere), near Venice, and trained in Milan, he played viola in the Orchestra of La Scala, Milan under Arturo Toscanini, later being appointed Assistant Conductor. He took over as Music Director at La Scala when Toscanini left to go to New York, and served 1909‚Äì1914, 1917‚Äì1918, and returned briefly after the Second World War, 1946 -1947. He joined the conducting staff of the Metropolitan Opera in 1924, and remained for a decade, after which he became the artistic director of the Teatro Reale in Rome. During his long career he helped further the careers of many important singers, including Rosa Ponselle, Magda Olivero, Joan Sutherland, Renata Tebaldi,and most notably Maria Callas, with whom he collaborated on many recordings. Maestro Serafin was very appreciated in Buenos Aires. During 9 seasons at the Teatro Col√≥n between 1914 and 1951, he conducted 368 opera performances of 63 different operas. This included many operas that are seldom performed, by composers such as Alfano, Catalani, Giordano, Massenet, Montemezzi, Monteverdi, Pizzetti, Respighi, Rimsky Korsakov, and Zandonai.http://www.operas-colon.com.ar/index.html Serafin was instrumental in expanding the repertory, conducting the Italian premieres of works by Alban Berg, Paul Dukas, and Benjamin Britten. He also conducted important world premieres by both Italian and American composers, such as Franco Alfano, Italo Montemezzi, Deems Taylor, and Howard Hanson. His goddaughter was the soprano Claudia Pinza Bozzolla.

Reingestion is also practiced by a few species of rodent (such as the beaver, capybara, and guinea pig), some marsupials (the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and possibly the coppery ringtail possum (Pseudochirops cupreus)) and one species of primate (the sportive lemur (Lepilemur mustelinus)).

Food passes through the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, where nutrients are initially absorbed ineffectively, and then into the colon. Through reverse peristalsis, the food is forced back into the cecum where it is broken down into simple sugars (i.e. monosaccharides) by bacterial fermentation. The cecotrope then passes through the colon, the anus, and is eliminated by the animal and then reingested. The process occurs 4 to 8 hours after eating. This type of reingestion to obtain more nutrients is similar to the chewing of cud in cattle. The process of cecotrophy can have irregularities. This leads to the lack of assimilation of nutrients (vitamins, amino acids), which are synthesized by microorganisms in cecotrophs.

The h-index correlates with obvious success indicators such as winning the Nobel Prize, being accepted for research fellowships and holding positions at top universities. The index is based on the set of the scientist's most cited papers and the number of citations that they have received in other publications. The index can also be applied to the productivity and impact of a scholarly journal as well as a group of scientists, such as a department or university or country. The index was suggested in 2005 by Jorge E. Hirsch, a physicist at UC San Diego, as a tool for determining theoretical physicists' relative quality and is sometimes called the Hirsch index or Hirsch number.  Definition and purpose  h-index from a plot of decreasing citations for numbered papers The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given author/journal has published h papers that have each been cited at least h times. The index is designed to improve upon simpler measures such as the total number of citations or publications. The index works best when comparing scholars working in the same field; citation conventions differ widely among different fields.  Calculation  Formally, if f is the function that corresponds to the number of citations for each publication, we compute the h-index as follows: First we order the values of f from the largest to the lowest value. Then, we look for the last position in which f is greater than or equal to the position (we call h this position). For example, if we have a researcher with 5 publications A, B, C, D, and E with 10, 8, 5, 4, and 3 citations, respectively, the h-index is equal to 4 because the 4th publication has 4 citations and the 5th has only 3. In contrast, if the same publications have 25, 8, 5, 3, and 3 citations, then the index is 3 (i.e. the 3rd position) because the fourth paper has only 3 citations. :f(A)=10, f(B)=8, f(C)=5, f(D)=4, f(E)=3 ‚Üí h-index=4 :f(A)=25, f(B)=8, f(C)=5, f(D)=3, f(E)=3 ‚Üí h-index=3 If we have the function f ordered in decreasing order from the largest value to the lowest one, we can compute the h-index as follows: :h-index (f) = \\\\max\\\\\\\\{i\\\\in\\\\N: f(i)\\\\ge i\\\\\\\\} The Hirsch index is analogous to the Eddington number, an earlier metric used for evaluating cyclists. The h-index serves as an alternative to more traditional journal impact factor metrics in the evaluation of the impact of the work of a particular researcher. Because only the most highly cited articles contribute to the h-index, its determination is a simpler process. Hirsch has demonstrated that h has high predictive value for whether a scientist has won honors like National Academy membership or the Nobel Prize. The h-index grows as citations accumulate and thus it depends on the \\"academic age\\" of a researcher.  Input data  The h-index can be manually determined by using citation databases or using automatic tools. Subscription-based databases such as Scopus and the Web of Science provide automated calculators. From July 2011 Google have provided an automatically calculated h-index and i10-index within their own Google Scholar profile.Google Scholar Citations Help, retrieved 2012-09-18. In addition, specific databases, such as the INSPIRE-HEP database can automatically calculate the h-index for researchers working in high energy physics. Each database is likely to produce a different h for the same scholar, because of different coverage. A detailed study showed that the Web of Science has strong coverage of journal publications, but poor coverage of high impact conferences. Scopus has better coverage of conferences, but poor coverage of publications prior to 1996; Google Scholar has the best coverage of conferences and most journals (though not all), but like Scopus has limited coverage of pre-1990 publications. (preprint of paper published as 'Impact of data sources on citation counts and rankings of LIS faculty: Web of Science versus Scopus and Google Scholar', in Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, Vol. 58, No. 13, 2007, 2105‚Äì25) The exclusion of conference proceedings papers is a particular problem for scholars in computer science, where conference proceedings are considered an important part of the literature.. Google Scholar has been criticized for producing \\"phantom citations,\\" including gray literature in its citation counts, and failing to follow the rules of Boolean logic when combining search terms. For example, the Meho and Yang study found that Google Scholar identified 53% more citations than Web of Science and Scopus combined, but noted that because most of the additional citations reported by Google Scholar were from low-impact journals or conference proceedings, they did not significantly alter the relative ranking of the individuals. It has been suggested that in order to deal with the sometimes wide variation in h for a single academic measured across the possible citation databases, one should assume false negatives in the databases are more problematic than false positives and take the maximum h measured for an academic.  Comparing results across fields and career levels  Little systematic investigation has been done on how the h-index behaves over different institutions, nations, times and academic fields. Hirsch suggested that, for physicists, a value for h of about 12 might be typical for advancement to tenure (associate professor) at major [US] research universities. A value of about 18 could mean a full professorship, 15‚Äì20 could mean a fellowship in the American Physical Society, and 45 or higher could mean membership in the United States National Academy of Sciences. Hirsch estimated that after 20 years a \\"successful scientist\\" would have an h-index of 20, an \\"outstanding scientist\\" would have an h-index of 40, and a \\"truly unique\\" individual would have an h-index of 60. For the most highly cited scientists in the period 1983‚Äì2002, Hirsch identified the top 10 in the life sciences (in order of decreasing h): Solomon H. Snyder, h = 191; David Baltimore, h = 160; Robert C. Gallo, h = 154; Pierre Chambon, h = 153; Bert Vogelstein, h = 151; Salvador Moncada, h = 143; Charles A. Dinarello, h = 138; Tadamitsu Kishimoto, h = 134; Ronald M. Evans, h = 127; Axel Ullrich, h = 120; and Ralph L. Brinster, h = 120. Among 36 new inductees in the National Academy of Sciences in biological and biomedical sciences in 2005, the median h-index was 57. However, Hirsch noted that values of h will vary among disparate fields. Among the 22 scientific disciplines listed in the Essential Science Indicators citation thresholds [thus excluding non-science academics], physics has the second most citations after space science. During the period January 1, 2000 ‚Äì February 28, 2010, a physicist had to receive 2073 citations to be among the most cited 1% of physicists in the world. The threshold for space science is the highest (2236 citations), and physics is followed by clinical medicine (1390) and molecular biology & genetics (1229). Most disciplines, such as environment/ecology (390), have fewer scientists, fewer papers, and fewer citations. Therefore, these disciplines have lower citation thresholds in the Essential Science Indicators, with the lowest citation thresholds observed in social sciences (154), computer science (149), and multidisciplinary sciences (147). Numbers are very different in social science disciplines: The Impact of the Social Sciences team at London School of Economics found that social scientists in the United Kingdom had lower average h-indices. The h-indices for (\\"full\\") professors, based on Google Scholar data ranged from 2.8 (in law), through 3.4 (in political science), 3.7 (in sociology), 6.5 (in geography) and 7.6 (in economics). On average across the disciplines, a professor in the social sciences had an h-index about twice that of a lecturer or a senior lecturer, though the difference was the smallest in geography.  Advantages  Hirsch intended the h-index to address the main disadvantages of other bibliometric indicators, such as total number of papers or total number of citations. Total number of papers does not account for the quality of scientific publications, while total number of citations can be disproportionately affected by participation in a single publication of major influence (for instance, methodological papers proposing successful new techniques, methods or approximations, which can generate a large number of citations), or having many publications with few citations each. The h-index is intended to measure simultaneously the quality and quantity of scientific output.  Criticism  There are a number of situations in which h may provide misleading information about a scientist's output: Most of these however are not exclusive to the h-index. * The h-index does not account for the typical number of citations in different fields. It has been stated that citation behavior in general is affected by field- dependent factors, which may invalidate comparisons not only across disciplines but even within different fields of research of one discipline. * The h-index discards the information contained in author placement in the authors' list, which in some scientific fields is significant. * The h-index has been found in one study to have slightly less predictive accuracy and precision than the simpler measure of mean citations per paper. However, this finding was contradicted by another study by Hirsch. * The h-index is a natural number that reduces its discriminatory power. Ruane and Tol therefore propose a rational h-index that interpolates between h and h + 1. * The h-index does not provide a significantly more accurate measure of impact than the total number of citations for a given scholar. In particular, by modeling the distribution of citations among papers as a random integer partition and the h-index as the Durfee square of the partition, Yong arrived at the formula h\\\\approx 0.54\\\\sqrt N, where N is the total number of citations, which, for mathematics members of the National Academy of Sciences, turns out to provide an accurate (with errors typically within 10‚Äì20 percent) approximation of h-index in most cases. * The h-index can be manipulated through self- citations, and if based on Google Scholar output, then even computer-generated documents can be used for that purpose, e.g. using SCIgen. * The h-index can be manipulated by coercive citation, a practice in which an editor of a journal forces authors to add spurious citations to their own articles before the journal will agree to publish it.  Alternatives and modifications  Various proposals to modify the h-index in order to emphasize different features have been made.Katsaros D., Sidiropoulos A., Manolopous Y., (2007), Age Decaying H-Index for Social Network of Citations in Proceedings of Workshop on Social Aspects of the Web Poznan, Poland, April 27, 2007 As the variants have proliferated, comparative studies have become possible showing that most proposals are highly correlated with the original h-index and therefore largely redundant, although alternative indexes may be important to decide between comparable CVs, as often the case in evaluation processes. * An individual h-index normalized by the number of authors has been proposed: h_I = h^2/N_a^{(T)}, with N_a^{(T)} being the number of authors considered in the h papers. It was found that the distribution of the h-index, although it depends on the field, can be normalized by a simple rescaling factor. For example, assuming as standard the hs for biology, the distribution of h for mathematics collapse with it if this h is multiplied by three, that is, a mathematician with h = 3 is equivalent to a biologist with h = 9\\\\. This method has not been readily adopted, perhaps because of its complexity. It might be simpler to divide citation counts by the number of authors before ordering the papers and obtaining the h-index, as originally suggested by Hirsch. * The m-index is defined as h/n, where n is the number of years since the first published paper of the scientist; also called m-quotient. * There are a number of models proposed to incorporate the relative contribution of each author to a paper, for instance by accounting for the rank in the sequence of authors. * A generalization of the h-index and some other indices that gives additional information about the shape of the author's citation function (heavy-tailed, flat/peaked, etc.) has been proposed. * Three additional metrics have been proposed: h2 lower, h2 center, and h2 upper, to give a more accurate representation of the distribution shape. The three h2 metrics measure the relative area within a scientist's citation distribution in the low impact area, h2 lower, the area captured by the h-index, h2 center, and the area from publications with the highest visibility, h2 upper. Scientists with high h2 upper percentages are perfectionists, whereas scientists with high h2 lower percentages are mass producers. As these metrics are percentages, they are intended to give a qualitative description to supplement the quantitative h-index. * The g-index can be seen as the h-index for an averaged citations count. * It has been argued that \\"For an individual researcher, a measure such as Erd≈ës number captures the structural properties of network whereas the h-index captures the citation impact of the publications. One can be easily convinced that ranking in coauthorship networks should take into account both measures to generate a realistic and acceptable ranking.\\" Several author ranking systems such as eigenfactor (based on eigenvector centrality) have been proposed already, for instance the Phys Author Rank Algorithm.; see also * The c-index accounts not only for the citations but for the quality of the citations in terms of the collaboration distance between citing and cited authors. A scientist has c-index n if n of [his/her] N citations are from authors which are at collaboration distance at least n, and the other (N ‚àí n) citations are from authors which are at collaboration distance at most n. * An s-index, accounting for the non-entropic distribution of citations, has been proposed and it has been shown to be in a very good correlation with h. * The e-index, the square root of surplus citations for the h-set beyond h2, complements the h-index for ignored citations, and therefore is especially useful for highly cited scientists and for comparing those with the same h-index (iso-h-index group). * Because the h-index was never meant to measure future publication success, recently, a group of researchers has investigated the features that are most predictive of future h-index. It is possible to try the predictions using an online tool. However, later work has shown that since h-index is a cumulative measure, it contains intrinsic auto-correlation that led to significant overestimation of its predictability. Thus, the true predictability of future h-index is much lower compared to what has been claimed before. *The i10-index indicates the number of academic publications an author has written that have been cited by at least ten sources. It was introduced in July 2011 by Google as part of their work on Google Scholar.Connor, James; Google Scholar Blog. \\"Google Scholar Citations Open To All\\", Google, 16 November 2011, retrieved 24 November 2011 * The h-index has been shown to have a strong discipline bias. However, a simple normalization h/\\\\langle h \\\\rangle_d by the average h of scholars in a discipline d is an effective way to mitigate this bias, obtaining a universal impact metric that allows comparison of scholars across different disciplines. Of course this method does not deal with academic age bias. * The h-index can be timed to analyze its evolution during one's career, employing different time windows. * The o-index corresponds to the geometric mean of the h-index and the most cited paper of a researcher. *The RA-index accommodates improving the sensitivity of the h-index on the number of highly cited papers and has many cited paper and uncited paper under the h-core. This improvement can enhance the measurement sensitivity of the h-index.  Applications  Indices similar to the h-index have been applied outside of author level metrics. The h-index has been applied to Internet Media, such as YouTube channels. It is defined as the number of videos with ‚â• h √ó 105 views. When compared with a video creator's total view count, the h-index and g-index better capture both productivity and impact in a single metric. A successive Hirsch-type-index for institutions has also been devised. A scientific institution has a successive Hirsch-type-index of i when at least i researchers from that institution have an h-index of at least i.

The ability to virtually instantaneously change the growth direction of their columnar morphology, through simple variations in the direction of the incident vapor flux, leads to a wide spectrum of columnar forms.A. Lakhtakia and R. Messier, Sculptured Thin Films: Nanoengineered Morphology and Optics (SPIE Press, Bellingham, WA, USA, 2005). Forms These forms can be: # two-dimensional, ranging from the simple slanted columns and chevrons to the more complex C- and S-shaped morphologies # three-dimensional, including simple helixes and superhelixes # combinations of two- and three-dimensional forms. Properties The column diameter and the column separation normal to the thickness direction of any STF are nominally constant. The column diameter can range from about 10 to 300 nm, while the density may lie between its theoretical maximum value to less than 20% thereof. The crystallinity must be at a scale smaller than the column diameter. The chemical composition is essentially unlimited, ranging from insulators to semiconductors to metals. Most recently, polymeric STFs have been deposited by combining physical and chemical vapor deposition processes; and deposition on micropatterned substrates has also been carried out. Uses To date, the chief applications of STFs are in optics as polarization filters, Bragg filters, and spectral hole filters. At visible and infrared wavelengths, a single-section STF is a unidirectionally nonhomogeneous continuum with direction-dependent properties. Several sections can be grown consecutively into a multisection STF, which can be conceived of as an optical circuit that can be integrated with electronic circuitry on a chip. Being porous, an STF can act as a sensor of fluids and can be impregnated with liquid crystals for switching applications too. Applications as low-permittivity barrier layers in electronic chips as well as solar cells have also been suggested.

The show was developed by Ronald D. Moore and executive produced by Moore and David Eick as a re- imagining of the 1978 Battlestar Galactica television series created by Glen A. Larson. The pilot for the series first aired as a three-hour miniseries (comprising four broadcast hours in two parts) in December 2003 on the Sci-Fi Channel, which was then followed by four regular seasons, ending its run on March 20, 2009. The cast includes Edward James Olmos, Mary McDonnell, Katee Sackhoff, Jamie Bamber, James Callis, Tricia Helfer, and Grace Park. The series garnered a wide range of critical acclaim both at the time of its run and in the years since, including a Peabody Award, the Television Critics Association's Program of the Year Award, a placement inside Times 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time, and 19 Emmy nominations for its writing, directing, costume design, visual effects, sound mixing, and sound editing, with three Emmy wins (visual effects and sound editing). In 2019, The New York Times placed the show on its list of \\"The 20 Best TV Dramas Since The Sopranos\\", a 20-year period many critics call \\"the golden age of television.\\" Battlestar Galactica is set in a distant star system, where a civilization of humans lives on a group of planets known as the Twelve Colonies. In the past, the Colonies had been at war with an android race of their own creation, known as the Cylons. With the unwitting help of a human scientist named Gaius Baltar, the Cylons launch a sudden sneak attack on the Colonies, laying waste to the planets and devastating their populations. Out of a population of several billion, there are about 50,000 human survivors; most were aboard civilian space ships that were not near the initial attacks. Of all the Colonial Fleet, the eponymous Battlestar Galactica appears to be the only military capital ship that survived the attack. Under the leadership of Colonial Fleet officer Commander William \\"Bill\\" Adama (Olmos) and now-President Laura Roslin (McDonnell), the Galactica and its crew take up the task of leading the small fugitive fleet of survivors into space in search of a fabled thirteenth colony known as Earth. The series spawned the prequel spin-off TV series Caprica, which aired for one season in 2010. Another spin-off, Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome, was released in November 2012 as a web series of ten 10-minute episodes, and aired on February 10, 2013, on Syfy as a televised movie.  Series overview  Battlestar Galactica continued from the 2003 miniseries to chronicle the journey of the last surviving humans from the Twelve Colonies of Kobol, after their nuclear annihilation by the Cylons. The survivors are led by President Laura Roslin and Commander William Adama in a ragtag fleet of ships with the Battlestar Galactica, an old, but powerful warship, as its command ship. Pursued by Cylons intent on wiping out the remnants of the human race, the survivors travel across the galaxy looking for the fabled and long-lost \\"thirteenth\\" colony: Earth. Unlike most space opera series, Battlestar Galactica has no humanoid aliens (the antagonists are man-made Cylon androids), the primary armaments used by both military forces utilize bullets, rail guns, and missiles instead of lasers, and the series intentionally avoids technobabble. Instead, most of the stories deal with the apocalyptic fallout of the destruction of the Twelve Colonies upon the survivors, and the moral choices they must make as they deal with the decline of the human race and their war with the Cylons. Stories also portray the concept of perpetuated cycles of hate and violence driving the human-Cylon conflict, and religion, with the implication of a \\"God\\" whose possibly angelic agents appear to certain main characters (most notably Gaius Baltar). Over the course of the show's four seasons, the war between the Colonials and the Cylons takes many twists and turns. Despite the animosity on both sides, the humans and a faction of the Cylons eventually form an uneasy alliance, in the wake of the Cylon Civil War. The Cylon leader, a humanoid Cylon \\"Number One\\" named John Cavil, precipitated the schism in the Cylon ranks. Cavil deceives the other models by obsessively hiding the identities and origins of the remaining five humanoid Cylon models, the \\"Final Five\\", who, known only to him, are a more ancient type of Cylon, created by a previous iteration of human civilization. Other plotlines involve the mysterious destiny of Kara \\"Starbuck\\" Thrace, who is the subject of a prophecy claiming that she is the \\"Harbinger of Death\\" who will \\"lead them all [humanity] to its end\\", as well as the redemption of Gaius Baltar through the Cylons' monotheistic religion, after he becomes a pariah within the fleet. In the final episodes, an inexplicably resurrected Kara Thrace leads the surviving humans and their Cylon allies to a new planet, which Adama names \\"Earth\\". The first group of survivors settle in ancient Africa. The \\"real\\" Earth that the Colonials had searched for during their years in space was revealed in an earlier episode to have been originally inhabited thousands of years before by a previous form of humanoid Cylons; the \\"Final Five\\" were the last of these Cylons. Ironically, these humanoid Cylons had created their own Centurion robotic slaves, who waged a nuclear attack against their masters, devastating the planet and making it uninhabitable. The new Earth is found to be inhabited by early humans, who are genetically compatible with the humans from the Galactica and the rest of the fleet, but who possess only the most rudimentary civilization. The surviving humans and humanoid Cylons settle on the new planet Earth; they discard all technology, destroying the fleet by flying it into the Sun, in an attempt to break the human-Cylon cycle of conflict and begin anew with the tribal humans already present on the new Earth. The surviving Cylon Centurions are given possession of the remaining Cylon Basestar, and proceed to jump away from Earth. In the final scenes, modern-day Earth humans are shown to be descendants of the colonists, their humanoid Cylon allies, and the early humans. At the end of the series finale, an angelic Baltar and Cylon Number Six are walking down a sidewalk in modern-day New York City. They are unseen and unheard by the people around them. As the two walk, they notice technologically advanced robots, computers, and other cybernetic devices, and they talk about the technological advancements the humans have made since the Colonists and Humanoid Cylons first arrived to this Earth, over 150,000 years earlier. Cylon Number Six and Baltar have an exchange over one of the ongoing themes from the series: \\"All of this has happened before. But the question remains, does all of this have to happen again?\\" Consequently, the revelation that Battlestar Galactica takes place in our collective prehistoric past means that unlike most space opera science fiction stories, the series is a fictional tale of ancient history rather than future history and serves as a fictional tale of origin for modern humanity.

The show attempted to maintain its realism by referencing familiar elements of contemporary history ‚Äì Laura Roslin's swearing in on Colonial One directly \\"cited the swearing in of Lyndon B. Johnson after the Kennedy assassination\\" ‚Äì and the developing political situation since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Many people have drawn parallels between the Cylons and Al Qaeda\\" and according to The Guardian \\"Battlestar Galactica is the only award-winning drama that dares tackle the war on terror\\". The show has also tackled issues regarding terrorist sleeper cells with stories involving the reality and fear of Cylon suicide attacks, Cylon Number 5 (Aaron Doral) in the episode called Litmus, sneaks aboard the Galactica and blows himself up in the middle of the corridor and sleeper agent Lt. Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii activates after destroying a Cylon basestar and shooting Commander Adama at the end of season 1. (Note that Sharon, as with some of the other human-form Cylons, had no idea that she was a Cylon.) Similar themes are revisited in season 3 (Episode 3.1, \\"Occupation\\") with a far different perspective: the humans, rather than the Cylons, are the suicide bombers. It has been suggested that these plotlines extensively \\"hinted at war-on-terrorism overtones.\\" After 9/11, the original series' \\"broad premise ‚Äì the human military's struggles in the wake of a massive terrorist attack ‚Äì suddenly gained resonance\\" and let the show tackle issues like suicide bombings, torture (\\"evoking the darker side of the war on terror\\") and \\"civil liberties crackdowns\\". Executive producer Ronald D. Moore points out that the Cylons and Al Qaeda are not necessarily intended to be allegorical: \\"They have aspects of Al Qaeda and they have aspects of the Catholic Church and they have aspects of America.\\" On the other hand, abortion is illegal throughout the fleet, because the survival of what remains of humanity is at stake. In contrast, with the New Caprica storyline the show's humans have been discussed as an allegory not for an America under attack but for an occupied people mounting an insurgency and turning to suicide bombings as a tactic. There is a consensus that with \\"its third season, the show has morphed into a stinging allegorical critique of America's three-year occupation of Iraq\\" as the \\"cameras record Cylon occupation raids on unsuspecting human civilians with the night-vision green familiar to any TV news viewer. The reasoning of the Cylons is horrifically familiar, they would prefer not to be brutal but they won't accept the failure of a glorious mission.\\" According to Slate \\"If this sounds like Iraq, it should\\", and \\"In unmistakable terms, Battlestar Galactica is telling viewers that insurgency (like, say, the one in Iraq) might have some moral flaws, such as the whole suicide bombing thing, but is ultimately virtuous and worthy of support.\\" The \\"really audacious stroke of this season was showing us a story about a suicide bomber from the point of view of the bomber and his comrades... because the cause of this terrorist was unquestioningly our own. We sympathize with the insurgents wholeheartedly.\\" If the Cylon occupying force is an allegory of the Coalition Forces in Iraq, then some of the other references are equally controversial; the \\"scene of the shiny, terrifying Cylon centurions (a servant class of robots that actually look like robots) marching down the main road of New Caprica while the devastated colonists looked on was the Nazis marching into Paris.\\" Although David Eick has said the production staff \\"don't need to say 'OK, let's do the episode where we're gonna do the Abu Ghraib scandal'\\" and points out that events depicted on New Caprica \\"are as much a story rooted in political tales like the Vichy France or Vietnam\\" rather than current events, he acknowledges that they \\"do gravitate in those directions when it comes to the storytelling\\".  Music  The opening theme is a new-age- inflected version of the Gayatri Mantra, a Hindu hymn dedicated to the solar deity Savitr. Bear McCreary was the primary composer for the television series, having assisted Richard Gibbs on the 3-hour miniseries. When the show was picked up, Gibbs opted not to devote full-time to the regular series' production and McCreary became the composer. He scored over 70 episodes. Six Battlestar Galactica soundtrack albums have been released to great critical acclaim - one for the miniseries, one for each of the four seasons, and one combining music from the inter-season Razor and post-finale prequel The Plan. The Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan hailed the music as \\"sensational\\" and \\"innovative\\", Joanna Weiss of The Boston Globe praised McCreary as a \\"visionary composer\\" who did much to create \\"the rich atmosphere of Battlestar\\", Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger described McCreary's work on the show as \\"transcendent\\" and Variety said \\"Galactica offers some of the most innovative music on TV today.\\" The music of Battlestar Galactica displays a wide variety of ethnic influences and intentionally tries to avoid the \\"usual\\" style of a science fiction score. For some of the series' more important episodes, McCreary was granted a full orchestra. Character themes and leitmotifs gradually took on importance, despite being avoided earlier. A variety of ethnic instruments have been used. One season 4 episode employed: Chinese membrane flute, Indian bansuri flute, duduk (Armenian woodwind), erhu (Chinese violin), yialli tanbur (a Turkish lute), dumbek (Middle Eastern drum), Japanese taiko drums and four brass players, 30 string players and a 12-voice choir. There have been several live concerts featuring the music of Battlestar Galactica. In April 2008, more than 1,000 fans attended two sold- out shows at L.A.'s Roxy on Sunset Boulevard, with some fans flying in from as far as England and Australia. A ballet based on McCreary's scores for Galactica premiered on March 7, 2009 for a 13-week run. Entitled \\"Prelude to War\\", it was performed by the dancers of the Theaterhagen in Hagen, Germany with choreography by Ricardo Fernando, and the Hagen Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Bernhard Steiner.  Broadcast and release  The first season originally premiered in the United Kingdom, on October 18, 2004, on Sky1. Season 1 began airing in North America three months later, on January 14, 2005 in the United States, and January 15 in Canada. The first episode aired in the U.S. became one of the highest-rated programs ever on Sci-Fi, with 3.1 million viewers. Subsequent episodes proved equally successful. The first episode of the season was later made available for viewing in its entirety, and without charge from the Sci-Fi website. Moore also sought to address the \\"Internet Generation\\" by posting podcast commentaries on individual episodes on the official Sci-Fi website. Following the success of the 13-episode first season, the Sci-Fi Channel ordered a 20-episode second season on February 23, 2005. The season premiered in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel on July 15, 2005, with the UK, Ireland, and Canadian premiere in January 2006. In fall 2005, airing of the second season halted, as it was part of Sci-Fi Channel's standard airing schedule normally used for its Stargate series, which was to split a 20-episode season into two parts (a \\"winter season\\" and a \\"summer season\\") to avoid heavy competition with major networks that follow a spring/fall schedule. The second half of season 2 (\\"Season 2.5\\") began airing on January 6, 2006, after a three-month hiatus. The Sci-Fi Channel ordered a 20-episode third season on November 16, 2005, with production beginning in April 2006 in Vancouver, British Columbia. The season premiered in the United States on October 6, 2006, in Canada the following day, and in the UK on January 9, 2007; with the first two episodes being shown together. The broadcast schedule for season 3 did not include a long hiatus in the middle of the season, as with season 2. The Sci-Fi Channel moved the series to Sundays on January 21, 2007, the first time the show had changed nights since it began airing. Season 3 was broadcast in high-definition on Sky 1 HD in the UK and Ireland, starting on January 9, 2007, and in the U.S. on Universal HD, starting on January 27, 2007. The Sci-Fi Channel confirmed on May 31, 2007 that Battlestar Galactica had been renewed for a fourth season of 22 episodes, which producers David Eick and Ronald D. Moore later announced to be the series' last. Preceding this was the airing of the Razor TV movie (comprising two of the ordered broadcast hours), while the remaining season of 20 episodes was split into two halves, due to the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike. The first half comprised episodes 3 to 10, while the second half comprised episodes 11 to 22. The series finale aired on March 20, 2009. The first two slots of season 4's 22-episode order were taken up by the two-hour TV movie Razor, which was broadcast as an unbroken extended episode detailing the chronicles of the Battlestar Pegasus. It premiered November 24, 2007 in the U.S. and December 18, 2007 in the UK, with a limited U.S. theatrical engagement in major cities, and an extended version was released on DVD the following week. Razor had Michelle Forbes reprise her role as Helena Cain, and co-starred Australian actress Stephanie Chaves-Jacobsen, who played Kendra Shaw. The first half of season 4 (dubbed \\"Season 4.0\\" in its DVD release) consisted of ten episodes, and premiered April 4, 2008. The Canadian cable channel Space aired season 4 on the same dates. In the UK, Sky1 began airing season 4 on April 15, showing the first two episodes on that date, placing the UK four days behind the U.S. airing. The first part of season 4 began broadcast on Universal HD on August 30, 2008. In Australia, the first half of season 4 began screening on Ten HD on September 4, 2008, beginning with Razor. Linking both halves of season 4 together was a set of ten webisodes, which played a similar role to that which The Resistance played between seasons 2 and 3. Battlestar Galactica: The Face of the Enemy was released during the weeks leading up to the premiere of episode 13, starting on December 12, 2008, and ending on January 12, 2009. The second half of season 4 (dubbed \\"Season 4.5\\", and marketed in the UK as \\"the Final Season\\") consisted of ten episodes, and began airing on January 16, 2009. The season (and series) finale was split into two episodes in the U.S., with the normal-length first part airing on March 13, and the second, with a runtime (including advertisements) of two hours and eleven minutes, airing March 20. In Australia, the second half of season 4 premiered on the Australian Sci-Fi Channel on Foxtel January 31, and continued on a weekly basis with each of the remaining episodes of the series airing about six hours after the U.S. broadcast, until the final episode on March 21. = Continuation = On April 27, 2006, the Sci Fi Channel announced that a prequel spin-off of BSG was in development. Caprica takes place more than 50 years before the main series, before the original Cylon War, and chronicles the Adama family and Caprican society as well as shows the advancement of technology leading to the Cylon revolt. On March 18, 2008, Ronald Moore, the head writer, confirmed that Caprica would in fact be produced beginning with a two-hour backdoor pilot. On December 2, 2008 SCI FI announced that it had approved the full series. The first season, composed of 20 episodes including the pilot, premiered on January 22, 2010. An uncut version of the pilot was released on DVD on April 21, 2009, prior to the series' broadcast debut. On July 24, 2009, Edward James Olmos suggested that The Plan would not be the last BSG movie, saying that he had written a script involving the Galactica characters in which a crisis occurs at some point after their arrival on Earth. On March 15, 2010, Syfy executive Mark Stern said that Syfy was working with Ronald D. Moore to develop a second spinoff of Battlestar Galactica, which would \\"mark a return to the franchise's space- opera roots\\" and \\"not necessarily be a traditional series.\\" On July 27, 2010, it was revealed that the series would be called Blood & Chrome, featuring William Adama during the First Cylon War, and written by Michael Taylor. The series was distributed as a 10-episode online series on Machinima.com starting November 9, 2012, and aired as a televised movie on February 10, 2013 on Syfy. =Home media= The miniseries was released in the region 2 on March 1, 2004 and in region 1 on December 28, 2004, and included deleted scenes, audio commentary, and a behind-the-scenes documentary. The first season was released to DVD on March 28, 2005 and September 20, 2005 in region 2 and region 1 respectively and included deleted scenes. The region 1 set also included featurettes, and a tongue-in-cheek promotional special filmed for the Sci Fi Channel in addition to the miniseries. However, it does not contain the special features that were included on the miniseries stand alone DVD release. The second season was released in its entirety in a single volume in regions 2 and 4, but issued in two separate volumes (dubbed \\"Season 2.0\\" and \\"Season 2.5\\") in the region 1, which corresponded with the mid-season break in the broadcast schedule. Each region 1 volume contains half of the season, along with deleted scenes and podcasts that were previously available on the official website. \\"Season 2.5\\" also contains an extended version of \\"Pegasus\\", the last episode of the first half of the season. The region 2 DVDs include the extended version of \\"Pegasus\\", as well as the commentaries and deleted scenes from the region 1 \\"2.0\\" release, but do not contain any of the commentaries and deleted scenes from the \\"2.5\\" release (other than the extended \\"Pegasus\\" episode), nor the original, shorter version of \\"Pegasus\\" included on the region 1 \\"2.0\\" release. The Canadian DVD release of \\"Season 2.0\\" was delayed until April 25, 2006, as the episodes had only begun airing in January 2006. The third season was released in region 1 on March 18, 2008, in region 2 on September 3, 2007 and in region 4 on November 20, 2007. The region 2 and 4 DVDs do not contain any extras but region 2's box set comes with a 45-minute recap of the previous two seasons (consisting of clips of the seasons strung together with a voice-over). The fourth season, like season 2, was released in two parts. In regions 1, 2 and 4, the television movie Razor is included in \\"Season 4.0\\" (as it is technically a part of the season despite it being released separately at an earlier date). In region 1, however, both the extended and shortened versions of Razor are included in the \\"4.0\\" box set. On August 14, 2007, Universal Studios Home Entertainment announced that the miniseries and season 1 would be released on December 4, 2007, in region 1, on the now discontinued high definition disc format HD DVD. The technical specifications include 1080p/VC-1 transfers of the miniseries and each episode is in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio, plus Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround sound and Dolby Digital-Plus 5.1 surround audio options. Each individual season has also subsequently been released on Blu-ray Disc. The complete series set was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 28, 2009, in limited edition packaging and with a Cylon Centurion figurine in certain territories. It was re-released on April 6, 2010 in new packaging, with the Region 1 re-release now including The Plan TV movie (this was not included in the Region 2 release).  Influence  = Critical response = Throughout its run, the series earned critical acclaim from Time, National Review, Rolling Stone, Newsday, The New York Times, The New Yorker, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Chicago Tribune, and Entertainment Weekly. Diane Werts of Newsday wrote: \\"You can look at this saga any way you want‚Äîas political drama, religious debate, psychological suspenser, sci-fi adventure, deep metaphor or just plain fun‚Äîand it's scintillating from every angle.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today commented: \\"Driven by violence and rage, Galactica is perhaps the darkest space opera American TV has ever produced. In Galactica's future, humans are on the run, and if external enemies don't get us, internal divisions will... You'll understand them [the characters], their conflicts and their desires, because they're recognizable humans in all their glorious complexity. And that's what makes Galactica a great TV series.\\" Peter Suderman of National Review stated that the series is \\"arguably the most potent, dramatically vibrant series on television. ...[I]t packs the power of a gut punch on screen. For that, much credit is due to the immensely compelling cast of characters... Battlestar Galactica burns with a combustive mixture of political turmoil and human drama that is as achingly real and relevant as anything on television. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the show \\"has distinguished itself as one of television's very best dramas ‚Äî on a par with 24, The Wire, and Lost ‚Äî because it so utterly transcends both its genre and its source material. ...[The] series' sophisticated stories have also attracted a distinctively new breed of fan, one who's not necessarily a sci-fi buff.\\" Moreover, in 2012, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at #7 in the \\"25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years,\\" saying that producer Moore \\"expanded the show's central premise into an addictive post-9/11 parable and one of the most critically acclaimed series of the decade.\\" The article credited Starbuck and Number Six as \\"geek and feminist icons,\\" adding, \\"best of all, the show introduced this peerless profanity into the national lexicon: Frak!\\"\\"25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years.\\" Entertainment Weekly. August 3, 2012, p. 40. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times praised the show's ability to \\"anchor fantasy with vivid and recognizable human psychology\\" and declares that the series is \\"not just a cult hit but a significant piece of television.\\" Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune described it as a \\"sprawling, enthralling tale of human survival\\" that is \\"full of political allegories and fascinating, multifaceted characters.\\" She finds, \\"Like Deadwood, Battlestar Galactica is interested in exploring how a society on the edge decides to govern itself. What rights and actions are sacrosanct, which are outlawed, when most of the human race is eliminated? ... Thanks to a stellar cast and brave writing, Battlestar soars.\\" Throughout its run, the series has often surprised reviewers with its many twists and turns. Ryan comments: \\"There's nothing like a good Battlestar plot twist to make your head spin, but the 'holy cow' moments aren't the main point (though they're one heck of a tasty side dish). The show and its twists and turns are grounded in deep curiosity about human nature, and how contradictory and confounding it can be.\\" Matt Soergel of The Florida Times-Union stated: \\"Its propulsive and complex storytelling is matched by, at best, just a handful of theatrical movies a year.\\" Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle opines, \\"Battlestar Galactica transcends the sci-fi genre; it competes, creatively, on the same level as any other top-tier drama.\\" Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald stated: \\"A drama this gripping comes 'round rarely.\\" James Poniewozik of Time Magazine named it one of the 100 best TV shows of all time. Time magazine also wrote in the spring of 2005 that the new show was one of the six best drama programs on television. It would proclaim the program the best show on television in December of the same year. Television Without Pity described Battlestar Galactica as \\"one of the finest, most beautifully written, expertly acted shows on television.\\" Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote: \\"[W]hat makes Galactica so gripping is its emphasis on character over hardware. The explosions and the killer robots are cool, but they don't stack up to seeing drawn people - brought to life by a great writing staff led by producer Ron Moore and an astonishing cast led by Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell - grapple with these life-or-death, genocide-level decisions.\\" Joshua Alston of Newsweek declares that the show \\"captures better than any other TV drama of the past eight years the fear, uncertainty and moral ambiguity of the post-9/11 world\\" and \\"always finds ways to challenge the audience's beliefs.\\" It has also been named the best science fiction series by IGN.com and Boston.com. The series placed #59 on Entertainment Weekly \\"New TV Classics\\" list. Empire ranked it #6 on its list of the 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2013 TV Guide included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All TimeRoush, Matt (February 25, 2013). \\"Showstoppers: The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time\\". TV Guide. pp. 16-17. and ranked it as the #3 sci-fi show and the #57 best series of all time. Also in 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it 38th on their list of the 101 Best-Written TV Series of All Time. The series also draws praise for having many strong and complex female characters. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's Melanie McFarland notes, \\"[Starbuck], played with a tomboyish swagger by Katee Sackhoff, is fast becoming the latest in a long line of feminist television icons.\\" The series has also received favorable reviews from other writers. Stephen King wrote, \\"This is a beautifully written show, driven by character rather than effects...but the effects are damn good. And there's not a better acting troupe at work on television.\\" Joss Whedon commented: \\"I think it's so passionate, textured, complex, subversive and challenging that it dwarfs everything on TV.\\" Some fans of the original 1970s series opposed the re- imagined series since the time it premiered, due to what was perceived as its darker, more confused tone. In a May 2004 article from Dreamwatch magazine titled \\"Starbuck: Lost in Castration\\", Dirk Benedict, who portrayed Lieutenant Starbuck in the original series, harshly criticized the re-imagined series, citing its dark tone and supposed moral relativism. Benedict devoted the greatest part of the article to criticizing the producers' decision to turn Starbuck into a female character, tying it in to what he perceived as a general anti-masculinity agenda. Other critics, even those who wrote rave reviews about the first two seasons of the series, felt that a major drop in quality occurred in the third season, continuing into the fourth and final season. In particular, the controversial series finale drew heavy criticism, largely due to the view that it failed to explain many of the main plotlines which had been teased throughout the series' run. Charlie Jane Anders of io9.com wrote: Anders later included the series in her list of \\"10 Once-Great TV Shows (And The Exact Moments They Started to Suck)\\", saying: In a Commentary article on the prevalence of Bush Derangement Syndrome in popular culture, Jonah Goldberg analyzed the show's \\"radically bizarre and nonsensical turn of events ... that led inexorably to its self-destruction\\": Fantasy author George R.R. Martin expressed his dissatisfaction with how the writers handled the ending of the TV series, commenting: Josh Tyler of Blend Magazine concluded that the series finale made no real attempt to resolve any of the plotlines or mysteries set up during the earlier run of the show. = Wider influence = On March 17, 2009, the United Nations hosted a Battlestar Galactica retrospective including a discussion with Mary McDonnell, Edward James Olmos, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick on human rights, terrorism, children and armed conflict, and reconciliation between civilians and faiths. The Discussion was moderated by actress Whoopi Goldberg and also included Radhika Coomaraswamy, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict; Craig Mokhiber of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; Robert C. Orr, Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Planning; and Famatta Rose Osode, from the Permanent Mission of Liberia to the UN.

However, his motives were not mercenary, as he fought only for Presbyterian principles or causes. Biography He was born in Glasgow, the son of Hugh Crawford of Kilbirnie and from a fairly early age served in the armies of Christian IV of Denmark, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine. Having travelled to England in the suite of Charles Louis, in 1641 Crawford was appointed Colonel of a regiment of foot which was to serve in Ireland in the army of the Earl of Ormonde to put down the Irish Rebellion of 1641. From 1641 to 1643, Crawford remained in Ireland, although the English Civil War had broken out in England. In 1643, Ormonde agreed to a \\"cessation\\", or a truce with the rebel Irish Catholic Confederation, and to send troops to England to support the Royalists fighting for King Charles I. Crawford refused to serve with these troops, against the Presbyterian Covenanters. Ormonde had him arrested, but he escaped and made his way to England. He was appointed by Parliament to be Sergeant Major General of Foot in the Parliamentarian Army of the Eastern Association, raised in the eastern counties of England. He almost immediately clashed with the army's Lieutenant General, Oliver Cromwell, over the appointment of Independents as officers. Parliament's agreement with the Scottish Covenanters, by which Presbyterianism was to be made the established religion of both countries meant that Crawford was legally in the right, but neither General would give way. The army's commander, the Earl of Manchester supported Crawford and the official position. In 1644, Manchester's army took part in the Siege of York. Crawford exploded a mine beneath a tower forming part of the city walls, but had insufficient troops on hand to storm the city through the breach. His men were driven back with heavy casualties. Crawford attracted some censure for this. It is possible that he believed that the mine was about to be flooded by the defenders, and decided to fire it rather than lose it ignominiously. On 2 July, after York was relieved by Prince Rupert of the Rhine, the Battle of Marston Moor was fought. Crawford's foot regiments provided invaluable support to Cromwell's cavalry, who largely won the battle. Some of Cromwell's opponents in Parliament alleged that Crawford had commanded Cromwell's troopers while Cromwell was having a wound attended to, or in a state of panic. There was never any evidence for this apart from malicious second-hand gossip. The victory brought no peace between the two generals. Cromwell demanded that Crawford be dismissed, but withdrew the demand on the grounds of military necessity. When Cromwell demanded an inquiry into the conduct of Manchester after the Second Battle of Newbury, Crawford supported Manchester before the House of Commons. When Parliament created the New Model Army, Crawford was offered command of one of its regiments of foot, but refused to serve in what he regarded as an army of Independents. Instead, he served in the smaller army of the \\"Western Association\\" under Edward Massey. He was killed in August 1645, at the siege of Hereford by a Royalist sniper.

Early naturalists have suggested its resemblance to the venomous common krait as an instance of Batesian mimicry. Description The colouration of this snake is variable. Lycodon aulicus (Common Wolf Snake ) This snake is often confused with the common krait. The presence of a loreal shield can be used to distinguish it from kraits. The following is a description of various forms from Albert G√ºnther's Reptiles of British India (1864). left Snout broad, much depressed, long, spatulate, with the upper lip swollen, and without canthus rostralis. Rostral shield very low, broad, slightly bent backwards on the upper surface of the snout; anterior frontals [= internasals] very small; posterior frontals [= prefrontals] longer than broad, much more so in adult specimens than in young ones; there is a lateral notch between the anterior and posterior frontals, in which the inner anterior angle of the loreal is received; the posterior frontals have an obtuse lateral angle corresponding to the suture between loreal and praeocular; occipitals elongate. Nostril small, directed upwards, between two nasals, the anterior of which is situated on the foremost part of the snout. Loreal single, large, nearly twice as long as broad. Praeocular single, in contact with the vertical [= frontal] and with the third labial; specimens in which it does not reach the vertical are very scarce. Two postoculars; supraciliary rather small. Nine upper labials, the third, fourth, and fifth of which enter the orbit. Temporals numerous, scale-like. Scales smooth, with a minute apical groove, in seventeen rows. Abdomen and tail with an angular ridge on each side. Ventrals 183-209; anal bifid, in a few specimens entire; subcaudals 57-77. Each maxillary is armed with two fangs in front, placed in a transverse line, the outer being much larger than the inner; the lateral longitudinal series of teeth commences at some distance from the fangs; they are small, from four to twelve in number, the last being considerably larger than the others; pterygoido-palatine teeth small, of equal size; mandible with two or three fangs on each side and with a series of small teeth. Coloration variable. *I. Continental varieties. The posterior frontals are moderately elongate-in young specimens nearly as broad as long. Each upper labial with a brown spot. [To this category belong also specimens from the Philippine Islands.] ** Var. a. Uniform brown above, without collar: Malayan peninsula, Bengal, Madras. ** Var. b. Uniform brown above, with a while collar: Madras. ** Var. c. Brown or greyish brown, With indistinct traces of a white network, and with a white collar, more distinct in young specimens than in old ones: Coast of Malabar, Pinang, Malayan peninsula, Gamboja, Philippine Islands, Timor. ** Var. d. Ferruginous or chestnut-brown, with white, brown- edged cross bars on the back, which are sometimes bifid on the sides, the branches of one band joining a branch of the preceding and following bands. The first band forms a collar; those on the hind part of the body gradually become indistinct. This variety is very common, and similar to, but specifically distinct from, the snake figured by Russell (i. pl. 16): we have received it from Pinang, Bengal, Nepal, Kangra (Himalayas), the Dekkan, and the Anamallay Mountains. * II. Ceylonese varieties. The posterior frontals are much elongate, much longer than broad in every age. Upper labials while or shaded with brown. ** Var. e. Uniform brownish grey above. ** Var. f. Brown, with three or four broad, distant, white cross bands on the anterior half of the body; the anterior forms a collar, the others being broadest on the sides. ** Var. g. Brown or greyish, with pure-while or reticulated while cross bands extending downwards to the belly, where they are broadest. A south Indian specimen Another south Indian specimen (melanistic) from Sholayar reserve forests, Kerala. The following description is from Boulenger's Fauna of British India, Reptilia and Batrachia volume (1890): left Snout much depressed, with swollen lips, spatulate in the adult; eye rather small. Rostral much broader than long, just visible from above: internasals much shorter than the prefrontals; frontal usually shorter than its distance from the end of the snout or than the parietals ; loreal elongate, not entering the eye; one praeocular, usually in contact with the frontal; two postoculars; temporals small, scale-like, 2+3 or 3+3; 9 upper labials, third, fourth, and fifth entering the eye; 4 or 5 lower labials in contact with the anterior chin-shields, which are longer than the posterior. Scales smooth, in 17 rows. Ventrals 183-209, obtusely angulate laterally; anal divided; subcaudals 57-77, in two rows. Coloration variable; uniform brown above, or with white transverse bands, or with white reticulation; upper lip uniform white, or with brown spots; lower parts uniform white. Total length 71 cm (28 inches); tail 11 cm (4¬º inches).Boulenger, G.A. 1893. Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History), Volume I. London. Habitat: India and Ceylon, Himalayas, Burma, Siam, Malay Peninsula, Java, Philippines, Timor. A common snake in India. Scalation The rostral touches six shields. The frontal touches the parietals, supraoculars, prefrontals and preoculars. The supraoculars are small. The parietals are one and a half times the size of the frontal. The preoculars are entire, while the postoculars and temporals are divided into two shields. There are nine supralabials, with the 3rd, 4th, and 5th touching the eye. The ventrals are 170 to 224 in number. The anal shield is divided. The subcaudals are 56 to 80 and are divided. Distribution Lycodon aulicus is found in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India (north to Himalayas and Assam; Maharashtra), Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar (= Burma), Thailand (incl. Phuket), W Malaysia, Indonesia (southward as far as Timor), Philippines, Seychelles, The Maldives (accidental introduction), Mascarenes, Mauritius (introduced), S China (from Fujian and Guangdong westward to Yunnan, incl. Hong Kong). It is one of the most common snakes of India and Ceylon, but becomes scarcer on the coasts of the southeastern parts of India. It occurs on only a few of the islands in the Philippines. Behaviour The Indian wolf snake is nocturnal and is inactive in the day. It is of fierce habits and defends itself vigorously, however it is nonvenomous. It is known to defend itself when barred of escape, and can cause severe lacerations with its fine sharp \\"fangs\\". It may also feign death to lure in potential prey and to avoid being chased by predators. Diet Lycodon aulicus feeds on lizards and frogs. According to G√ºnther (1864) it is one of the most formidable enemies of the skinks, which form almost its sole food, the \\"fangs\\" in the front of its jaws being adapted for piercing and making good its hold on the hard smooth scales with which those lizards are coated. Reproduction Females may be larger than males. They breed prior to the monsoons and lay 4-11 eggs. The eggs hatch in September or October, and the hatchlings are 14‚Äì19 cm (5¬Ω-7‚Öú inches) long.Das, I. 2002. A Photographic Guide to Snakes and Other Reptiles of India Ralph Curtis Books.

Named after their enlarged front teeth, which gives them a muzzled appearance similar to canines, it also makes the snout somewhat more squarish than other snakes. Description Lycodon capucinus from Pranburi Forest Park, Thailand. A slender-bodied small snake that ranges from barely three feet to less than one meter. Most wild-caught specimens usually reach less than these lengths. Coloration is adapted for life underground and on the forest floor. Shades of jet black, reddish-brown or dark gray with speckles, blotches and spots of white or pale yellow scattered over the body are its usual colors. There is also a distinct white coloration around its neck. Their color patterns vary from one geographic location to another. There are albino-colored ones which are very rare among this snake species. The snout is duck-bill-shaped for digging in soft or sandy ground. They have enlarged front teeth, but these are not used to inject venom. Like many other colubrids, they possess true fangs near the rear of their mouths and they will use these to inject venom into their prey. However, this species is relatively benign (not harmful) to humans. Distribution The common wolf snake is found in (Cook Islands), Myanmar, Nepal, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Laos, SE China, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, India (Andaman Islands, Assam), Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sumbawa, Sumba, Komodo, Flores, Lomblen, Alor, Sawu, Roti, Timor, Wetar, Babar Islands, Kalao, Salajar, Buton, Sulawesi), West Malaysia, Johor: Pulau Besar, Maldives, Mascarenes (Mauritius, Reunion; fide Glaw, pers. comm.), and The Philippines (Bantayan, Bohol, Cebu, Cuyo, Leyte, Luzon, Pampanga, Masbate, Mindanao, Mindoro, Negros, Palawan, Panay, Samar). 200px Behavior Though the wolf snake is non-venomous, it is quite a nervous snake when picked up or handled and will not hesitate to bite. They may also move their tails in a to- and-fro motion much like a rattlesnake when they feel threatened. A fossorial animal, it loves burrowing down the earth but is most often found in open ground, on rocks or in low vegetation. Sometimes showing a semi-arboreal behavior. A nocturnal creature, it is most active during the night, but is also observed during daybreak. Most captive specimens become tame after some time and with proper handling. Diet In the wild, Lycodon capucinus feeds mainly on small lizards such as geckos and they are also among the top predators of skinks which makes it common to humans due to the abundance of prey near and in homes. They may also devour small frogs, if available. In captivity, they may be trained to feed on slender fishes such as goby or lizard-scented pinkie mice, though the latter proves to be harder. Conservation status The IUCN listed this species as of 'Least Concern.' Though a very common snake, it is seldom seen. Continuous destruction of primary and secondary forests, conversion of fertile lands to agricultural and residential areas as well as indiscriminate human killings can threaten the survival of this animal. It is endangered in numerous parts of mainland Asia and peninsular Southeast Asia.

He has been called \\"Los Angeles' greatest and most controversial chief of police\\". He was the longest-serving police chief at 39 years on the force. The former headquarters of the LAPD, the Parker Center, was named after him. Early years Parker was born in Lead, South Dakota, and raised in Deadwood. His grandfather William H. Parker (1847-1908), was an American Civil War veteran who later served in Congress. The Parker family migrated to Los Angeles, California, in 1922, for better opportunities, when the city was advertised as the \\"white spot of America\\" during that period. Despite this advertisement, the Parker family were in a clear minority in the distinctly White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Los Angeles, due to their Catholic religion. Parker originally wanted to be an attorney, and studied at several colleges before enrolling in 1926 at the University of the West's Los Angeles College of Law, an institution which operated in the 1920s and '30s. He joined the LAPD on August 8, 1927, and continued his legal studies. Parker graduated with an LL.B. degree in 1930 and passed the bar exam, but opted to continue with the police department instead of practicing law.http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/12050 During Parker's early years in the department, he was an active advocate for the police and fire fighter's union, working to create job security and better wages for members of the police and fire departments. He served as an LAPD officer for 15 years before taking a leave to fight in World War II. He attained the rank of captain as a planner and organizer of prisoner detention and policing in Sardinia, Normandy, Munich, and Frankfurt. Parker received the Purple Heart for injuries he received when a column he was in was strafed five days after the Normandy invasion. Shortly after the war, the French government awarded him the Croix de Guerre with silver star for his service in the war maintaining order after the liberation of Paris. After the war, Parker returned to the police department and rose through the ranks to captain, then inspector, and then one of the department's deputy chiefs. Parker as chief Parker became police chief on August 9, 1950, and is credited with transforming the LAPD into a world-renowned law-enforcement agency. The department that he took over in 1950 was notoriously corrupt. Seeing ward politics, with its heavy involvement by partisan groups in the police department and mingling of political circles with vice and corruption on the streets, led him to conclude that a differently organized police force was necessary to keep the peace. Under Parker's early term, the LAPD initiated a more professionalized force which institutionalized officers into an environment that was more answerable to administrative oversight than political representatives. At the same time, Parker's reforms gave the chief unprecedented autonomy compared to the police chiefs of other major cities and would be an obstacle to attempted reforms from future L.A. mayors later in his career. Included in this change was a standardized police academy and more proactive policing methods, practices very similar to military peacekeeping methods to which he was exposed during the war. Although Parker had a low opinion of Hollywood and the way they portrayed the police, he realized what an effective tool the new medium of television could be to promote his view of the role law enforcement in general and the LAPD in particular played in maintaining order and civilized behavior. He first helped produce a panel show related to the LAPD called The Thin Blue Line. The phrase \\"thin blue line\\" came from a battle in the Crimean War where a small \\"line\\" of British infantry defeated a much larger charge of Russian cavalry and came to be a common phrase to refer to the police as the line between civil society and criminality. Parker is sometimes credited for coining the phrase but others contest this. In addition to helping produce the show, Parker was a frequent panel member. Much more influential was his support for the radio and then television program Dragnet developed by Jack Webb. Unlike virtually all previous crime dramas, Dragnet attempted to show police procedure as it actually happened. Parker gave Webb access to police files and allowed him to observe the LAPD in action even to the point of recording the sounds of police cars rapidly leaving the garage. While accuracy was a major goal of Dragnet, Webb (with Parker's approval) was a strong advocate of the LAPD and always stayed away from any story that showed any measure of police incompetence or corruption. Parker was also a guest on the television program What's My Line? on August 21, 1955. Another aspect of changes initiated by Parker which changed the police force from one of a walking peace-force to a more militarized mobile response force was a reduction in the size of the police force in relation to the population. Parker's experience with the numerically larger force of his early career led him to judge that fewer but more professional officers would mean less corruption. Additionally, the strategy of changing the beat posture to one of mobility led to change from foot patrols to one which favored police cars. Not incidentally, this also furthered Parker's belief that isolating his officers from the streets would reduce opportunities for corruption. However, Parker recognized that certain areas of the city and certain functions of the police department needed to remain rooted in the more traditional form of police work. Although Parker reduced police corruption and cleaned up the overall image of the police, certain sections of the LAPD continued practices which lent more to an image of old semicorrupt control of vice and petty crime. The vice squad and reserve force continued to remain controversial elements of the police force. Parker also used elements of the reserve force such as the Organized Crime and Intelligence Division of the LAPD to keep tabs on suspected politicians and their mafia syndicate allies, as well as the notoriously corrupt and narcotic- ridden Hollywood movie industry and its celebrities. The 1990 novel and 1997 film L.A. Confidential along with the 2013 film Gangster Squad, provide fictional depictions of the LAPD under Parker during these years. Under Parker, the LAPD faced accusations of police brutality and racism towards the city's African American and Latino residents. According to a documentary commissioned by the LAPD in 2009, Parker supported the city's power structure, which he denied was racist as late as the 1960s.https://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/21/opinion/oe-rutten21 Some critics see Parker's policies as responsible for ongoing tensions between the LAPD and minorities. Although Parker testified to the Civil Rights Commission in 1959 that segregation was not a problem, in 1962, he ordered the desegregation of the LAPD.http://www.laweekly.com/news/the-bum-blockade-zoot- suit-riot-and-bloody-christmas-2135303 When asked by the Commission about discrimination against minorities, he replied \\"I think the greatest dislocated minority in America today are the police.\\" Parker was also known to publicly make callous and racist remarks towards minorities, African-Americans especially. He largely refused to hire Black police officers. During most of his tenure, those already on the force were prohibited from having white partners. Perpetrators of white supremacist violence were never brought to justice under his tenure. Parker's controversial practices towards minorities have been cited as the cause of the 1965 Watts riots on August 11, 1965. For five days, businesses and stores were burned or looted, civilians were killed or wounded while being caught in the crossfire, and sniping was frequent, before the rioters finally dispersed from committing more violence after the California Army National Guard took to the streets in supplementing the over- worked LAPD officers. At the end, 34 people were killed in the riots, 21 of them by police or National Guard bullets. About 1,032 were injured, 3,438 were arrested, and over $40 million in property damage were caused. In spite of this, this was not enough to derail Parker's career, as he continued to serve as LAPD Police Chief for another year prior to his death. In a 1992 article in the Los Angeles Times by David Shaw, he writes: \\"When Parker referred to black participants in the Watts riots as behaving like 'monkeys in a zoo,' a Times story later charitably characterized this as an 'obviously unintentional but unfortunate remark.' During the riots, Parker also said, on television: 'It is estimated that by 1970, 45% of the metropolitan area of Los Angeles will be Negro...If you want any protection for your home and family...you‚Äôre going to have to get in and support a strong Police Department. If you don‚Äôt, come 1970, God help you.' Earlier in his tenure, Parker attributed criminal activity among Latinos to their 'not being too far removed from the wild tribes of...the inner mountains of Mexico.'\\" Death Parker died of a heart attack on July 16, 1966, after attending a dinner where he received a commendation.http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1110 Completed under Parker's tenure in 1955, the former Police Administration Building on Los Angeles Street was renamed Parker Center shortly after his death, and served as LAPD's headquarters until the new HQ was completed in 2009.http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1123 Now being demolished, Parker Center lives on in popular media, with frequent appearances and mentions in the classic TV series Dragnet, Perry Mason, Columbo, and in the films, Blue Thunder and Inherent Vice.

The longest adult known to George Albert Boulenger in 1893 was in total length, with a tail long.Boulenger, G. A. 1893. Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History), Volume I., Containing the Families...Colubrid√¶... Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History). London. pp. 349-350. The head is only slightly distinct from the neck, and the snout is flattened. There are 8 upper labials, the first and second contacting the nasal scale. Taxonomy Lycodon striatus was first described in 1802 by George Shaw, as Coluber striatus; its type locality was \\"Vizagapatam and Hyderabad\\". Three subspecies are recognised, including the nominate race: *Lycodon striatus bicolor (Nikolsky, 1903) ‚Äì Pakistan *Lycodon striatus sinhaleyus Deraniyagala, 1955 *Lycodon striatus striatus (Shaw, 1802) Ecology Lycodon striatus prefers dry regions such as semideserts and forest edges. Snakes of this species are nocturnal. By day they hide under stones, but after dark they emerge to hunt. Lycodon striatus feeds on skinks, geckos and other small lizards. Reproduction Adult females lay eggs in April (in India). Clutch size is small, at only 2‚Äì4 eggs, and the egg size is relatively large ‚Äì long by wide. Parental care of the eggs has been observed.

As he turns in his sleep, his Conscience takes a form of its own beside him. She looks exactly like Donald, but wears a white robe and a golden halo. She also has a kinder and gentler voice than Donald. The Conscience tries to get Donald up and out of bed so he won't be late for school, but Donald's Anti-Conscience appears to keep Donald in bed. He has a different voice than Donald's and has a devil form with horns. He easily convinces Donald to stay in bed, but the Conscience wins out and walks with Donald to school. Along the way, Donald is tempted by the Anti-Conscience to skip out on school and go fishing instead. At the fishing hole, the Anti-Conscience pressures him to smoke a pipe, which causes him to get sick. Soon the Conscience arrives looking for Donald. She finds him sick, and she gets angry at the Anti-Conscience for Donald's misfortune. The Anti-Conscience soon realizes he's in trouble when he sees the Conscience behind him. \\"YOU! This is all your fault!\\" says the Conscience to the Anti- Conscience, who nervously convinces the Conscience not to hurt him. The Conscience refuses, but after the Anti-Conscience deliberately tricks her, proceeds to fight the Anti-Conscience to teach him a lesson.

Williams (October 1, 1943 ‚Äì April 26, 2016) was the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) from 1992 to 1997, taking over after chief Daryl Gates' resignation following the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Williams was the first African-American police commissioner of both the Philadelphia Police Department and the LAPD. During his term as chief of the LAPD, he tried to create a positive image of the department and close the rift created between the police and black neighborhoods by the violent arrest of Rodney King in 1991. Philadelphia Police Chief (1988-1992) In June 1988, Philadelphia Police Chief Kevin M. Tucker resigned from the Philadelphia Police Department to become a senior vice president at PNC Bank. Willie Williams, who was described as a prot√©g√© of Tucker, was chosen to succeed him. Upon taking office, Williams became the first African American police commissioner in Philadelphia history. On July 31, 1990, Williams, as Philadelphia Police Commissioner, testified before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, 101st Congress, 2nd Session on \\"The Increase of Homicides In Our Nation\\" also known as \\"Murder Rates: Why The Recent Rise?\\" In his testimony, Williams stated in part: \\"We must prevent the ready availability of handguns in America. It is for this reason, that I fully support the 'Brady' legislation which would require a seven-day waiting period when purchasing a handgun. Currently, there is a three-day waiting period to purchase a handgun in Philadelphia and a two-day waiting period across the rest of Pennsylvania. \\"Furthermore, I support a total ban on the possession of handguns and semi- automatic weapons by members of the general public. Weapons such as these are not used as legitimate hunting weapons, unless we have lowered ourselves to prey upon human beings.\\" Los Angeles Police Chief (1992-1997) Williams was appointed as LAPD Chief, succeeding Daryl F. Gates. Williams, however, faced a difficult tenure as he was at odds with the members of the Los Angeles Police Commission appointed by newly elected mayor Richard Riordan. Williams had concerns about Riordan's pledge to add 3,000 officers, and instead lobbied for internal reforms recommended by the Christopher Commission in 1991.https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-willie-williams-chief- looks-back-20160427-story.html He was also not popular with the LAPD rank-and- file, particularly when he did not cut short his vacation in Las Vegas to attend an officer's funeral. However, Williams was the most popular official in Los Angeles and he was credited with restoring confidence in the department. Williams never took the POST exams required to become a peace officer in California. Not being POST certified, Williams as Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department could not make a felony arrest, and his provisional membership in the California Police Chiefs Association was terminated early in his tenure as Chief due to his lack of certification. The California legislature passed special legislation defining police chiefs as peace officers regardless of POST certification so Williams could carry a firearm.Daily News, Los Angeles, CA, August 2, 1996. In 1996, Williams published Taking Back Our Streets: Fighting Crime in America, co-written with Bruce Henderson. The book discusses Williams's philosophy of community policing and his efforts to revive and retrain a demoralized police force. In 1997, the Los Angeles Police Commission declined to renew his contract, citing Williams' failure to fulfill his mandate to create meaningful change in the department in the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. He was credited with strong public outreach, but faulted for management breakdowns. Williams threatened a lawsuit after city officials publicly questioned his honesty and management abilities. Under an agreement, he received $375,000 in severance in return for stepping down on May 17, seven weeks before his contract expired. In 2002, Williams was appointed federal security director for Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta by U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta.

He had fans across Sri Lanka and India. Vannakam Listeners liked his relaxed style and they recognised his voice instantly when he uttered one word ' Vannakam ' - in Tamil, it means ' Welcome.' His wife, Chenthimani Mylvaganam, was the first lady news reader at Radio Ceylon. It was through his wife that Mr Mylvaganam was introduced to announcing .He presented a range of Tamil programmes on the Commercial Service. He was trained by the Australian administrator Clifford Dodd who came to work for Radio Ceylon under the Colombo Plan and by Livy Wijemanne. Iconic status Mylvaganam belonged to that select band of announcers of Radio Ceylon who enjoyed iconic status in South Asia. Radio Ceylon, now the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, is the oldest radio station in the region. He helped popularise Radio Ceylon in India - millions tuned into the station. In a time where announcers arose above narrow racial barriers, Mylvaganam had close friendships with Sinhala announcers who worked on the English and Sinhala services. He worked very closely with Vernon Corea on radio programmes and they shared ideas together. Mylvaganam was popular right across South Asia. Involvement with Tamil Stars from India Mylvaganam was very involved with Tamil stars of the time such as Shivaji Ganeshan, MGR and other popular stars, such was his pulling power on the Indian sub-continent. He and his wife were the catalysts who brought MGR and Saroja Devi to Sri Lanka on his first visit in October 1965, to judge a beauty pageant in Kandy, sponsored by the Independent Newspapers Ltd. It still remains very vividly in many peoples memory the day MGR and Saroja Devi visited Mylvaganan's residence in Colombo. The railway tracks, the streets and the beach were spilling with crowds shouting and screaming to see MGR and Saroja Devi.

This depiction became less common as the doctrine of the Assumption gained support in the Roman Catholic Church from the Late Middle Ages onward. Although that doctrine avoids stating whether Mary was alive or dead when she was bodily taken up to Heaven, she is normally shown in art as alive. Nothing is said in the Bible about the end of Mary's life, but a tradition dating back to at least the 5th century says the twelve Apostles were miraculously assembled from their far-flung missionary activity to be present at the death, and that is the scene normally depicted, with the apostles gathered round the bed. A virtuoso engraving by Martin Schongauer of about 1470 shows the Virgin from the foot of a large bed with the apostles spread around the three sides, and this composition influences many later depictions. Earlier depictions usually follow the standard Byzantine image, with the Virgin lying on a bed or sarcophagus across the front of the picture space, with Christ usually standing above her on the far side, and the apostles and others gathered around. Often Christ holds a small figure that may look like a baby, representing Mary's soul. A prominent, and late, example of the subject is Death of the Virgin by Caravaggio (1606), the last major Catholic depiction. Other examples include Death of the Virgin by Andrea Mantegna and Death of the Virgin by Hugo van der Goes. All these show the gathering of the apostles around the deathbed, as does an etching by Rembrandt. Three minor anonymous artists are known to art history as the Master of the Death of the Virgin.

The original members were Mike Stand (vocals, songwriting, and guitar), Jeff Crandall (drums), Steve Pannier (guitars) and Ric Alba (bass, background vocals). Mark Robertson would later replace Alba on bass.  Background  The Altar Boys helped pioneer Christian rock music. They were known for their Ramones-style punk music which was radically different than the Christian music common at the time of their formation. Especially in their early years, they were known for being explicit with their faith in their lyrics. Their sound was heavily influenced by the punk rock scene in Southern California, and they quickly became one of the best known Christian bands on that scene. The Altar Boys' first album issued on various labels (e.g. Ministry Resource Center/MRC, Maranatha! Music, and Broken Records) sold over 7,000 copies with their second selling 20,000 units in its first two months of release. Their third and fourth releases, Gut Level Music and Against the Grain, propelled them to national standing. Gut Level Music was explicitly aimed at a secular audience, and marked changes designed to enhance their credibility with that audience. Their lyrical approach changed toward a more subtle expression of their faith. They also refined their sound in an attempt to distance themselves from the punk \\"garage band\\" image that they had acquired early on. Their final studio album, Forever Mercy, was released in 1989 and supported with another tour. Sometime after the tour, Ric Alba left the band and was replaced by Mark Robertson. Work had begun on a follow-up album, tentatively titled No Substitute, when the Altar Boys went on an \\"indefinite hiatus\\" in 1992. The group did a number of reunion concerts; most notable was Cornerstone 2000 and 2002, and the Broken Records reunion event in July 2005. The group's final performance occurred in June 2006 at the Corona del Mar Fairgrounds. The group of four performed live for their final show on September 16, 2018 at House of Blues - Anaheim for the new record release of the No Substitute album. At the sold-out performance, the Altar Boys performed crowd favorites Gut Level Music, a few new songs from No Substitute, and other well-known songs from their other albums. Mike Stand's son also made guest appearances on both drums and backing guitar. The show's opening act was Crumbacher, which was their first reunion since 2011. Mike Stand has resurrected many of the Altar Boys songs with a \\"punktry\\" project called The Altar Billies. Drummer and Stand's cousin, Jeff Crandall, is currently a connector with Worship Catalyst in Tucson, Arizona who acts as a mentor, coach and trainer to worship leaders in Tucson and across the country.

He was the son of Targe Arnebergh and Amelia Graagaard, who were of Norwegian and Danish ancestry. Although he dropped out of high school at the age of fifteen, he received a law degree through extension learning. Career Arnebergh won the election for Los Angeles City Attorney in 1953 because he was supported by Ray L. Chesebro, who was retiring. He would be re-elected five times with little opposition. Throughout his 20 years as city attorney, Arneburgh usually ran unopposed. However in 1973, Burt Pines and Ira Reiner both ran for the office against Arneburgh. He was then forced into a runoff against Burt Pines, who won by 58%. During those 20 years in office, Arnebergh led a department that increased from 76 to 185 lawyers and was widely praised for his fair handling of disputes among city departments and his enforcement of misdemeanors. After 1973, Arnebergh practiced law privately in Van Nuys. He was briefly in the limelight in 1991, as part of Citizens for Integrity and Viability in the City Charter, which supported former Police Chief Daryl Gates, and was against changes in the selection, removal and tenure of future police chiefs.

The studio has - to this date - produced two films, A Wicked Tale and e‚ÄôTzaintes, both of which premi√®red to critical acclaim in the international film festival circuit. The studio‚Äôs mission is to create a platform for writers, storytellers, musicians and film-makers to come together to present alternative art forms to mainstream audiences. Their Mantra ‚Äì To Provoke the Senses and Open the Mind. History INRI studio was a concept that came about in 1999 when Tzang Merwyn Tong and long time friend Armen Rizal Rahman, an aspiring musician, decide that it was time they band together to create a production company they can call their own. They roped in Lee Amizadai and together the unit identified themselves as INRI studio. The trio went on to make their very first film together. Using their scrap earnings and savings that they have accumulated over the years, the team of film-makers started work on their first film e‚ÄôTzaintes. The film‚Äôs a teenage black comedy about a bunch of social outcasts. It was a project that took them 3 years to complete. The film was a hit when it premi√®red at GV Grand at Great World City in Singapore on January 2003. Tickets to this independent premi√®re were completely sold out with people even paying to sit on the aisles. e‚ÄôTzaintes went to travel to a couple of film festivals. It premi√®red in Europe in 2004 as the Opening Night Film of the Berlin Asia-Pacific Film Festival and was screened as part of the Asian New Force at the Hong Kong IFVA Festival. The studio then embarked on their second film, A Wicked tale, starring Evelyn Maria Ng as the Little Red Riding Hood character in Tzang Merwyn Tong‚Äôs dark re-imagination of the Brothers Grimm fable. The film made its World Premiere to a full house crowd at the Rotterdam International Film Festival and was later invited to FanTasia Film Festival to be screened as one of the Closing Night films. The movie won the Gold Remi Award at WorldFest in Houston. On December 2005, INRI studio made history by being the first short film in Singapore to be released commercially on DVD. The INRI studio collective now consists of artists, writers, musicians and filmmakers coming together to explore new ways of how they can take things to the next level. An underground music project is currently in the pipeline. Etymology The word INRI is inspired by the inscription on the cross from which Jesus Christ was crucified. INRI is a Latin acronym for Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum (literally translated as Jesus of Nazareth King of Jews). The letters can be found inscribed on a stylized plaque (or parchment) hanging just above the corpse of Christ on many depictions of the Crucifixion. Contrary to belief, the use of the name INRI is neither religious nor sacrilegious. Tzang Merwyn is known to be a big fan of mythology and he considers the crucifixion a romantic and inspiring historic parable. It‚Äôs a story about a man (assumed by many as a heretic) who refuses to deny accusations that he was the Saviour even though he was about to be nailed to the cross. The story is symbolical of the kind sacrifice one has to make to stage a revolution, and the letters, INRI, a reminder to Tzang and his team mates that mockery and ridicule awaits those who choose to do things differently.

Located in the Manawatu District of the North Island, it opened in 1879 and operated until 1895. Construction In the late 1870s, sleepers were required for the Foxton & Wanganui Railway (later the Wanganui Branch, the now-closed Foxton Branch, and parts of the North Island Main Trunk railway and Marton - New Plymouth Line). Accordingly, a 3.5 km line was constructed from Taonui, near Feilding, in a northeasterly direction towards Colyton to reach a stand of totara trees. It was opened on 17 November 1879, and over the next three years it was overseen by three separate authorities: initially the Railways Commissioners; then the Public Works Department from 20 April 1881; and finally the New Zealand Railways Department from the start of July 1882.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 33. Operation Despite being officially designated a branch line, it was little more than an elongated siding. No stations were located on the line and it never carried passengers. Soon after opening, horses substituted for locomotive power as a means of saving money - the animals pulled the wagons up the line, and gravity took the wagons back down the moderate descent to Taonui. The line was not just used to provide the national railways with sleepers; some private timber companies also offered traffic. However, this traffic was not significant and closing the line was proposed by 1893. Closure came on 14 August 1895 and the rails were gone by February the next year. The branch today No earthworks at all were required for the line and no traces of the formation survive. The only extant remnant is the station building from the junction in Taonui. It closed in the 1960s and was subsequently relocated to a farmer's paddock near its original location. A few decades later, the farmer donated it to the Feilding and District Steam Rail Society. It has now been restored and included as part of the society's depot in Feilding, and the restoration work earned the society a Certificate of Merit from the Rail Heritage Trust of New Zealand, awarded on 2 June 2002.Feilding and District Steam Rail Society, \\"Taonui Railway Station\\", accessed 27 November 2007.

Biography Del Pino joined Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement at the age of 17, in December 1955. He was arrested and sent to prison in early 1957. After his release he went to exile in Venezuela, where he was arrested during the uprising against dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez. In early 1958, he returned to Cuba and joined Fidel Castro's guerrillas in the mountains of Sierra Maestra. By the end of the war against Batista's dictatorship, Del Pino was a first lieutenant. After the Cuban Revolution, he joined the new Cuban Air Force at the beginning of 1959 and began his flying training to become a fighter pilot. In April 1961, he flew against CIA-sponsored armed forces in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Flying a Lockheed T-33 jet, he shot down two Douglas B-26 Invaders and sunk several enemy vessels. During the three-day battle, Rafael del Pino flew 25 combat missions.Wyden (1979), p.251 As a result of the decisive role of Cuban pilots during this historic event, president Fidel Castro declared them \\"Heroes of Playa Giron\\". In October 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, General Rafael del Pino was assigned to assist President Fidel Castro in all matters regarding the Air Force. In 1987, Del Pino's antagonism with Fidel Castro regime reached the maximum level and he decided to break with the regime on May 28 of that year, flying in an Aero Caribbean twin engine Cessna 402 to Key West, Florida, with all of his family. Del Pino thereafter has become an active promoter of Western democracy for Cuba. For that purpose he founded in 1996 the \\"Cuban American Military Counsel\\" (CAMCO) with former opponent Erneido Oliva, second military leader of the 2506 Brigade in the Bay of Pigs invasion.

The species is endemic to Southeast Asia. It was first described by Friedrich Boie in 1827. Description G. oxycephalum is a robust powerful snake, with wide smooth scales on its belly that are ideal for climbing trees and across branches. It has smaller, smooth scales on its back, which is usually bright green or light green and may have a black net-like pattern. A gray-colored morph with a yellow head exists in Panay, in the Philippines. As some of its common names indicate, the snake has a green body with a red tail, but is usually brown. It also has a dark line horizontally across the eye. On the sides of its black tongue there may be brown and blue colour. The top of the head may be dark green, yellow-green, or yellow in colour. Image:Gonyosoma oxycephalum.jpgGonyosoma oxycephalum, Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand Image:Elaphe oxycephala.jpgGonyosoma oxycephalum The female can reach a length of up to 2.4 m (almost 8 feet), while the male is generally a little bit smaller but brighter in coloration. Longevity The average life span of G. oxycephalum in captivity is 20 years. Reproduction G. oxycephalum reaches sexually maturity at 4 years of age, and its eggs have a hatching time from 13 to 16 weeks. The female lays on average between 3 and 8 eggs usually between September and January and the hatchlings are about 45 cm (18 inches) long. Behavior The red-tailed green ratsnake lives and spends its life in the trees and in cavities in trees. It seldom descends to the ground. When the snake is stressed, it may inflate a bag of air in its neck, making it appear larger in size. In captivity, it has quite the \\"attitude\\" and may strike at or bite an unwary handler. Its temperament can be unpredictable and may change from time to time but an individual may become tame through proper handling. Diet G. oxycephalum feeds almost exclusively on birds, bird eggs, lizards, and bats. It catches them in mid-air while hanging amongst branches. In captivity, it can be trained to feed on rodents such as mice and rats. Distribution G. oxycephalumm is found in the following countries: *Indonesia (Bangka, Belitung, Java, Kalimantan/Borneo, Karimata, Legundi, Lombok, Mentawai islands, Natuna islands, Nias, Panaitan, Riau archipelago, Sebuku, Sumatra, Tambelan archipelago), *Malaysia (Malaya and East Malaysia, Pulau Tioman ?), *Singapore Island, Penang Island, *India (Andaman Islands), *Myanmar, *Thailand (incl. Phuket), Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, *Philippine Islands (Balabac, Bohol, Catanduanes, Lubang, Luzon, Negros, Palawan, Sulu Archipelago, Panay). The Type locality is Indonesia: Java (F. Boie, 1827).

'And Richie remained a nice, quiet kid.'... Just as Richie was turning 12, the Incognitos moved to Glendale, Ariz.\\" Incognito played offense and defense at Mountain Ridge High School in Glendale, and served as a long snapper, helping the Mountain Lions football team to an 8‚Äì4 record and the first round of the state playoffs in 2000. An All-America offensive lineman, Incognito was named to PrepStar's 120-man Dream Team. He was a second-team honoree on the Long Beach Press-Telegram's Best in the West list. Incognito was a finalist for the Arizona Player-of-the-Year Award, was named the Brian Murray Award winner, and earned the Frank Kush Award, given to the best offensive lineman in Arizona. He also earned First-team All-State honors on offense from the Arizona Republic. Incognito also earned one letter in track and field (shot put) and also competed in weight lifting. College career In 2001, Incognito redshirted at the University of Nebraska.(April 2005) Richie Incognito ESPN.com. Retrieved May 2, 2009. In 2002, he became the first Husker freshman offensive lineman to start in the season opener and just the third rookie lineman to earn any start in his first year of competition. He played in all 14 games, starting 13 at left tackle and posted the second-highest season pancake total in Husker history with 171.St. Louis Rams bio He was named a first-team freshman All-American by FWAA, Sporting News, and Rivals.com as well as first-team freshman All-Big 12 by the Sporting News. At the same time, however, Incognito began displaying the behavioral problems that would follow him throughout his career. During a practice early in the 2002 season, he hit walk-on lineman Jack Limbaugh from behind, prompting Limbaugh to stomp off the field in disgust. During his second game, against Troy State, he was accused of spitting on a Troy State player. Two weeks later, he was ejected for picking a fight in a blowout loss to Penn State. Per NCAA rules, he had to sit out the first half of the Huskers' next game, against Iowa State. In the second-to-last game of the season, against Colorado, he was flagged for a 15-yard personal foul penalty late in the game that largely contributed to the Huskers losing to the Buffaloes. In the spring of 2003, Incognito was involved in a fight during practice and was suspended indefinitely by head coach Frank Solich. By this time, Solich and his staff were concerned enough about Incognito's behavior to send him to the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas for anger management treatment. Incognito was reinstated by the start of the season and started 13 games at left tackle. He was rewarded with a first-team All-Big 12 selection by the Associated Press. However, during the Huskers' victory in the 2003 Alamo Bowl, he was accused of spitting on two Michigan State players. In February 2004, Incognito was involved in a fight at a party and was charged with three counts of assault. In June, he was found guilty on one of the misdemeanor assault charges and paid a $500 fine. Incognito was shifted to center during the 2004 preseason camp. He entered the season with high expectations, listed on a number of preseason lists as a top center and named to the watch list for the Rimington Trophy going to the best center in college football. On September 1, however, he was suspended indefinitely for repeated violations of team rules. The final straw for new coach Bill Callahan came when Incognito was once again involved in a fight in the locker room. Within a few weeks, Incognito withdrew from all classes at Nebraska and left Lincoln. In late September, he transferred to the University of Oregon, only to be dismissed from the team a week later. Head coach Mike Bellotti said Incognito failed to meet the conditions he had agreed to meet before his arrival in Eugene. Bellotti didn't elaborate, but Incognito had been required to complete an anger-management course and adhere to a strict code of conduct. Professional career =Pre-draft= At the 2005 NFL Combine, Incognito impressed scouts by being \\"the strongest and most explosive player in attendance\\". However, during a drill, Incognito stumbled and was carted off the field with a knee injury.(February 26, 2005) Workouts turn into disasters for Incognito, Clarett Sports Illustrated.com Retrieved May 2, 2009. The injury was later found to be a minor sprain that would have no long-term effect. Despite his impressive physical tools, ESPN Scouts Inc. noted \\"his inability to control his emotions both on and off the field is such a significant concern that he'll likely slip to the later rounds of the draft.\\" Years later, then-Kansas City Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli, who was the player personnel director of the New England Patriots in 2005, said that he did not even consider taking Incognito then, \\"and I don't want him now\\" in Kansas City. Pioli had long been known for drafting players with checkered pasts. At the same time, former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy said that Incognito was on the Colts' \\"DNDC\\" (\\"do not draft because of character\\") list in 2005.Brinson, Will. Tony Dungy, Scott Pioli say Richie Incognito was off draft boards.

That year, he blocked for an offense which produced a 4,000-yard passer, a 1,500-yard rusher, and two 1,000-yard receivers, one of only four offenses in NFL history to accomplish the feat. 2007 season Incognito played and started at the right guard position for four games after being inactive for the first four weeks of the season. In early November, Incognito suffered a knee injury that forced him to miss the remainder of season. However, while rehabilitating, it was later revealed that he had been partying nightly. 2008 season Incognito started 15 games at right guard for the Rams, also seeing some playing time at center. On October 17, Incognito was fined three times for a total of $35,000 after the game versus the Washington Redskins. His violations during the game included repeatedly berating an official, a \\"major face mask\\" on a field goal attempt, and a chop block. The last penalty was not called during the game, but was detected on a video review. Incognito's behavior nearly led to a loss after he was called for a 15-yard personal foul penalty before the eventual game-winning field goal. Incognito was part of an offensive line that allowed 45 sacks. Although this was still among the league's 10 worst in terms of sacks allowed, it was the fewest allowed by the Rams since 2003. Following the 2008 season, Incognito became a restricted free agent, although he continued to work out with the Rams during the off-season. 2009 season On April 17, 2009, the Rams offered Incognito a one-year tender worth $1.01 million, which he signed on May 3.Thomas, Jim (April 17, 2009). \\"Adeyanju signs, Incognito will sign, St. Louis Rams tender offers\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

On December 13, during the first half of a 47‚Äì7 loss to the Tennessee Titans, Incognito drew two 15-yard penalties for headbutting Titans players. Head coach Steve Spagnuolo benched him for the second half, and the two got into a heated confrontation on the sidelines. It was the second time Incognito had been benched for losing his composure; he had been pulled from the season opener against Seattle for two personal fouls. However, the Titans incident was the last straw; the Rams waived him two days after the game. In 2013, former Rams general manager Billy Devaney told ESPN that Spagnuolo had given Incognito numerous chances to clean up his act, and had put him on notice that the Rams would cut ties with him if he couldn't control his anger. The two personal fouls led to a $50,000 fine from the NFL and a letter from the league office warning him that \\"future infractions of the types you have committed may lead to increased disciplinary action up to and including suspension.\\"La Canfora, Jason.

Following the season's end, Incognito announced his intent to retire, noting that a recent doctor's visit had revealed he was suffering from liver and kidney failure, which he attributed to stress. Incognito also expressed dissatisfaction with a contract restructuring that would have kept him with the Bills in 2018, noting that he had given the Bills until April 15 to give him an offer worthy of his putting off his retirement for one more season. Two days later, the Bills officially placed Incognito on the reserve/retired list. On April 13, 2018, Incognito announced he had had a change of heart and would show up to offseason workouts on April 16, 2018. He failed to arrive for the workouts, and the Bills continued to list him as retired. He indicated that he refused to play for the Bills and demanded he be released from his contract; the Bills responded that he would have to contact league commissioner Roger Goodell if he wanted to be removed from the retired list.http://buffalonews.com/2018/04/16/bills-brass-largely-sidesteps- questions-about-richie-incognito/ On May 21, 2018, the Bills released Incognito from the reserve/retired list. =Oakland / Las Vegas Raiders= On May 28, 2019, Incognito signed with the Oakland Raiders. On July 12, 2019, the NFL suspended Incognito for two games for violating the league's personal conduct policy, stemming from last year's incident at a funeral home in Arizona. He was reinstated from suspension on September 16, and the Raiders were given a roster exemption for him. He was placed on the active roster the next day. On December 30, 2019, the Raiders signed Incognito to a two-year, $14 million contract extension. On September 23, 2020, Incognito was placed on injured reserve with an Achilles injury. Bullying scandal and other controversies In November 2013, ESPN reported on Incognito's alleged role in harassment of teammate Jonathan Martin. According to Incognito, he had reached out to Martin after he had left the team, and the two had an amicable text exchange, in which Incognito claims Martin said he did not blame him or his teammates personally. Incognito subsequently expressed outrage over the report, going on Twitter to demand that ESPN's Adam Schefter \\"Stop slandering my name.\\" Schefter and Chris Mortensen reported on ESPN on November 3 that Martin fears \\"retribution, primarily from Incognito.\\" The article goes on to state that \\"the matter is absolutely under review and preliminarily identifies Incognito as an alleged offender in multiple incidents of possible harassment and bullying over the past two seasons, with Martin not the only victim.\\" Schefter and Mortensen also cited unnamed sources that one of the significant allegations is an incident during the summer of 2013 when Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to Las Vegas by a group of Dolphins, even though Martin preferred not to, \\"fearing the consequences if he did not hand over the money.\\" On November 3, Mike Garafolo reported on Fox Sports 1 that Incognito is alleged to have sent Martin threatening and racially charged messages. He also reported that the team and league‚Äîrather than the players' association‚Äîhas been asked to investigate. That same day, Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports reported that Incognito \\"has had to be reprimanded in the past for his actions toward team employees,\\" citing an unnamed source. La Canfora and Schefter subsequently reported statements from an unnamed source that the team and the league are now in possession of highly disturbing texts and voicemails in which Incognito used a racial slur against Martin, and disturbing text and voice exchanges including \\"a reference to tracking down members of Martin's family and harming them\\" and even threatening to kill Martin. According to La Canfora, Incognito's alleged harassment of Martin had gotten to the point that Martin actually feared for his safety, and felt that leaving the team was his only option. Just hours after the Dolphins' game against the Cincinnati Bengals, the Dolphins suspended Incognito indefinitely for conduct detrimental to the team. The Dolphins also asked the NFL to join their own internal investigation of the matter. According to Schefter, the final straw for the Dolphins was a highly graphic voicemail Incognito left in April 2013, in which Incognito called Martin a \\"half-nig*er piece of s*it,\\" threatened to slap Martin's mother across the face and even uttered a death threat against Martin. Until then, the Dolphins had publicly maintained the charges against Incognito were pure speculation. Schefter said that as late as the afternoon of November 3, the Dolphins didn't even know the voicemail existed. Within hours of hearing the tape, Schefter said, the Dolphins had suspended Incognito. The next day, a Dolphins source told The Miami Herald that Incognito would never play another down for the Dolphins again, and that the team intended to cut ties with him at the earliest opportunity. On November 5, the (Fort Lauderdale) Sun-Sentinel quoted \\"multiple sources\\" as saying that Incognito may have taken orders from Dolphins coaches to \\"toughen up\\" Martin too far. The Sun-Sentinel reported that the controversial voice mail message that ultimately led to Incognito's suspension was made after Martin missed two days of the team's voluntary workout program. The coaches asked Incognito‚Äîby this time, reckoned as the leader of the offensive line‚Äîto make a call that would \\"get him into the fold.\\" On November 7, reports emerged that Miami GM Jeff Ireland reacted to the allegations by suggesting that Martin punch Incognito ‚Äì however, rather than take things that far, Martin chose to leave the team. Under the NFL's collective bargaining agreement, Incognito was initially slated to sit out for a maximum of four weeks. At the end of that time, the Dolphins would have had to either release him or find some way to keep him off the field, given earlier statements that he would never appear in a Dolphins uniform again. However, the league and the Dolphins agreed to extend the suspension for another two weeks with pay. On December 16, the league and the Dolphins announced that Incognito would remain suspended for the remainder of the season. On February 3, 2014, the text messages exchanged between Martin and Incognito were leaked. It is thought that \\"the leak came from Incognito or someone close to him, because the text messages tend to support the notion that Incognito and Martin were friends. Moreover, nothing in the Incognito text messages suggests harassment or bullying of Martin.\\" On February 4, 2014, Incognito's 3-month long suspension ended. =Investigator's report= On February 14, 2014, lawyer Ted Wells released a report (NFL summary) following an investigation into the matter ordered by the NFL. The investigation concluded that Incognito, and to a lesser extent fellow offensive linemen John Jerry and Mike Pouncey, bullied Martin, yet another (unnamed) Dolphins offensive lineman, and also a Dolphins staff member, an unnamed assistant trainer.Eder, Steve, and Ben Shpigel,\\"Two Dolphins' Paths to a Bullying Scandal\\", New York Times, February 24, 2014; retrieved February 25, 2014 The report also concluded that Incognito, Jerry, and Pouncey made severe racial slurs towards the assistant trainer, and Incognito and Jerry even taunted him by saying that they had sex with his girlfriend. On December 7, 2012, the anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Incognito, Jerry and Pouncey donned traditional Japanese headbands featuring a rising sun emblem (which the assistant trainer had given them) and jokingly threatened to harm the assistant trainer physically in retaliation for the Pearl Harbor attack. The assistant trainer, who is from Japan, confided in Martin that he was upset about the Pearl Harbor comments, finding them derogatory toward his heritage. Further, the report concluded regarding Martin's \\"mental health problems, alcohol and drug use and... concerns about poor performance on the field\\" that \\"his text messages and other evidence demonstrate that these are real factors, not issues Incognito has manufactured out of whole cloth.\\" The report noted a published newspaper report regarding Martin's difficulties with the position change the Dolphins made with him days before he left the team and alleged harassment. The Miami Herald noted that the Dolphins were concerned about Martin's reaction to the move, and noted that \\"It was clear Martin isn't thrilled about the move.\\" \\"You can approach this two different ways,\\" Martin said. \\"You can go in the tank and be one of those guys who bitches and moans and is a cancer in the locker room, or you can be a guy who goes out there and can be a professional and plays as hard as I can.\\" =Allegations of dirty play= Incognito has garnered attention over the years for perceived dirty play amongst NFL players, coaches, and fans. He has been alleged to have gouged players' eyes, punched players, and made illegal tackles on a regular basis. In 2009, NFL players voted Incognito as the dirtiest player in the league, according to a Sporting News poll. =Response= After the bullying scandal and his release from the Dolphins organization, Incognito sought help through therapy when he voluntarily checked himself into an Arizona treatment facility. After months of treatment, Incognito described his experience and growth as \\"very difficult\\" because \\"there's no doubt things were said and things were texted and things were done where I clearly crossed the line...that's part of the learning process I went through, and just growing up and maturing and being aware of your surroundings and who your audience is.\\" After sitting out the 2014 season, Rex Ryan and the Buffalo Bills signed Incognito for the 2015 season with the intent to \\"build a bully\\". According to teammate Eric Wood, Incognito was seen as an \\"ultimate professional\\" and \\"quickly became a locker room favorite\\". Incognito re-elevated his game and helped the Buffalo Bills lead the league in rushing yards and yards-per-carry. Prior to the 2016 season, Incognito sat down with Colin Cowherd for an interview on the radio show The Herd where he talked about his relationship with Jonathan Martin since the bullying scandal stating their relationship ended that day, and that \\"You learn from it you move on\\". =Involuntary commitment= On May 23, 2018, Incognito was placed on an \\"involuntary psychiatric hold\\" for his part in an altercation at a Life Time Fitness health club in Boca Raton, Florida. Incognito allegedly threw a tennis ball and a dumbbell at another gym patron. He was reported to be in an \\"altered, paranoid state,\\" suspecting that he was being spied on. On June 6, 2018, he was back in training, hoping to get back to the NFL. =Commentary on Minnesota Vikings' head coach Mike Zimmer= On August 7, 2018 Mike Zimmer, head coach of the Minnesota Vikings, was asked if he was interested in Incognito's services after Richie implied as much on Twitter. Zimmer responded with, \\"No interest, and totally false. Tweet that.\\" In response, Incognito sent out vulgarity- laced Tweets, including calling Zimmer a \\"fucking liar\\", but later deleted them and apologized for the outburst. =Funeral home incident and arrest= On August 20, 2018, Incognito was arrested and taken into custody after an incident at a funeral home where he threatened to shoot the employees while making funeral arrangements for his father. Police seized two Glocks, three rifles, and a suppressor for a handgun in Incognito's truck. Employees told Scottsdale police that Incognito wanted his father's head cut off for research purposes, and that he had walked through the funeral home punching caskets and throwing objects. Incognito was charged with disorderly conduct and making threats. Personal life Incognito is the oldest son of Richard Incognito Sr. and Donna Incognito, who also have a younger son, Derek. His father was of Italian and German descent. Incognito supports Operation Homefront, an organization that provides assistance to families of service members and wounded soldiers. During the 2012 season, he hosted a private screening and book reading of the animated film Rise of the Guardians for Operation Homefront, where he led a book reading to over 100 children before the screening of the film. Politically, he is a supporter of the Republican Party, and publicly supported Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential election. In July 2018, Incognito was named a national ambassador for Boo2Bullying, an anti- bullying nonprofit based in Los Angeles. In a statement announcing this nomination, he said he could \\"relate to both sides\\", being bullied and bullying others.

It featured many Christian musicians and some of today's top Christian bands. The festival was sponsored by nearby Greenville College and had been student-run since its inception in 1977. AgapeFest was generally held the last weekend in April or first weekend in May, and bands performed from early afternoon Friday until late evening on Saturday. They offered free camping and free parking to attendees. Unfortunately, the festival culminated after 2013's event. Greenville College was unable provide funding for AgapeFest in 2014, and that year's planned festival was not hosted. AgapeFest has not been hosted since and currently has no plans to return as a two-day festival. However, Greenville College hosted Encore Music festival in its place in 2014 http://papyrus.greenville.edu/2014/05/encore-music-festival/ and currently brings events such as Propaganda (musician), Noah Gundersen, and the Nashville Contemporary Music Center's Holotour to campus. Past festivals have featured Christian musicians like TobyMac, Audio Adrenaline, Kutless, Hawk Nelson, Lecrae, Owl City, RunKidRun, BarlowGirl, Salvador, Relient K, Sanctus Real, Newsboys, Jeremy Camp, Falling Up, John Reuben, David Crowder Band, Superchick, Skillet, Five Iron Frenzy, Switchfoot, Jars of Clay, The O.C.

The snakes are brown above with a dark brownish patch on the head that appears like a bird silhouette on the head. The underside is patterned in yellow and black. Scale pattern :See Snake scales for terminology used Head and dorsal markings The average length of a fully grown western kukri is about 13 inches, with a two-inch tail. This snake is brown on top, with dark transverse lines over the top. The top of the head bears a dark symmetrical marking. Its lower surface is patterned in yellow (becoming white in spirit preserved specimens) with square black spots, both colours being distributed in nearly equal proportion. Like all snakes, they are most reliably identified by the pattern of scales. The scales of this species are smooth; there are 7 supralabial scales (along the upper lip), and 17 rows of dorsal scales. They have between 128 and 133 (in males), or 130 and 145 (in females), ventral scales. The anal scale is divided, and they have between 31 and 36 (in males), or 23 and 30 (in females) paired subcaudal scales.Whitaker, Romulus and Ashok Captain 2004 Snakes of India. Draco Books. Young individual The head of the snake has a divided nasal scale; the portion of rostral scale seen from above is half as long as its distance from the frontal scale, which itself is as long as the parietal scales (much longer than its distance from the end of the snout). The suture between the internasal scales is often as long as that between the prefrontal scales. Rather than a loreal scale the postnasal half of the divided nasal scale sometimes forms a suture with the preocular scale. They have one preocular scale and two postocular scales. They have one primary temporal and two secondary temporal scales (1+2) or one primary and secondary followed by a split tertiary temporal scale (1+1+2); of the seven supralabial scales the third and fourth touch the eye, the four sublabial scales are in contact with the anterior chin shields; the posterior chin shields are about two-thirds the length of the anterior.

Owned and operated by Cogeco following its 2018 acquisition of most of the stations formerly owned by RNC Media, the station airs a francophone adult contemporary format branded as Wow 104,9 102,1 FM. The station airs a mix of locally produced programming and simulcasting of RNC's CJLA-FM in Lachute, Quebec. Despite simulcasting the majority of its programming, CHPR is one of only four all-francophone commercial radio stations licensed to communities in Ontario; the other three stations are all in Northeastern Ontario and are owned by Le5 Communications. History CHPR was originally launched in 1976 as a daytimer on AM radio channel 1110 to rebroadcast the programming of Cornwall's CFIX. In 1983, ownership of the stations was transferred to Guy Vaillancourt, who also owned CJLA. Due to the area's unique circumstances as a predominantly franco-ontarian community with limited local media service due to the region's proximity to the Montreal market, the station was also licensed at that time to launch a low power FM repeater to improve reception and provide a nighttime service. Vaillancourt shutdown CFIX that year, and subsequently transferred CHPR's programming source to CJLA. In 1985, he committed to produce 32 hours per week of local programming on CHPR, with CJLA providing the station's programming the rest of the time.Decision CRTC 85-491 In 1987, the FM transmitter increased its signal to 780 watts.Decision CRTC 87-190 The AM transmitter was discontinued at that time. Also that year, CHPR and CJLA affiliated with the Radiomutuel network.Decision CRTC 87-309 The following year, the stations were acquired by Radio Fusion, a subsidiary of RNC Media.Decision CRTC 88-489 In 1997, RNC Media became the direct licensee of the stations after a corporate reorganization. CHPR was also licensed to increase its signal to 3 kW, and to reduce its local programming to 15 hours per week.Decision CRTC 97-49 In the fall of 2006, the station changed to a more oldies-leaning AC format as Lov Radio, even though the AC currents remain on the station. The station rebranded as Plan√®te Lov' in August 2008, because of RNC rebranding most of their stations to the Plan√®te name. By 2010, CHPR-FM decreased the amount of oldies played on the station.

Although widespread, it occurs in low densities, even within protected areas. It is threatened by hunting and habitat loss. It prefers clear, large or medium rivers with sandy bottoms. It spends most of time concealed below the sand, sometimes with only the tip of the nose exposed.  Eating habits  Skeletal proof of long neck Buried in sand, the Indian narrow-headed softshell turtle waits for its prey to come into its reach. When this happens, the turtle's head extends out of its shell at a high velocity in order to grab then eat the prey organism with its mouth. In a 2009 video from Animal Planet's show River Monsters, this turtle is seen quickly extending its head and long retractable neck out of its shell.

The \\"flap-shelled\\" name stems from the presence of femoral flaps located on the plastron. These flaps of skin cover the limbs when they retract into the shell. It is unclear what protection the flaps offer against predators.Franklin, Carl (2007). Turtles: An Extraordinary Natural History 245 Million Years in the Making. Voyageur Press. pp. 134-136. Indian flapshell turtles are widespread and common in the South Asian provinces. Description The carapace of L. punctata viewed from above is broadly oval in adults, but more circular in young, widest just anterior to hind limbs. The width of the disc is 77-86% of its length, the carapace is moderately arched, shell height is 35.0-40.5% of carapace length, the margin of the carapace is smooth and slightly flared posteriorly, the marginal bones are not united with the pleurals, the plastron is large but mostly cartilaginous, and its length is 88-97% of the carapace length. A pair of large flaps can be closed over the hind limbs and a smaller flap over tail; seven plastral callosities are present, and the head is large, its width is 21-25% of the carapace width. The nose is short and stout; the nasal septum has no lateral ridge, the edges of the jaws are smooth, the alveolar surfaces are expanded and granular. The claws are large and heavy; the penis is thick and oval, with deep dorsal cleft and four pointed, soft papillae; the tail is very short in both sexes.Minton SA Jr (1966). \\"A contribution to the herpetology of West Pakistan\\".

Lissemys punctata. Ernst C, Altenburg R, Barbour R (1997). Turtles of the World. Netherlands Biodiversity Information Facility. Status The Indian flapshell turtle was placed in Appendix II of CITES in 1975 at the request of Bangladesh. However, L. p. punctata was the taxon listed, not L. p. andersoni. Subsequent reviews of the literature and available data could find no evidence to support this endangered status. Some scientists now classify L. p. punctata and L. p. andersoni as a single subspecies. This subspecies is the most common aquatic turtle in India. Consequently, the Indian flapshell turtle was removed from the endangered species list in 1983 (48 FR 52740). This action, however, did not affect the turtle's status on Appendix II of CITES.CRS Report for Congress.98-32:Endangered Species List Revisions:A Summary of Delisting and Downlisting (cont'd)Status Distribution The Indian flapshell turtle is found in Pakistan, India (common in lakes and rivers), Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh (Indus and Ganges drainages), and Myanmar (Irrawaddy and Salween Rivers). It has been introduced to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is also found in the desert ponds of Rajasthan, where hundreds are killed every year during the dry summers. The race L. p. andersoni is found in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. In 2020 a farmer found a yellow flapshell turtle, believed to be an albino version of the species. Fossils of this species from as early as the Miocene are known from Nepal.

Its diet consists of frogs, fishes, shrimp, snails, aquatic vegetation, plant leaves, flowers, fruits, grasses, and seeds. =Habitat and environmental impact= L. punctata lives in the shallow, quiet, often stagnant waters of rivers, streams, marshes, ponds, lakes and irrigation canals, and tanks. Waters with sand or mud bottoms are preferredErnst CH, Altenburg RGM, Barbour RW (1997). Turtles of the World. Indian flapshell turtle because of the turtle's tendency to burrow. L. punctata turtle plays an important role to reduce pollution in aquatic ecosystems by feeding on snails, insects, and fragments of dead animals.Hossain L, Sarker S, Sarker N (2008). \\"Ecology of spotted flapshell turtle, Lissemys punctata (Lacepede, 1788) in Bangladesh\\". Department of Zoology, University of Dhaka. ECOPRINT. 15: 59-67. =Drought survival= L. punctata is very well adapted, both morphologically and behaviorally, to drought conditions. The turtle uses mainly burrowing and moving from water hole to water hole to avoid desiccation. The femoral flaps that cover the retracted legs help the turtle survive dry conditions. During a time of drought, the turtles enter a time of estivation in an attempt to survive the dry conditions.Auffenberg W (1981). \\"Behavior of Lissemys punctata in a drying lake in Rajasthan, India\\". Bombay 78 (3): 487-493. Although many turtles die during drought conditions, some turtles have been reported to survive up to 160 days. Reproduction =Courtship routines= L. punctata becomes reproductively active at age 2 or 3. Courtship and mating behavior is unique. Courtship begins when the male begins stroking the female's carapace with his neck and limbs extended. When receptive, the female faces the male with her neck extended and they begin bobbing their heads vertically three or four times. This behavior is repeated, then mating begins when the female settles to the bottom and is mounted by the male. Near the end of mating, the male releases his grip and rotates to face the opposite direction from her. They remain attached in this position for as long as 15 minutes. During this time, the female may drag the male about. The pair then separates and copulation ends. =Nesting= Nesting times of L. punctata occur during many periods in the year depending on habitat and location. Generally starts during the late summer to the monsoon season which is around June to November. Swampy areas with soil and exposure to sunlight are common nesting sites. Eggs are usually laid two or three times per year in clutches of two to 16. These eggs are buried in soil for protection. Scientific interest and potential value *Medicinal value The shell of L. punctata is believed to be of medicinal value in both China and India. The shell is burnt and ground with oil to produce a medicine in China used to treat certain types of skin diseases. In India, the shell is used to make a remedy believed to be a medicine for tuberculosis.Moll D, Moll E (2004). The Ecology, Exploitation, and Conservation of River Turtles. Oxford University Press. pp. 177-180. Specific dangers and threats to species survival *Economic and environmental factors In many South Asian provinces, freshwater turtles and their eggs are commonly used as a source of food. As a result, these turtles are often exploited as a source of profit. In Bangladesh and India, this is especially evident as the Indian flapshell turtle is larger and has more meat than other turtles in the area. The value of this meat along with the efforts in the conservation of this species has driven the price of meat higher and has led to an increase in the illegal international exploitation and killing of these animals. Changes to the turtle's natural habitat by the construction of dams and barrages, cultivation along river banks, and pollution are also major threats to the survival of this turtle.

The species is native to Southeast Asia. It has been considered to be among the largest extant freshwater turtles. The species is endangered and in the 20th century has disappeared from much of its former range. Taxonomy The species is not found in New Guinea, while the two other members of the genus Pelochelys, P. bibroni and P. signifera are both restricted to New Guinea. P. cantorii is relatively unstudied, and the current species may actually be composed of several taxa. One study from 1995 showed what was once thought to be P. cantorii in New Guinea was actually P. bibroni, and the earlier studies of P. cantorii only described populations further to the west. Description The Asian giant softshell turtle has a broad head and small eyes close to the tip of its snout. The carapace is smooth and olive-colored. Juveniles may have dark-spotted carapaces and heads, with yellow around the carapace. Despite reports that it can grow up to in length and is the world's largest extant freshwater turtle, this maximum size and title is murky at best. Apparently the largest specimen carapace length, , known is considered suspect and the heaviest specimen known (weighing approximately was actually a misidentified Yangtze giant softshell turtle. A more realistic range of carapace length for this species is reportedly and it is one of about a half-dozen giant softshell turtles from three genera that reach exceptionally large sizes, i.e. in excess of in mass. The species is an ambush predator and primarily carnivorous, feeding on crustaceans, mollusks and fish (although some aquatic plants may also be eaten). The turtle spends 95% of its life buried and motionless, with only its eyes and mouth protruding from the sand. It surfaces only twice a day to take a breath, and lays 20‚Äì28 eggs sized around in diameter in February or March on riverbanks. Morphological differences in neural bone count have been noted between specimens found in the Philippines and mainland Asia. The species is named after Danish zoologist Theodore Edward Cantor. Distribution and habitat The species P. cantorii is primarily found in inland, slow- moving, freshwater rivers and streams. Some evidence indicates that its range extends to coastal areas, as well. It occurs in eastern and southern India, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, eastern and southern China, the Philippines (Luzon and Mindanao), and Indonesia (Kalimantan, Java, and Sumatra). Conservation The Asian giant softshell turtle is classified as Endangered by the IUCN and has disappeared from much of its range.https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/16502/97400946 Prior to 2007, it was last seen in Cambodia in 2003. A 2007 survey of one area of the Mekong River in Cambodia found the turtle in abundance along a stretch of the river. In the Philippines, a juvenile Cantor's turtle known as ‚Äúcagot\\" appeared and was captured by a fisherman along the Addalam River, Cabarroguis, Quirino, Isabela. In 2001, this turtle was sent to Chicago and its identity confirmed.

It was long believed to be inbred individuals of the Indian softshell turtle (A. gangeticus or N. gangeticus) or the Indian peacock softshell turtle (A. hurum or N. hurum), but while it is a close relative of the latter, it is a distinct species.Praschag et al. (2007) In the 1800s it was believed these turtles were brought from Iran to Chittagong shrine pond by Hazrat Bayezid Bostami. His turtles he had brought to this pond were treated as sacred and respected by the public. Previously declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2002, these turtles were found still to exist in a temple's pond called the Hayagriva Madhava Temple located in Assam, India. Through conservation methods and protection of the species, some of these turtles can be found today throughout the wild, and scientists and environmental biologists are continuing to work hard to preserve this endangered species and their natural habitat. Habitat Originally native to the lower Brahmaputra River, the only population ever reliably known consists of a small number of the species in a man-made pond which is part of the Bayazid Bostami shrine at Chittagong, where they are dependent on humans for survival. To the locals and worshipers, the black softshell turtle is known as mazari (\\"Mazar inhabitant\\"); specimens from this shrine were used in the first scientific description.Anderson (1875), Praschag et al. (2007) In a 2014 survey by Poribesh Banchao Andolon, a Bangladeshi private organization it was found that the amount of oxygen dissolved in the pond water was 2.01 mg/L, whereas the favorable level is 5 mg/L. In 2012, wildlife biologists of the Center for Advanced Research in Natural Resources and Management found a small population in the wild of Sylhet. Two tiny wild populations were discovered in Assam, in Kaziranga and in the Jia Bhoroli River which is a northern tributary of the Brahmaputra. Also, another temple population of these turtles was identified in the Kasopukhuri pond on Nilachal Hill, next to the Kamakhya Temple at Guwahati in Assam.Asmat (2002), Praschag & Gemel (2002), Praschag et al. (2007)  Biology  = Appearance = The black softshell turtle has an observably different appearance compared to that of a common turtle. This turtle, similar to all other softshell turtles, has a semi-flexible shell that is leathery, and does not obstruct movement as much as the average hardshell. The black softshell turtle also has a very distinct nose and face, with a tube like structure protruding from its nose resembling and functioning similar to a snorkel. The ligaments of this turtle are also much more distinct than those of the normal sea turtle or land tortoise, being that they have hand-like structures that are webbed, as opposed to other turtles like sea turtles who have a wider arm. The softshell of the turtle does not protrude out from the body very far, and typically appears somewhat rigid with very little color and design. The skin of the black softshell turtle is often black or dark brown, but can often appear with white to yellow spots that appear across the head and ligaments of the turtle. = Size and weight = The average Bostani turtle adult size can range from widths of 15 inches to 31 inches, and corresponding lengths of 13 inches to 28 inches. The average area of the species can range from 195 inches squared on the low end and 868 inches squared on the larger end. However, the highest recorded size for these turtles is a length of 35 inches. The weight for the average female is around 120 pounds, while the weight of the males has not yet been recorded. However, these males are visually larger indicating strong chances of a larger corresponding weight. = Life span and mortality rate = The highest recorded age for the Bostani turtle has been determined by those living in the area directly, with claims that the oldest turtles present are approximately 150 years old. However, this species has a high mortality rate at the beginning stages of life, with 94% of eggs without hatching capabilities. With an average clutch size of 20, this would allow for the survival of about one egg per two mating turtles. = Diet = With the species existing in very limited areas with high human traffic, these turtles have become dependent upon visitors for feeding. Visitors tend to feed a mixture of grains, fruits, and various meat products. These interactions with direct feeding have created a dependence for these turtles on the people, since this species no longer has a need for hunting. This had made it hard to determine the natural diet of the species. However with the ability to consume the foods provided by the people, their diet is commonly compared to that of other species within the same genus. These organisms are on the omnivore scale of the food consumption, consisting of plants and small animals like fish and worms. = Reproduction = Visitors feeding the turtles in the pond. Nilssonia nigricans are oviparous organisms, in which they reproduce by laying their young as eggs to be hatched. Softshell turtles are known to mature slowly with the males prepared to breed in their fourth year. The female population could take up to seven to nine years to mature. A group of eggs is known as a clutch and a female black soft shelled turtle can lay anywhere between 10-38 eggs in her clutch. The baby turtles will grow in their eggs for 92-108 days before hatching. Recently the hatching rate for this specific species has been decreasing due to these species being endangered.  Behavior  = Hibernation = Hibernation takes place during the late autumn season until the spring for softshell turtles. They bury themselves at the bottom of a river/lake in the mud. Food is not as essential as oxygen during this period. Oxygen is needed at a reduced rate than normal and the turtles practice a technique called ‚Äúpharyngeal breathing‚Äù. This means that they pump water in and out of their throat (pharynx) that contain microvillus projections of small blood vessels. This structure provides them with greater surface area to absorb more oxygen. Near-extinction in the wilderness The Bayazid Bostami shrine with its pond As of 2002, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature classified the species as Extinct in the Wild. In 2004, 408 turtles were found in the pond of the Bayazid Bastami shrine. According to the shrine committee staff, 90 more turtles were hatched in the pond in 2007, 74 in 2008, 96 in 2009, 28 in 2010, 45 in 2012 and 40 in 2014. In 2017, a singular wild turtle was found in the wetlands of Old Akuk Village in Wokha District, Nagaland. DNA from the specimen sent to Bangladesh was tested and ultimately confirmed that it was a member of the black softshell species. This extinction has been caused by human intervention, specifically the migration of people into the habitat and the contamination of water and land following this movement. The land of Bangladesh that N. nigricans have been able to occupy currently had been tested for conditions of survival and mating. The survival rate of juvenile N. nigricans is relatively low due to a low mortality of egg hatching and juvenile survival following hatching. A Bostami turtle being fed by human visitors. Human intervention has also caused a push towards extinction with intentional methods of poisoning. In 2006 there was a mass poisoning of the turtles within the Bostami Shrine pond by poachers in the area. This event occurred within the research period, as the turtles were under heavy observations and were protected from this event, while this not being the first time this method had been used. In this case many of the fish utilized by the N. nigricans for food had been poisoned, making nutrition unsustainable for the turtles. This same poisoning also changed the oxygen levels in the water, making it unsustainable for the turtles. A waiting period had passed to ensure oxygen levels were rich in the water, indicating a sustainable environment, in turn allowing the release of the species. Conservation efforts Since 2013, TSA India has worked diligently to improve conditions at selected temple ponds in Assam where these turtles were discovered. Many of the ponds were eutrophic and overcrowded and often, turtles were fed human food as religious offerings. The turtles showed signs of poor nutrition and a lack of suitable nesting space resulted in eggs being deposited in areas where there was little chance of hatching. The goal of the project is to eventually rear and release juveniles from these captive colonies to supplement depleted wild populations. As part of that initiative, the TSA India team camped at the Nagshankar temple in April to observe nesting in the 40-45 adult females at that location. At that time, the team transferred ten nests to a hatchery and protected four nests onsite. With TSA's efforts 44 turtles have hatched so far. The team is currently expanding a headstarting facility at Nagshankar temple to accommodate the turtle's hatchlings of 2016. Neonates and juveniles cannot be released back into the temple pond due to predation by larger turtles and exotic fish. For this reason, the team acquired an earthen pond in the nearest village to provide space for the fast-growing juveniles, improving survival prospects for this extremely rare softshell. In 2018, Das et al. had collected population sizes of N. nigricans from 2006 to 2012. The population size had shown a gradual increase over time, indicating that the calculated area per turtle had decreased in accordance. He indicated that without an increase in habitat size, the carrying capacity of the species will be reached quicker. This can decrease the overall growth of the species and not allow it to grow past the current conservation status. In 2011, Dr. Jayaditya from the Help Earth NGO found a grouping of black softshell turtles in a temple pond in Hajo, Assam. He revitalized contributions aimed towards saving and replenishing the species once again. He and his team embanked the sides of the temple pond and made adjustments to simulate a natural river system and create an ecosystem more conducive to the turtle's natural habitat. Thereafter, they observed a positive egg ratio produced around the temple premises. The State Zoo of Assam is playing an important role in this conservation project, serving as the location where baby turtles are reared for six months. When deemed fit and healthy, and capable of surviving, the young turtles are released into the wild. As of 2016, the State Zoo of Assam has released 300 turtles. Now 16 temples in Assam are helping in this important project. References Bibliography * Further reading *Anderson J (1875). \\"Description of some new Asiatic Mammals and Chelonia\\".

He earned a Master of Public Health in 1972 and a PhD in 1975 from the University of California, Berkeley for research into Acculturation and Coronary Heart Disease in Japanese Americans. Career Marmot has led research groups on health inequalities for over 35 years. He was chair of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), which was set up by the World Health Organization in 2005, and produced \\"Closing the Gap in a Generation\\" in August 2008. He leads the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and is engaged in several international research efforts on the social determinants of health. He served as President of the British Medical Association (BMA) from 2010 to 2011, and is the new President of the British Lung Foundation. He is a fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, an honorary fellow of the British Academy, and an honorary fellow of the Faculty of Public Health of the Royal College of Physicians. He was a member of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution for six years and in 2000 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, for services to epidemiology and the understanding of health inequalities. Marmot is a Foreign Associate Member of the Institute of Medicine (IOM), and a former vice-president of the Academia Europaea.

Marmot is a Vice-President of the Academia Europaea, a Foreign Associate Member of the Institute of Medicine (IOM), and the chair of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health set up by the World Health Organization in 2005. He won the Balzan Prize for Epidemiology in 2004, gave the Harveian Oration in 2006 and won the William B. Graham Prize for Health Services Research in 2008. Marmot advises the WHO.Rise in life expectancy has stalled since 2010, research shows The Guardian Research Marmot conducted ground-breaking studies of heart disease and stroke, comparing Japanese people in Japan (high stroke rates, low heart attack rates) with those in Hawaii and California, where, especially in later generations, the disease patterns became reversed after adopting lifestyle, stress and diet changes. He has more recently led the Whitehall Studies of British civil servants, again focusing on heart disease and other disease patterns. His department includes the MRC National Survey of Health & Development, a longitudinal study directed by Professor Michael Wadsworth of people born in Britain in 1946 and followed up since. There are 120 other academic staff in the department. Marmot has a special interest in inequalities in health and their causes, and has been a government advisor in seeking to identify ways to mitigate them. He served on the Scientific Advisory Group of the Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health chaired by Sir Donald Acheson, the former UK chief medical officer. This reported in November 1998. In The Status Syndrome: How your social standing directly affects your health and life expectancy, he argues that socio-economic position is an important determinant for health outcomes. This result holds even if we control for the effects of income, education and risk factors (such as smoking) on health. The causal pathway Marmot identifies concerns the psychic benefits of \\"being in control\\" of one's life. Autonomy in this sense is related to our socio-economic position. Based on comparative studies, Marmot argues that we can make our society more participatory and inclusive to increase overall public health. In 2008, Marmot appeared in Unnatural Causes: Is Inequality Making Us Sick?, an American documentary series examining the social determinants of health that drew heavily from Marmot's work on the Whitehall Studies. On 6 November 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that the Secretary of State for Health Alan Johnson had asked Sir Michael Marmot to chair a Review of Health Inequalities in England to inform policy making to address health inequalities from 2010. The Review was announced at the launch of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health report Closing the Gap in a Generation. In 2020 the review was published. It found that life expectancy is falling among the poorest people and particularly amongst women in certain English regions. Real cuts to people‚Äôs incomes are damaging the nation‚Äôs health for the long term; lifespans are stalling,and people are living for more years in poor health.

Retrieved 12 November 2011 . The Fischers lived there from 1938 until 1945. When Fischer and his wife arrived at Hotel Lux, the Stalinist purges were still taking place and the exiles living at the hotel were living in a climate of fear and terror. The autumn after their arrival, Fischer came home from work one evening, looking terrified. Gustl Deutsch, an Austrian who had been arrested and had imprisoned, had managed to smuggle him a note to alert him to the danger facing Fischer. Under torture, Deutsch had named Fischer as being involved in a plot against Stalin's life. Although the charges were completely false, by being accused, Fischer was in grave danger and he immediately sought help from Georgi Dimitrov, one of the leaders of the Comintern. Dimitrov replied, \\"I will be able to save you, but the others...?\\"\\"Nachts kamen Stalins H√§scher\\", p. 102. After the war, Fischer remained an important figure in the KP√ñ until 1969. He served as Communist Minister of Information in the first post-war government of Renner (27 April 1945 ‚Äì 20 December 1945). Fischer and his wife were divorced in 1954. His book, Erinnerungen und Reflexionen (\\"Memories and Reflections\\"), was released around the same time his ex-wife's book came out, Blaues Blut und rote Fahnen. Revolution√§res Frauenleben zwischen Wien, Berlin und Moskau (\\"Blue Blood and Red Flags. Revolutionary Female Life Between Vienna, Berlin and Moscow\\"). The two books covered the same period. Fischer is particularly famous in the West for his book The Necessity of Art (1959). In this Fischer took many of the commonplace concepts of Marxist artistic theory up to that point - art as labor, collective vs individual, formalism and socialist realism - and develops them in a wide-ranging essay on the history of art from magic and religion to the Romantics, critical realism and art in the service of building socialism (critically) not just state propaganda. The book has influenced many writers since the late 1950s, in particular Kenneth Tynan and John Berger. John Berger wrote a new introduction to the recent Verso Books edition. Fischer died on 31 July 1972 in Deutschfeistritz.

CLP Academic, 2016. Life Portret van Leonardus Lessius, unknown master, painting, collection Museum Plantin-Moretus (Antwerp) At the age of thirteen the young Leonard won the Brecht scholarship to the University of Leuven. This university is the main place he will be identified with for the next fifty years. In 1567 he matriculated in an arts department called Le Porc (Porcus alit doctos), during the final oral exam he was merited the title of primus. He joined the Jesuits in 1572, and after theological studies in Rome under Francisco Suarez and Robert Bellarmine, he became professor of theology at the University of Leuven.Leonardus Lessius, On Sales, Securities, and Insurance. CLP Academic, 2016, p.xxvii In his early teaching years, he was involved in the predestination theological debate that was raging in Leuven in 1587‚Äì88 (against Baianism). Despite significant persecution and censorship that he receive as a result, Lessius supported the view of free will and predestination developed by Luis de Molina, which was seen by many theologians at the time as too little conservative position.Leonardus Lessius, On Sales, Securities, and Insurance.

Work Leonard Lessius, De justitia et jure, Antwerp: ex officina Plantiniana, B. Moretus, 1626. Lessius is now best known for his treatise De iustitia et iure (On Justice and Law) (1605), a commentary on the Secunda secundae of Aquinas's Summa Theologica, that went through more than 20 editions in the 17th century alone.Leonardus Lessius, On Sales, Securities, and Insurance. CLP Academic, 2016, p.xxviii It is probably the first in-depth moral theological approach to economic and financial questions. Lessius went to Antwerp, then a world business centre in rapid expansion, to study how banking and commerce were functioning. His experience gave weight to his ethical solutions to moral cases dealing with business and finance. He has been praised by modern historians of economics for the subtlety of its understanding of business matters involving interest. For example, Lessius clearly states the dependence of the price of an insurance contract on the risk of the event insured against. Among other things he gave guidelines for a new \\"just price\\" approach, accepting the fact that what was proposed by Thomas Aquinas was no longer workable in the 16th century. His work On the Providence of the Deity, and the Immortality of the Soul, Against Atheists and Politicians, containing design arguments for the existence of God, was translated into English in 1631 under the title Rawleigh his Ghost. From 1610 on, and already in poor health, he turned towards writing ascetical and theological books that had also much success.

It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film at the 17th Filmfare Awards. Sharmila Tagore won her first Filmfare Best Actress Award for playing the lead role in this film. Originally released in Hindustani and dubbed in Bengali, Aradhanas huge success led to two remakes, both starring Vanisri in Tagore's role: the Tamil film Sivagamiyin Selvan (1974) and the Telugu film Kannavari Kalalu (1974). This film is counted among the 17 consecutive hit films of Rajesh Khanna between 1969 and 1971, by adding the two hero films Marayada and Andaz to the 15 consecutive solo hits he gave from 1969 to 1971. Aradhana was a blockbuster in India and the Soviet Union.https://www.cinestaan.com/articles/2018/apr/12/12464/remembering-master- screenwriter-sachin-bhowmick-ndash-death-anniversary-special The theme of the movie was based on the 1946 film To Each His Own.  Plot  In an idyllic hilly terrain, Indian Air Force officer Arun Varma (Rajesh Khanna) sings \\"Mere Sapno Ki Rani\\" atop an open jeep along with his co-pilot Madan (Sujit Kumar), while Vandana (Sharmila Tagore), the daughter of a doctor Gopal Tripathi (Pahari Sanyal) demurely sneaks glances at him from a mini train. After a brief romance, they have a secret wedding. Soon afterward, Arun dies in an air crash, leaving behind a heartbroken and pregnant Vandana. His family refuses to accept the unwed mother-to-be since her marriage with Arun was never formalised. Meanwhile, her father also dies, leaving her destitute. Vandana's son is finally born, but she is forced to let a childless couple adopt him. Determined to be a part of his life, she accepts the responsibility of becoming his nanny. The boy is named Suraj. Her employer's brother Shyam (Manmohan) arrives and lusts for Vandana. He tries to rape her when no-one is around, but Suraj arrives and stabs him to death to save Vandana. When the police arrive, Vandana takes the blame for the murder and is arrested while Suraj runs away and forgets this mishap as he grows up. Several years later, when Vandana is released from jail, she is befriended by the jailor (Madan Puri) who takes her home and introduces her to his daughter Renu (Farida Jalal). Vandana comes face to face with Suraj (Rajesh Khanna) when she discovers that Renu is dating him. Suraj, just like how his father wished, is an air-force officer. He slowly starts remembering that he has seen Vandana somewhere, although Vandana wants to hide the truth as she feels Suraj may be embarrassed upon realising his parents' background and history. Vandana makes herself at home at the jailor's house. Suraj is injured in an air crash like his real father Arun but survives. While he is recuperating in the hospital, Vandana meets Madan, who knows that Suraj is Arun and Vandana's son. He wants to tell Suraj the truth, but Vandana does not want Suraj to know that he is her son, fearing the consequences. Later when Vandana is not around, Suraj sees her diary where Arun's photo is found. Realising that Arun and Vandana are his true parents, he salutes Vandana's self-sacrificing attitude and acknowledges her publicly as his mother.

The theme of the movie was based on the 1946 film To Each His Own. A day prior to the shooting of Aradhana, producer Surinder Kapoor showed Samanta his latest film, Ek Shrimaan Ek Shrimati with Shashi Kapoor as the lead, which was also written by Sachin Bhowmick. Much to his surprise, this film had a similar ending to his own film. The following day, Samanta decided to scrap his film, when writers Gulshan Nanda and Madhusudan Kalelkar visited his office. Upon hearing the issue, it was Gulshan Nanda who suggested to have a double role of father and son in the film. Originally, the first hero was to die by the interval and a new hero was to step in. The same evening, while Aradhana was being cancelled, Nanda recited a story of Kati Patang to Samanta, which he instantly liked, so for the next couple of hours they first rewrote the second half of Aradhana, and subsequently went on to discuss Kati Patang. The \\"Roop Tera Mastana\\" song sequence, which lasted more than three minutes and 30 seconds, was filmed in a single take. Sharmila Tagore believes this was done due to time constraints.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack of the film was composed by S. D. Burman, with lyrics by Anand Bakshi. Sachin Dev Burman had written the music for the songs of Aradhana with his son, Rahul Dev Burman, and completed the recording of the songs in the voices of Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhonsle, Mohd. Rafi, Kishore Kumar and S.D. Burman himself. In \\"Roop Tera Mastana\\", Kersi Lord played the accordion, Homi Mullan played the duggi and Manohari Singh played the saxophone.

This locomotive was designed as a mixed traffic locomotive, and as such is used both in freight and passenger traffic. Technical data EU07s have driving cabs at each end of the locomotive. The locomotive is equipped with multiple unit control system, which allows a single driver to drive two coupled engines from one cab. This engine is able to pull passenger trains of up to weight with speed of and freight trains of up to weight with speed of . These figures apply to driving on level track. History The EU07 is strongly connected with the EU06 locomotive. The EU06 was a British derivative of the Class 83 locomotive built for the Polish system. In 1959 an agreement was signed with the producer of the EU06, English Electric, under which Poland bought the license for the EU06 and started its production in Pafawag Wroc≈Çaw, under build number 4E. The first item was finished in 1965, and by 1974 a total number of 240 locomotives had been built. The EU07 locomotives differed slightly from EU06 due to some minor improvements that had been made in comparison to their predecessors. In 1983 the production of EU07 locomotives was re-opened in Cegielski works in Pozna≈Ñ. This new series of locomotives was based on ET41 freight locomotive (which had been built by joining together two EU07 locomotives of first run production). Bringing several modifications production number changed to 303E. A total number of 243 locomotives were built and the production continued until 1994 despite relatively outdated construction. =Modifications= All EU07 locomotives were originally fitted with large headlights the buckets. After 1990 these have been successively replaced with halogen headlights of smaller diameter. The cheapest such replacement was to put the new headlight inside the bucket. More elaborate changes included cutting the bucket out and creating flat headlight for better aerodynamic performance. EP07 is a later modification of EU07, with changed motors and gear ratios to make them better suited for hauling passenger trains. Modification has been made in several Rolling Stock Repairing Works since 1995. EP07 locomotives change only class name, but not the serial number. EU07A is a very comprehensive modification of EU07 encompassing new motors, power electronics, new brake system, etc. Originally, after evaluating test results, PKP Intercity made a decision not to modify any further units due to unsatisfactory costs versus results ratio but in 2012 ordered further two units. These were delivered in 2014.

Biography Rabbi Nathansohn was born at Berezhany (Berzan), Galicia (today's western Ukraine); he was the son of Aryeh Lebush Nathanson, rabbi at Berzan and author of \\"Bet El.\\" He studied Talmud at Lviv (Lemberg) together with his brother-in-law Mordecai Zeeb Ettinger. In the 1830s in Lemberg‚Äîthen under the rule of the Austrian Empire‚Äîhe founded an informal study-group under his tutelage; this yeshiva attracted some of the most brilliant students in Galicia. In 1857 Nathanson was elected rabbi of Lemberg, where he officiated for eighteen years. He was a widely recognized rabbinical authority, and was asked to rule on various contemporary issues; his rulings are still widely cited (for instance he was one of the first to permit the use of machinery in baking Matzah, which created a widespread halachic controversy';Codex Judaica'; by M. Kantor, 2005, p.267). Nathanson was very wealthy, and was known for his activity as a philanthropist. He died in Lemberg March 4, 1875, with no descendants.

The novel presents a series of moral vignettes which the na√Øve protagonist Harley either observes, is told about, or participates in. This novel is often seen to contain elements of the Romantic novel, which became prolific in the years following its publishing. Background The Man of Feeling, Mackenzie's first and most famous novel, was begun in London in 1767.Mackenzie, Henry. The Man of Feeling, edited by Brian Vickers (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009) It was published in April 1771, sold out by the beginning of June, and reached its sixth edition by 1791. Mackenzie wrote The Man of Feeling in the latter half of the eighteenth century, by the end of which the concept of sentimentalism had steadily become merely laughable and entertaining.Mullan, John. ‚ÄòSentimental Novels‚Äô, in The Cambridge Companion to the Eighteenth Century Novel, edited by John Richetti (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) An 'Index to Tears', which was first included in the 1886 edition of The Man of Feeling edited by Professor Henry Morley, indicates how the \\"repertory of sentimental effects...has become a repertory of mirthful effects, perhaps to be read aloud in the Victorian parlour to an audience only needing to hear these categories of tears in order to trigger a rather different physical response.\\" Whilst in the reaction to sentimentalism authors and readers alike satirised or humiliated characters with an excess of emotion, there remained those who supported elements of the genre. According to theorist Hugh Blair, the man of feeling ‚Äúlives in a different sort of world from what the selfish man inhabits. He possesses a new sense, which enables him to behold objects which the selfish man cannot see.‚ÄùVan Sant, Ann Jessie. Eighteenth-Century Sensibility and the Novel: The Senses in Social Context (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004) Mackenzie experienced difficulty in getting The Man of Feeling published, until he finally managed to have it published anonymously. A priest by the name of Eccles made an attempt to claim authorship, supported by \\"a manuscript full of changes and erasures\\" in his possession.Henry Mackenzie Plot summary The Man of Feeling details the fragmentary episodes of the life of Harley which exist within the remains of a manuscript traded to the initial narrator of the novel by a priest. The novel itself begins with these two latter figures hunting, whereas the manuscript is missing the first ten chapters and approximately thirty others at various locations throughout the manuscript's entirety. As a young boy, Harley loses his parents and is assigned several guardians who constantly disagree with each other. They do however agree that he should make an effort to acquire more wealth, and so they urge him to make an old distant relative amiable towards him to claim some inheritance. Harley fails in this endeavour, as he doesn't cooperate with the relative's attempts to warm to him. Harley is then advised to acquire a patron; to sell his vote at an election for a lease of land. His neighbour Mr. Walton gives him a letter of introduction, and he leaves home (and Miss Walton) for London. He meets a beggar and his dog on the way, and after donating to them, hears the fortune-telling beggar's story. In the following (missing) chapters, Harley formally visits the baronet Mr. Walton recommended him to, because when the narrative continues, Harley is calling on him for the second time. The baronet however is away from London, and Harley meets another gentleman named Tom. They go for a stroll and then dine together, discussing pensions and resources with two older men. Harley proceeds to visit Bedlam, and weeps for an inmate there, before dining with a scorned, cynical man and together they discuss honour and vanity. He then demonstrates his skill (or, as many argue, his lack of skill) in physiognomy by being charitable on behalf of an old gentleman, with whom Harley later plays cards. After losing money to them, Harley is informed the gentleman and his acquaintance are con men. Approached by a prostitute, Harley takes her to a tavern and feeds her, despite having to hand the waiter his pocket watch as collateral for paying the bill, and then meets again with her the next morning to hear her story. At its conclusion her father arrives, and after a misunderstanding is reconciled with his daughter. Upon discovering that his claim for the land lease has failed, Harley takes a stage-coach back home, discussing poetry and vice with a fellow passenger until they part ways and the coach reaches the end of its route. Harley continues on foot, and along the way meets Edwards, an old farmer from his village who has fallen on hard times and is returning from his conscription in the army. Together they approach the village, to find the school house destroyed, and two orphans who are actually the grandchildren of Harley's companion. Harley takes the three of them home, and provides some land for them. After discussing corrupt military commanders with Edwards, Harley is informed to his dismay that Miss Walton is going to be married to Sir Harry Benson. The Man of Feeling then jumps to an unconnected tale of a man named Mountford, who journeys to Milan as tutor to the young Sedley, where they meet with a count. They visit a debtors' prison to find a man and his family living there at the behest of the count's son, a man who had been so charming to the two gentlemen. Sedley pays the family's debt, and then Mountford and Sedley leave Milan in disgust. Jamie is then renowned as the 'Man of Feeling' and is distressed to find that his entry is no longer there. The narrative returns to the story of Harley. Miss Walton has not married Benson. She visits an unwell Harley (who has contracted a fever nursing Edwards and his grandchildren), who confesses his love to her. They hold hands and he dies. Literary style Typical of sentimental fiction, The Man of Feeling is fragmented; chapters and passages are missing, although this is contrived, as the narrative is still comprehensible. Mackenzie highlights these absences, by implying the contents of the non-existent chapters, by chapter numbering (indicating gaps) or through the sudden introduction of characters: \\"Peter stood at the door. We have mentioned this faithful fellow formerly\\". The fragmentary nature of the text narrates \\"the sensibility that is inevitably expressed in moments.\\"Janet Todd, Sensibility: An Introduction (London: Methuen, 1986)) It allows for elisions and hiatuses, so that content not evoking the sentimental can be excluded from the text entirely. The transient nature of manuscript itself is further alluded to in the Introduction; the manuscript depicting Harley's life is being used as wadding for the curate's gun. Harley's aunt also employs a book to help fold her linen. References Further reading * G. J.

The Act was designed to improve and protect the rights of females in Singapore and to guarantee greater legal equality for women in legally sanctioned relationships (except in the area of Muslims marriages, which are governed separately by the Administration of Muslim Law Act). Among other things, the Act provides for the institution of monogamous marriages, the rights of husbands and wives in marriage, the protection of the family, and the legal potentialities with regard to divorce and separation. Overview The Women's Charter was successfully campaigned for by Madam Chan Choy Siong, wife of Ong Pang Boon, a former Cabinet Minister of Singapore. The Women's Charter was largely based on existing legislation. Parts III to X in the main re-enacted the Civil Marriage Ordinance, the Married Women's Property Ordinance, the Married Women and Children (Maintenance) Ordinance, the Maintenance (Facilities for Enforcement) Ordinance, the Divorce Ordinance and the Women and Girls Protection Ordinance. Part II, which \\"seeks to provide that any person who is already lawfully married under any law, religion, custom or usage shall during the continuance of such marriage be incapable of contracting any further marriage\\", was largely new.Women's Charter Bill (No 126 of 1961), Explanatory Statement. Since 1997, divorcing couples have had to file a parenting plan that includes arrangements on custody, access to the child, and provisions for the child's education needs. Latest amendments to the Charter were passed firstly in January 2011 that introduced provisions to facilitate marriages in Singapore, address divorce and its impact and strengthen the enforcement of maintenance orders. Amendments were passed again on 29 February 2016 after being proposed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development: *Beginning 1 October 2016, the mandatory Marriage Preparation Programme is extended to all marriages in which at least one party is below the age of 21. *By end 2016, a two-hour mandatory parenting counselling is necessitated for divorcing parents with at least one child younger than 14 yet disagree on divorce matters. This regulation may eventually be extended to include divorcing parents with at least one child younger than 21. *Men can now apply for maintenance but unlike women, they can seek maintenance only if they are incapacitated, i.e. unable to support themselves whether due to illness or disability. Previously, only women could apply for alimony from their former spouse in Singapore whereas men could not. *Maintenance record officers that can get information on divorcing parties' finances are introduced in helping the courts identify recalcitrant defaulters of and impose harsher penalties against them. This takes aim at these defaulters by reducing the burden of proof of women to show their husbands' or former husbands' finances. *Beginning March 2016, after divorce, parents who have children under 21 and agree on all divorce matters must attend a two-hour programme on issues such as co-parenting and self-care skills. *Greater protection for those affected by family violence as well as the staff of homes and shelters. In the case of an ugly divorce, by end 2016 a judge can summon a counsellor presence in supervising meet ups between a child and the parent without custody. *Voiding of marriages of convenience as defined under the Immigration Act Uses and Concerns Around one in five marriages on the island ends in divorce. Court figures also show that there were 6,017 divorce cases in 2014, a 45 per cent rise from 2000. Custody battles are also of significant concern in recent times. In 2013, there were 1,700 court applications for enforcement orders compelling former spouses to maintain their ex-partners and children. This compares to 1,900 in 2009, before harsher penalties were introduced in 2011. By April 2014, there was an average of 118 orders each year for employers to directly pay out maintenance from defaulters' salaries. In December 2015, the Association of Women for Action and Research made a proposition that the Women's Charter be renamed as Family Charter instead. Critics also regard the Charter as having transformed from being a safeguard for disadvantaged women into a method of discriminating against men.

The club is named after Salamis (or Salamina), an ancient city near present- day Famagusta. Nea Salamis Famagusta fields teams in men's football and volleyball, and formerly fielded teams in women's football, track and field, water sports and table tennis. Since the 1974 Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus, Nea Salamina has been a refugee team based in Larnaca. The men's football team, founded in 1948 and based at Ammochostos Stadium in Larnaka, is the club's oldest; its high points were winning the 1990 Cypriot and Cypriot Super Cups. The men's volleyball team is one of the most successful teams in Cyprus. With 9 championships, 8 cups and 8 Super Cups it is the second team in trophies. The ground of the team is in Limassol, the indoor athletic arena Spyros Kyprianou Athletic Center. History =Early years= Nea Salamis was founded at the time of the Greek Civil War. The situation in Greece affected Cyprus, influencing politics and sport; most athletes were also involved in politics. At that time, Famagusta had two sports clubs: the Evagoras Gymnastics Association, or GSE, () and the Anorthosis Famagusta FC. GSE had many leftist athletes (some of the best in Cyprus) on its roster, and many of Anorthosis' players were also leftists. In the right-wing political climate of the time, both clubs began restricting the admission of leftist players or denying them promotion. Additionally, Anorthosis was hosting at their clubhouse the right-wing Cypriot National Party. In early 1947 a group of leftists, members and of GSE and Anorthosis and some other people from Famagusta agreed on the need for another sport club which would appeal to all, regardless of political affiliation. On 14 February 1948 a decision was made to establish the club, and the New Salamis sports club was formed on 7 March 1948 as the first leftist athletic club in Cyprus. After the club was founded, demand was high to join. The football team was not strong at that time, since most of the players were untalented. Cinema Hadjichambi, where Nea Salamina Famagusta was founded in Famagusta in 1948 On 8 March 1948, the newspaper Democratis reported the club's establishment in a story titled, \\"A Progressive Movement in Varosha\\": > Today at 11 a.m. in Hadjihambis theater the founding convention of a new > sport club in our city, New Salamina took place. The board of directors > consisted of Messrs. Andrew Paschalides, Georgio Fano, doctor, and Kostas > Eleftheriou. Mr. G. Fanos stressed that the most progressive city of the > island, Famagusta, hasn't had a political free sport club. He also > emphasized the association's program as leading the city in cultural and > sportive terms and invited all professionals and amateurs to join the new > club. Nine board members were elected: * Andreas Paschalidis (Chair) * George Fanos (Vice-president) * Kostas Eleftheriou (General Secretary) * Michael Daniel Sialis (Treasurer) * Antonis Totsis (Collector) * Lycurgus Archontides (Football head) * Nikos Kokkinos (Football head) * Panagiotis Kalogirou (Track head) =Name= The new club was named \\"Nea Salamis\\", based on a suggestion by Evagoras Lanitis. Lanitis came to the GSŒï stadium during Pancypriot games, and said Anorthosis should be renamed \\"Salamis\\" in honor of ancient Salamis. A club founder remembered the suggestion, proposed it and it was adopted as \\"Athletic Club 'Nea Salamis' Famagusta\\" (; nea means \\"new\\" in Greek). =Teams= Many people soon joined the new club, creating track and football teams for young athletes. Although the club had a track team, the football department coordinated all events. The first Nea Salamis track meet was the Famagusta races on 25 March 1948 at the GSE stadium, at which the club was victorious. Participants included Nikis Georgiou, Panayiotis Kalogirou, Antonis Totsis, Koumis Kkeses, Kostas Manoli, Nikos Kokkinos and Christofi Tsiakkiros. The track team was successful because GSE's top track athletes joined Nea Salamis, but the football team was not strong because few players from Anorthosis had joined Nea Salamis. =Expulsion from GSE Stadium and founding of CAFF= Before the May 1948 Pancyprian Games, the Hellenic Amateur Athletic Association (SEGAS) asked all sports clubs in Cyprus to publicly support the rightists in the Greek Civil War, espousing \\"nationalist beliefs\\" and condemning the leftists. The rightist athletic clubs and athletes signed the statement; the only club which refused was the \\"Kinyras\\" Paphos Gymnastic Association, which was excluded from the games. The leftist athletes, opposed to the declaration by the clubs, refused to sign the statement. Among the first athletes who reacted were GSE champions Antonis Totsis () and Nikis Georgiou (ŒùŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒìŒµœâœÅŒ≥ŒØŒøœÖ). Although the GSE asked the athletes to apologize, both insisted that sports should remain separate from politics. Totsis and Georgiou also decided to support the \\"Kinyras\\" Paphos Gymnastic Association if the decision excluding it from the Pancyprian Games was unchanged. They held to their position, and although the GSE was favored in the games it finished third. Nea Salamis did not participate in the Pancyprian Games, and the GSE president informed the club by mail that it was barred from the GSE Stadium. Nea Salamis hadn' t stadium for the new season. Leftist athletes were also persecuted in other Cypriot cities. In Larnaca, Alki Larnaca F.C. was founded in April 1948; the following month, the Gymnastic Club Zeno (GSZ) banned Alki from using its GSZ Stadium; a similar proposal excluding Turks and Catholics was rejected. At the same meeting, GSZ members amended its constitution to prohibit the future enrollment of new members unless they signed a declaration that \\"they espouse Hellenic nationalistic ideals\\". This excluded leftist athletes from becoming members or using its stadium. In May, Orfeas Nicosia was founded in Nicosia; that month, APOEL F.C. sent a telegram to SEGAS with \\"cordial brotherly greetings to the entire Greek youth athletes\\" for the National Games and hoping for an end to intra-nation mutiny. APOEL asked its members and athletes to sign a declaration supporting the telegram's content. Leftist APOEL members and athletes \\"intra-nation mutiny\\" a political challenge issued by the club, and distanced themselves from the statement. The Cypriot press created a hostile climate with articles and commentary. This was followed by an indefinite suspension of five APOEL athletes, who founded AC Omonia in June 1948 with former APOEL members. After that, AS Kyrenia was founded. The members of the new clubs were not accepted in the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) due to their leftist sympathies, and founded the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation (CAFF) in December 1948. CAFF organized leagues and cups, attracting thousands of fans; CAFF matches attracted more fans than those of the CFA. Six clubs belonged to the new league: Nea Salamis Famagusta, Omonia and Orfeas in Nicosia, Alki at Larnaca, AMOL at Limassol (renamed Antaeus in 1951) and Neos Asteras in Morphou. =Unification of Cypriot football= Cypriot football, between Nea Salamis and Anorthosis at GSE Stadium in Famagusta Fans at the first game Although the CAFF clubs favored the unification of Cypriot football, they were repeatedly rejected over a three-year period by the CFA. The existence of two football federations and two championships was unprecedented in Cyprus. The situation created economic and infrastructure problems, preventing the sport's development in the country. The CAFF clubs also felt that sports should be based on friendship rather than segregation. In December 1952, the first edition of the sports newspaper Athlitiki launched a crusade for the unification of Cypriot football which was supported by the foreign coaches of CFA clubs. According to the CFA, \\"[The coaches'] statements opposed the spirit of the Federation\\". During the summer of 1953, most Cypriot sportspeople supported unification. In August 1953, Nea Salamis, Omonia, Alki and Antaeus submitted a joint application to join the CFA's First Division. On 19 September the association accepted Nea Salamis and Omonia as members. However, the organization's negative attitude towards those clubs continued. First, the league rejected applications from Alki, Orfeas Nicosia and Neos Asteras (although the first two joined a year later), and second, arguing that according to its constitution, only one team must participate in the Cypriot First Division and two teams in the second division. The CAFF clubs accepted the conditions in the interest of unification. At an ad hoc meeting, CAFF members agreed that Omonia would join the First Division and Nea Salamis and Antaeus the Second Division. After this, the federation disbanded. The first game between teams from the rival leagues was a friendly between Nea Salamis and Anorthosis at GSE Stadium on 27 September 1953 before a crowd of 5,200. Anorthosis won, 3‚Äì1, and Athlitiki praised the fans' sportsmanship and brotherhood. =Famagusta municipal stadium= Famagusta municipal stadium, used by Nea Salamis for training until 1974 and its home ground for the 1952‚Äì53 season When Nea Salamis was barred from GSE Stadium, the club had nowhere to play. Initially practicing at the Saint Lukas (\\"Proodou\\") court in Famagusta, it began efforts to build a privately owned stadium. In December 1948, Israel donated three thousand pounds to Famagusta for a community project in gratitude to the city's residents for help offered to Jewish refugees. Famagusta alderman and Nea Salamis footballer Gabriel Makris supported a stadium, and the city council acknowledged \\"financial assistance granted by the Jews to create Municipal Sports Stadium, which is available to Famagustans for the promotion and spread of mass popular sport.\\" The stadium would be available to Nea Salamis and any other sports club. In early 1949, construction began with volunteer labor on a municipal stadium in Saint John's parish in Famagusta. The stadium, the first in Cyprus with a roofed grandstand, was completed in 1952 and was Nea Salamis' home ground in 1952 and 1953. In 1953, after unification of Cyprus' football, Nea Salamina started using GSE Stadium. The Famagusta municipal stadium was used by the team only for training until 1974. That year, when Famagusta was occupied by the Turkish army, the club moved its headquarters in Larnaka. =Refugees and reactivation= A tragic day in Nea Salamis' history was the 14 August 1974 occupation of Famagusta by Turkish troops as a result of the invasion of Cyprus, which made it a refugee club. The city remains in Turkish hands, and fans and players scattered to free areas of Cyprus or abroad. Although while Cypriots struggled to adjust to the occupation sports were a low priority, club members tried to maintain its presence. In September 1974 board members Kostas Nikolaos, Nikis Georgiou, Dimos Fotiou and Panayiotis Kalogirou met, deciding to convene a meeting of the full board. Since most board members were in Limassol, the meeting was held in the Aris Limassol F.C. clubhouse on 14 October 1974 with eight of eleven board members present; the other three were abroad. In attendance were Nicholaou Costas (chair), Pantelakis Vasileiou, Dimos Fotiou, Panagiotis Kalogirou, Pambos Charalambous, Christakis Polyviou, Giorgaros Kythreotis and Makis Constantinou, who decided to reactivate Nea Salamis. Since most of the players were in Larnaca, it was decided that the Alki Larnaca F.C. clubhouse would be Nea Salamis' temporary home. In late 1974, the CFA decided to play a championship season. Although the Nea Salamis board disagreed on whether to play because of their refugee status, they decided to participate‚Äînot so much to win as to keep the team in First Division. There were many problems; Nea Salamis' football fans were scattered across Cyprus, the team no longer had equipment nor a place to train. Without a permanent home, Nea Salamis used the GSZ Stadium for the 1974‚Äì75 season. Players of the team lived in various Cypriot cities, and many had been conscripted by the military due to the tense situation on the island. Board members traveled at their own expense across Cyprus, transporting players from Larnaca and the military camps for workouts and matches on day trips. In January 1975, Nea Salamis rented a building. The team's expenses were covered at first by contributions from members and friends of the club. Two teams were formed to train young players; the first, in Larnaca, was managed by former team member Andreas Konteatis (followed by Nikis Georgiou) and assisted by Nikos Pitsiaoulos. The second team, in Limassol, was trained by Mavrikios Asprou. In 1975 Georgiou proposed a volleyball team in Limassol, since most of Nea Salamis' volleyball supporters were there after 1974, and it was created the following year. =Emblem, colors and anthem= The club's emblem is a red-and-white Olympic flame on a shield with the five Olympic rings in red. Nea Salamis' first colors were yellow and red, worn for two years in the CAFF. After 1950, the club's governing council changed the team's colors to red and white: red for power, and white for peace. Red jerseys with white stripes were chosen because they resembled those worn by Olympiakos Piraeus. Nea Salamis' anthem, translated from the Greek, is: Football 1990 Cypriot Cup final at Tsirion Stadium in Limassol 2001 Cypriot Cup final at GSP Stadium Men's football is Nea Salamis' principal and longest-running program, and the team's home ground is Ammochostos Stadium. Its high point was winning the 1990 Cypriot Cup and Cypriot Super Cups, and the team's highest position in the Cypriot First Division was third. During the first five years after Nea Salamis was founded (1948‚Äì1953) the team played in the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation, joining the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) in 1953. It has played for more than 50 years in the Cypriot First Division, the seventh-highest tenure in the league. Nea Salamis has finished third four times, and has played in three cup finals. Nea Salamis Famagusta played Aberdeen in the 1990‚Äì91 European Cup Winners' Cup at Tsirion Stadium. As a cup winner Nea Salamis played its first European Cup match in 1990, but was eliminated in the first round by Aberdeen F.C.. In the first game, at Tsirion Stadium on 19 September 1990 before 8,000 fans, Nea Salamina lost 2‚Äì0 after a scoreless first half. At Pittodrie Stadium in Aberdeen on 3 October 1990, Nea Salamis again lost 3‚Äì0. The team played in the 1995 and 1997 UEFA Intertoto Cups, but was eliminated both years in the first round. In the 2000 UEFA Intertoto Cup Nea Salamis advanced to the second round, defeating KS Vllaznia Shkod√´r twice and FK Austria Wien in Cyprus before losing 3‚Äì0 in Vienna. The 1965‚Äì66 team The 1965‚Äì66 season had high and low points for the club. According to witnesses and contemporary newspapers, Nea Salamis played the best football in Cyprus. Beginning the season with consecutive wins, the team was in first place until the last game of the season and lost its first cup final. In a game with APOEL at GSP Stadium in Nicosia, Nea Salamis led 3‚Äì0. In the 62nd minute, an APOEL player struck a Nea Salamis player; when the assailant was ejected, a fan grabbed the assistant referee's flag and the referee stopped the game. After three weeks, a CFA tribunal decided to replay the match, and Nea Salamis won the replay. Before the season's next-to-last game, Omonia and Nea Salamis were tied for first place with Olympiakos Nicosia one point behind. In the game with Olympiakos, Nea Salamis led 2‚Äì1 when the referee added generous stoppage time; after clashes during the final seconds, the game was halted and the CFA tribunal decided to replay the match with the standings Omonia (50 points), Nea Salamina (47) and Olympiakos (46). If Nea Salamis had defeated Olympiakos, they would have won the championship with a better goal difference than Omonia. On 31 May 1966 Nea Salamis' fans traveled from Famagusta to Nicosia, but Nea Salamis lost 6‚Äì3. Its defense, the best in the league (allowing 15 goals in 19 games), allowed six in the game and the team finished third for the second time. After the defeat some players left the team, and despite being favored in the cup final over Apollon Limassol Nea Salamis lost 4‚Äì2. During the season, the team had the best defense in the league‚Äî21 goals in 20 games‚Äîfor the first (and only) time. =Women's team= In 2006, Nea Salamis began a women's football program. Its team finished third in the 2006‚Äì07 Cypriot First Division and qualified for the cup final, which it lost 3‚Äì1 to AEK Kokkinochorion at GSP Stadium. That year the team won the Super Cup, defeating AEK Kokkinochorion 2‚Äì1 at Ammochostos Stadium in Larnaca. The women's program was curtailed in 2010 for economic reasons. =Ammochostos Stadium= Ammochostos Stadium Nea Salamis' home ground until the 1974 occupation was GSE Stadium in Famagusta. The 5,000-seat Ammochostos Stadium in Larnaca, owned by the club, is used primarily for football and houses the club offices. The stadium is named for the town of Famagusta (; Ammochostos), and was built in 1991 near the refugee camps. The decision to build the stadium was made in 1989; construction began in December of that year, and with the aid of club supporters in Cyprus and abroad, the Cyprus Sports Organisation and volunteer labor it was completed on schedule. The first Nea Salamis Famagusta game at the new stadium was on 12 October 1991 against Evagoras Paphos; Nea Salamis won, 4‚Äì1. The stadium hosted the 1992 UEFA European Under-16 Championship final on 17 May 1992 between Germany and Spain, which Germany won 2‚Äì1. Volleyball =Men's team= Nea Salamis celebrating its 2012‚Äì13 Cyprus Volleyball Division 1 championship at the Spyros Kyprianou Athletic Center The Nea Salamis Famagusta men's volleyball team of is one of the best in Cyprus. With nine championships, eight cups and eight super cups, it has the second-largest number of trophies after Anorthosis Famagusta FC. The team's home is the indoor Spyros Kyprianou Athletic Center in Limassol. Nea Salamis, 2010‚Äì11 Division 1 champions, at Apollon Stadium From its early days Nea Salamis Famagusta has supported a volleyball program, and since 1954 the club has organized popular amateur summer leagues and championships. Participants have included Anorthosis Famagusta FC, the Anagennisi Dherynia, Marathon Kato Varosha and ENAD Agios Memnon. In 1975 Nikis Georgiou proposed creating a volleyball team in Limassol to preserve the club since many Nea Salamis fans moved there after the occupation the year before. The volleyball team (created in 1976) is one of 20 charter members of the Cyprus Volleyball Federation, which was founded in 1978. In Nea Salamis' first Cyprus Volleyball Division 1 season the team finished second, also finishing second in 1981 and 1982. In 1981, they lost the championship on a points difference. In 1983 Nea Salamis won its first club-level cup final, defeating Anorthosis 3‚Äì1. The team won its first championship (and its second cup) in 1989‚Äì90, followed by another championship the next season and a cup the season after that. From 1998 to 2003 Nea Salamis, coached by Antonis Constantinou, won a record six consecutive championships. The last four were trebles, with the team winning the championship, the cup and the super cup. In addition to its victories, the team has been a cup finalist six times. The team, with many European players, qualified for the round of 16 in the 2011‚Äì12 Challenge Cup (its greatest success). =Women's team= In 1978 the club decided to create a women's team in Limassol, first to give women an opportunity to play and secondly to preserve the club. Its first coach was Nikis Georgiou. After the 1984‚Äì85 season the board suspended the team for financial reasons, although it was a cup finalist. In seven years, the women's team finished second three times (1980‚Äì81, 1981‚Äì82 and 1982‚Äì83) and was a cup finalist three times (1979‚Äì80, 1982‚Äì83 and 1984‚Äì85). =Youth teams= Nea Salamis has under-19, under-17 and under-15 teams. The U19 team has won a league-record nine championships, the U17 team a league-record eight and the U15 team a league-record seven. The U19 team has also won a record six cups. Track and field Until 1974 Nea Salamis had a track-and-field program. The club's track team was founded by Cypriot champions Nikis Georgiou and Antonis Totsis, who had been expelled from the GSE. Nea Salamis won its first track meet in March 1948 (days after the club's founding), the Famagusta provincial meet, and finished second in 1952 and 1958. In 1970, when Cypriot club meets began, Nea Salamis finished fifth out of thirteen teams; the club was third in 1971 and 1972. In 1973 and 1974 (the last Cypriot club races), Nea Salamis finished fourth. Other activities Before 1974 Nea Salamis had other sports programs, competing locally in swimming, boating and table tennis. The club also had an active role in Famagusta's cultural life with outdoor dance performances, theatrical events and marching in holiday parades. London and New York clubs In 1971, a group of Nea Salamina fans living in London founded New Salamis in honor of their team in Cyprus. Nea Salamina London maintains close ties with Nea Salamina, with some Famagusta players coming from London. New York Salamina S.C., a Greek Cypriot football club founded in 1999 in New York City by New York Cypriot supporters of Nea Salamis Famagusta, plays in local amateur leagues. Relations with Turkish Cypriots Since its founding, Nea Salamis sought to develop friendly relations with the Turkish Cypriot community of Famagusta; an important element was the acceptance of Turkish Cypriots on the team. During the early 1950s, several Turkish Cypriot footballers (including Siekkeris, Nita and Moustafa) joined Nea Salamis. When the team joined the Cyprus Football Association it struggled for two seasons in the second division, playing Turkish Cypriot clubs including Demir Sports, Kenslik Kiounslou and the Turkish Club of Famagusta. When Turkish Cypriot clubs began withdrawing from CFA tournaments in late 1955, Nea Salamis tried to convince them to remain and Turkish players were still welcome in the club. In 1962 Kallikas was transferred to Nea Salamis, and in 1970 Neziak (of Turkish origin) was transferred to the club. In 2004 the Turkish Cypriots Imam and Oulousoi were transferred to Nea Salamina, the first Turkish Cypriot footballers to play in the CAF in thirty years. On 26 March 2005 Nea Salamis played a friendly football match against the Turkish Cypriot Yenicami at Ammochostos Stadium, winning 6‚Äì0; it was the first match between a Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot club in a half-century. The 2,500 fans sat together in the stands, sending a message of peace, and the match was attended by representatives of the political leadership of both communities, local sportspeople and the church.

They are rebuilt EU07 class locomotives, which in turn are the direct successors to the post-war British EU06 series locomotives. The only operators of this locomotive series are PKP Intercity and Polregio. These locomotives constitute the vast majority of electric locomotives still serving the PKP Group today - they are used to drive both light and heavy passenger trains. History Since 1995, some EU07 locomotives have undergone a reconstruction, in which new traction motors with a higher permissible operating temperature - LKb535 were installed and the gear-ratio was changed from 79:18 to 76:21. Modifications were carried out, among others..: ZNTK Ole≈õnica, ZNTK Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki, HCP Pozna≈Ñ, \\"Newag\\" Nowy SƒÖcz. The change of gear ratio did not, however, increase the design speed (misaligned transmission system - hollow shaft bearing on slide bearings), but decreased the engine speed, making it difficult to drive freight trains with this locomotive. It has become easier to maintain the maximum speed of the locomotive while reducing breakdowns. Starting acceleration has also increased - especially at higher speeds, which is realized with less weakening of the excitation (and thus higher motor power). The new LKb535 traction motors, instead of EE541, are adapted to the higher permissible operating temperature. The maximum permitted engine speed for EE541b is 2390 rpm, for EU07 series locomotives with maximum axle rims and 120 km/h, traction engines reach 2380 rpm and EP07 engines in the same situation only reach 1962 rpm, which increases their durability. The rebuilt units kept their rolling stock number (e.g. the EU07-330 locomotive became the EP07-330 locomotive). In December 2006, 74 EP07 and EU07 class locomotives belonging to PKP Cargo were sold to PKP Przewozy Regionalne. These locomotives have been modernized, the main transmission in EU07 has been changed. In addition, they received new livery, control sockets were dismantled, driver's cabs received thermal and acoustic insulation and new driver's and assistant's seats, and electric wipers and halogen headlights were installed. The locomotives have been renumbered from 1001 upwards. In the years 2012-2013 5 EU07 of Przewozy Regionalne was rebuilt to EP07P type, they received a new numbering from 2001 onwards. The modernization included installation of static converter, WN and NN cabinets, new panels in driver's cabins, air conditioning and repair of traction motors. On the front a diode display was installed.

He played five Test matches and one One Day International for England in the early 1970s. Life and career Shuttleworth made his first-class cricket debut in 1964 when he was aged nineteen, tall, raw, but genuinely a fast bowler. He took fifty wickets in 1967, but really started to burst through in 1968, when Brian Statham was fading from the scene. His best season was in 1970, when he took seventy-four wickets at 21.60 runs each, and played for England against The Rest of the World, at Lord's. He went to Australia with Ray Illingworth's Ashes-winning team and started his Test career with five for 47 at Brisbane. He played five times in all for England - four of them that winter in Australia and New Zealand, the other against Pakistan in 1971 - and took twelve wickets at 35.58 each. Despite having a bowling action to rival Fred Trueman's, Shuttleworth was a great worrier, and when not taking wickets regularly tinkered with his technique. Shuttleworth's career never took off as it might have done and loss of form, plus persistent injuries, forced him to leave Lancashire in 1975 and join Leicestershire, where he played forty-one matches between 1977 and 1980.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 9, 1993. In the episode, a female employee named Mindy is hired at the nuclear power plant. Homer and Mindy find themselves attracted to each other after bonding over their shared interests of beer, donuts and television. Although Homer is tempted to sleep with Mindy, he remains faithful to his wife Marge. Meanwhile, Bart becomes an outcast after medical treatments make him look like a nerd. The episode was written by Frank Mula and directed by Carlos Baeza. It features cultural references to films such as The Wizard of Oz, It's A Wonderful Life, and A Christmas Carol. It did not get the usual amount of laughs at the test screenings, which made the staff worry the show was not as funny as they expected. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics; guest star Michelle Pfeiffer was especially praised for her performance as Mindy, which was highlighted on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 16 best guest appearances on The Simpsons. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.7, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot After Homer and his coworkers barely escape from a gas leak at the nuclear power plant, Homer's coworker is fired when he asks Mr. Burns to put in a real emergency exit. When Burns breaks numerous labor laws in hiring a replacement -- such as hiring undocumented workers and ducks -- the United States Department of Labor demands that he hire at least one female worker. A beautiful woman, Mindy Simmons, is hired and Homer falls in love with her. Barney advises Homer to talk to Mindy because they will most likely have nothing in common. To his horror, Homer finds they have exactly the same interests. Marge gets sick with a bad cold, which makes her unattractive to Homer. Bart is sent to an eye doctor after the school discovers he has poor vision. The optometrist finds he has lazy eye and fits him with thick glasses he must wear for two weeks. A dermatologist treats Bart's dry scalp by matting his hair down with a medicated salve, parting his hair to both sides. He receives a pair of oversized shoes from the podiatrist to help his posture, and the otolaryngologist sprays his throat, making him sound like Jerry Lewis from The Nutty Professor. These changes make Bart look and sound like a nerd, causing school bullies to pick on him. Bart eventually returns to school in his normal guise after his treatments end, but the bullies pummel him anyway. Homer decides to tell Mindy they should avoid each other because of their mutual attraction. However, they are chosen to represent the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant at the National Energy Convention in Capital City. After a romantic dinner as an award for winning the convention, Homer and Mindy return to their hotel room. Mindy tells Homer how she feels about him, but assures him that he can decide how far their relationship will go. Although he is very tempted by her, Homer declares his faithfulness to Marge. Mindy accepts his decision and leaves after they share a kiss. Later, Marge and Homer share a romantic evening together in the same room, where Homer discovers a turkey he and Mindy left behind the bed after ordering room service. Production The idea of the episode came from alt=A seated man wearing a cap smiles as he looks into the distance. His hands are crossed. The episode was written by Frank Mula and directed by Carlos Baeza. The idea was conceived by the then-show runner David Mirkin. When he was hired to work on The Simpsons, one of his goals was to study the aspect of Homer's character if he was \\"really tempted away\\" from Marge. Mirkin wanted to find out what would happen in a situation where Homer finds himself attracted to another woman. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had previously written an episode for the show's third season, called \\"Colonel Homer\\", where Homer finds himself attracted to a country singer named Lurleen Lumpkin. In that episode, Lurleen immediately had a \\"crush\\" on Homer, but Homer was not aware of it until later on. With this episode, Mirkin wanted Homer to immediately know he was attracted to Mindy. Mirkin thought it was a \\"great exploration\\" to see what happened to Homer in this particular case. The episode did not get the usual amount of laughs at the animatic test screening, which made the staff worry it was not as funny as they expected. Mirkin said it had to do with the fact that because there were very \\"subtle\\" performances in the episode, the animation had to be \\"exactly right\\" for it to be funny. Baeza and David Silverman, another animation director on the show, worked \\"hard\\" on the episode. Mirkin said from the very beginning it was a \\"huge group effort\\" from both the writing and the animation staff. Many scenes in the animatic portrayed Mindy as flirty. Mirkin did not like this because the secret of the episode was Homer and Mindy are two good people who are thrown into the situation and \\"can't help that their libidos are going crazy upon seeing each other\\". He added that the two characters have \\"so much in common\\" that it is \\"not just a physical relationship, but a mental connection as well\\", and that Mindy is not a seductress but rather a woman just as nervous as Homer. Mirkin also pointed out that while Homer is being tempted by a \\"seemingly perfect\\" woman at work, his wife could not be more \\"imperfect\\" since she has got a cold and looks sick. \\"He's trying to connect with his family, but with Marge looking sick and Bart looking like a nerd, everything is just not working,\\" Mirkin said. Michelle Pfeiffer guest starred in the episode as the voice of Mindy Simmons. Mirkin praised her performance as being \\"great\\". American actress Michelle Pfeiffer provided the voice of Mindy Simmons in the episode. All the writers showed up at the recording studio in West Los Angeles to see her record her lines. When Pfeiffer entered the room with her daughter, Pfeiffer was \\"mobbed\\" by the energy of the writers and directors, who were excited to see her. Mirkin, who directed Pfeiffer in the studio, was nervous because he thought she was a beautiful woman who was on a \\"completely different level\\" than the other actors and actresses he had directed on the show. Pfeiffer was also nervous because she had never voiced an animated character. Mirkin told her: \\"You're gonna love this more than anything you have ever done because it's calm and pleasant, and we have so much time to play and experiment.\\" This helped her calm down and by the end of the session, she was \\"really relaxed\\" and they had a \\"fantastic\\" time. Silverman told Pfeiffer to not sound too flirty, and that she should just act herself. In one scene in the episode, Mindy drools as she eats doughnuts, much like Homer does. To get the right drool sound, Pfeiffer put broccoli and water in her mouth. Mirkin said he did not have to give much direction during the recording of Homer and Mindy's final scene together, in which Mindy tells Homer how she feels about him. Pfeiffer \\"hit it really well\\" and they did it several times to get it \\"more and more real\\". Mirkin also thought that Pfeiffer completely understood the part and played it perfectly. He described her as \\"one of those actresses that you don't even have to see to know they're great, instead you can hear from her voice what a brilliant actress she is.\\" Dan Castellaneta was also praised by Mirkin for his performance as Homer. Castellaneta struggled to be \\"sweet\\" and \\"moving\\" in his performance. When Homer calls a marriage counseling hotline in the episode, he accidentally knocks himself unconscious in the phone booth. In a dream, he is approached by his guardian angel. The angel initially takes the form of Isaac Newton, but since Homer has no idea who that is, instead takes the form of Colonel Klink, then shows Homer what his life would be like without Marge (in the style of It's A Wonderful Life). Colonel Klink is a character on the American television series Hogan's Heroes. Klink's actor in Hogan's Heroes, Werner Klemperer, provided the voice of Klink in this episode. Mirkin said Klemperer was a \\"fantastic sport\\" to do the character. Since Hogan's Heroes had gone off the air in 1971, he had forgotten how to play Klink. Mirkin therefore had to do an impression of Klink that Klemperer could imitate to get it right. Cultural references When Homer first meets Mindy, he imagines her as Venus in Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus. To deal with Homer and Mindy charging room service to the company, Mr. Burns unleashes flying monkeys in the manner of the Wicked Witch of the West, as seen in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. However, the attempt fails as the monkeys all fall to their deaths. The scene where Homer meets his guardian angel in the guise of Isaac Newton (who changes into Colonel Klink from Hogan's Heroes because Homer has no idea who Newton is), wondering what his life would have been like if he married Mindy and not Marge, draws from the films It's A Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol. When Homer meets Mindy in the elevator, he thinks \\"unsexy thoughts\\" to avoid being seduced by her. He imagines Barney in a bikini and humming the theme tune to the American sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. Homer attempts to read the notes for Mindy that he wrote on his hand, but they have smeared out because of sweat. In his attempt, Homer unknowingly babbles the Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, a Japanese Buddhist chant in Nichiren Buddhism and Soka Gakkai. This is a reference to an Akbar and Jeff cartoon, written by Matt Groening, in which the same mantra is used. When Homer notices the sweat, he says he is \\"sweating like [film critic] Roger Ebert\\". In the bathroom, Homer sings a rough version of the song \\"Mandy\\" by Barry Manilow, replacing \\"Mandy\\" with \\"Mindy\\". Homer refers to comic strip Ziggy when he wonders if Mindy agrees the title character has become \\"too preachy\\". Barry White's song \\"Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe\\" is played in the episode's final scene where Homer and Marge make out at the hotel room. Reception alt=A man in glasses and a plaid shirt sits in front of a microphone. In its original American broadcast, \\"The Last Temptation of Homer\\" finished 24th (tied with The Fresh Prince of Bel Air) in the ratings for the week of December 6‚Äì12, 1993. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.7. Retrieved on January 8, 2009. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. In 2003, it was placed tenth on Entertainment Weekly's top 25 The Simpsons episode list, and The Daily Telegraph characterized the episode as one of \\"The 10 Best Simpsons Television Episodes\\". Nancy Basile of About.com named it one of her top twenty favorite episodes of the show, and said Michelle Pfeiffer \\"is so elegant and beautiful, that the irony of her playing a burping love interest for Homer Simpson is funny enough.\\" She added \\"the thorny issue of adultery is tackled in a way only The Simpsons could,\\" and \\"though Homer is contemplating cheating, he's a sympathetic and almost innocent character.\\" Robert Canning of IGN called the episode \\"smart, touching and funny\\", and said \\"it did a great job showing Homer's struggle to deal with the flirtations of a co-worker.\\" The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it a \\"wonderfully scripted episode\\". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said, \\"Given Homer‚Äôs utter devotion to Marge, it may seem off- character for him to fall for Mindy, but the show makes it fit, as his obsession doesn‚Äôt come across as inconsistent.\\" He added the plot with Bart becoming a nerd is the \\"funnier one\\" of the two. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk called it a \\"jest fest loaded with insight into the human heart and hilarious over-the-top goofiness.\\" TV DVD Reviews's Kay Daly called it the season's finest episode with the \\"greatest foray into emotional resonance\\". Matt Groening thought it was an amazing episode with \\"a lot of fun\\" in it. David Mirkin said Frank Mula's script was great. In a 2008 article, Entertainment Weekly named Pfeiffer's role as Mindy one of the 16 best guest appearances on The Simpsons. She also appeared on AOL's list of their top favorite guest stars on the show. Brett Buckalew of Metromix Indianapolis wrote that Pfeiffer \\"gives arguably the best celebrity guest-vocal performance in series history.\\" Total Film's Nathan Ditum ranked her performance as the 15th best guest appearance in the show's history. When the inspectors visit the plant, they mention finding an entire Brazilian soccer team working there, and Burns says that they have to because their plane crashed on his property. This scene was mentioned by various media outlets after the 2016 disaster that killed most players on the Brazilian team Chapecoense.

According to the text, she was the daughter of Jaichand, the King of Kannauj, and one of three wives of Prithviraj Chauhan. Prithviraj Chauhan is a popular figure of romance and chivalry from the folklore of medieval India. The love between Prithviraj and Samyukta is one of India's most popular medieval romances, immortalized in Chand Bardai's epic Prithviraj Raso (or, Chand Raisa), but the historicity of the Samyukta episode remains a matter of debate. Legend Abduction of Samyukta At the peak of his reign, Prithviraj had annexed vast regions of India to his kingdom, and his fame had spread all across the subcontinent and to Afghanistan. Many lesser kings were envious and wary of his power, including Raja Jaichand of Kannauj. Jaichand's daughter, Samyukta, was a headstrong girl who was known for her bewitching beauty. She is said to have fallen in love with Prithviraj- like the two other princesses, Shashivrata and Padmavati, before her‚Äîas his reputation dazzled her. She desired nobody but him. For his part, Prithviraj had heard of Samyukta's loveliness and fell in love with her as well. However, Jaichand and Prithviraj were rivals. On finding out about the affair, Raja Jaichand was outraged that a romance had been budding behind his back. Jaichand decided to insult Prithviraj and arranged a swayamvara for his daughter in 1185 CE. He invited royalty from far and wide to the ceremony, every eligible prince and king- except Prithviraj. He then commissioned a clay statue of Prithviraj, which served as a dvarpala(or, a figurative \\"doorman\\") to Jaichand's court. Prithviraj Chauhan, on hearing about the impending swayamvara, devised a plan to elope with the bride to be. On the day of the ceremony, Samyukta walked through the court holding the ceremonial garland, ignoring the gazes of her ardent suitors. She passed through the door and put the garland around the neck of Prithviraj's statue, declaring him her husband. Prithiviraj, who meanwhile was hiding behind the statue, caught Samyukta up in his arms, set her on his horse, and whisked her away to Delhi. Raja Jaichand was enraged. This led to a rift between Delhi and Kannauj, which was later taken advantage of by Mohammad Ghori of Afghanistan.  Historicity  The historicity of Samyukta is a matter of debate. Prithviraj Raso is a historically unreliable text, having been embellished under the patronage of the Rajput rulers since the 16th century. However, some scholars such as Dasharatha Sharma believe that the more reliable Prithviraja Vijaya, which was composed during the reign of Prithviraj Chauhan, also contains a reference to Samyukta. An unfinished theme in the 11th chapter of Prithviraja Vijaya refers to Prithviraj's love for an unnamed woman who lived on the banks of the Ganges river (just like Samyukta). This woman is mentioned as an incarnation of Tilottama, a legendary apsara (celestial nymph). However, even if this woman is same as Samyukta, there is no concrete evidence to support the Prithviraj Raso narrative of Samyuka's abduction and marriage to Prithviraj Chauhan. Modern Indian culture \\"Samyukta\\", which means \\"united\\" in Sanskrit, is a popular girl's name in modern India. The life of Prithviraj Chauhan has also been the subject of a television show aired on Star Plus, and a historical film titled Raani Samyuktha was made in 1962 with Padmini and M. G. Ramachandran in the lead roles. In the film Prithviraj by Chandraprakash Dwivedi, the character of Samyukta is portrayed by Manushi Chhillar.

Thomas Thurlow (1813 ‚Äì 1899) was a renowned English sculptor who created memorials in churches in the Saxmundham, Suffolk area, including a bust of the poet George Crabbe in St Peter and St Paul's Church, Aldeburgh. His father, John Thurlow (b. c1784), was a builder and stonemason who built 'The White House' (now Holly Lodge) in the High Street. Both are buried along with other members of the Thurlow family in the churchyard of the parish church. Life Thomas Thurlow was born in North Entrance in Saxmundham and went to a school in Brook Cottage; Henry Bright (painter) went to the same school, and in Thurlow's memoirs he also claims Newson Garrett (who later built Snape Maltings) as a school friend. As a teenager he would turn his hand to anything such as wood and plaster carving, polishing stones, and he even made a violin, succeeding at the second attempt. At the age of 23 he left home for London where he was engaged by a monument manufacturer in Regent Street. During his spare time he took lessons in oil painting, something he pursued throughout his life (some of his paintings are in the Moot Hall in Aldeburgh). After a time employed with the London Marble Works, where he gained experience of stone carving, Thurlow returned to Suffolk first opening a business in Halesworth and then settling back in Saxmundham in 1839. During his life, Thurlow completed many works for local people and various churches, including a memorial to Sir C. Blois from Cockfield Hall in Yoxford Church, a life-size statue of Samuel Clouting in Kelsale Church, a marble bust of Richard Garrett III in Leiston Church, and a commission from William Long of Hurts Hall to carve a rose and spray for the entrance to his mansion. As well as paid works, he exhibited widely including at the Royal Academy and the Ipswich Fine Art Club. He was active in the town being appointed the Secretary and manager of the Saxmundham Gas Works (which was in Gas Hill now New Cut), he was an Overseer for the Parish making and collecting the Rates, he was the town Surveyor supervising the building of Gurneys bank in Market Place amongst others, and in 1847 he acquired the Licence for Photography for the County of Suffolk which he practised for a time. He is reported to have given penny readings in the Market Hall, reciting from Dickens to packed audiences.

Publication history Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the Wrecker made his first appearance in Thor #148 (January 1968). Fictional character biography Dirk Garthwaite, a.k.a. the Wrecker, first appeared in Thor, and is depicted as a former manual laborer for a demolitions crew who is fired for his violent and anti-social tendencies. Garthwaite created a costume for himself and called himself the Wrecker, committing a series of robberies, demolishing looted locations and leaving a crowbar at the scene of the crime. The Wrecker entered a hotel room occupied by Asgardian god Loki, the adopted brother and archenemy of the Thunder God Thor. Upon knocking out the de-powered Loki, the Wrecker put on his helmet and received an enchantment from Loki's ally, Karnilla the Norn Queen, who assumed he was Loki because the Wrecker was wearing his helmet and she only saw him from the back. Therefore, Karniila was the source of his newfound enchanted powers. Reveling in his power, the Wrecker embarked on a crime spree and defeated Thor who, at the time, had had his power severely reduced by his father Odin (ruler of the Norse gods) as punishment for choosing to remain on Earth. A building collapsed onto the Thunder God, nearly killing him. The Wrecker was defeated by the Asgardian goddess Sif, who animated the armor of the Asgardian Destroyer to save Thor. The Wrecker's crowbar was shattered.Thor #148 - 150 (Jan. - March 1968) The Wrecker returned and battled Thor again, although a fully restored Thor easily defeated him.Thor #171 (Dec. 1969) The Wrecker returned in The Defenders, and this time appeared with three superpowered partners in crime: Bulldozer, Piledriver and Thunderball. Empowered when holding the crowbar as it is struck by lightning, the villains joined the Wrecker to become the Wrecking Crew. While searching for a gamma bomb built by Thunderball with which they hope to extort New York City, the Wrecking Crew battled several members of the Defenders: Doctor Strange; Nighthawk and the Hulk.

The Wrecker is later seen in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, where he is interrogated by the Thing.Infamous Iron Man #7 The Wrecker and the rest of the Wrecking Crew were seen as members of the Hood's gang as the Wrecking Crew led the attack on Castle Doom. The Wrecker and Thunderball were taken down by Doctor Doom in his Iron Man armor until the Hood showed up with the rest of his gang and shot him with one of his enchanted bullets. As Rampage and Shockwave held him down, the Wrecker was ordered to rip open Doctor Doom's Iron Man armor. As the Wrecker prepared to do the final opening move, Victor von Doom disappeared in a bright light, leaving the armor behind.Invincible Iron Man #597-598 Powers and abilities Courtesy of an Asgardian enchantment placed on him by mistake by Karnilla the Norn Queen, the Wrecker possesses superhuman strength, stamina and durability (bulletproof). When he initially shares the Norn power with the rest of the Wrecking Crew, the Wrecker's abilities were reduced by one-fourth. After receiving training from Ulik the Rock Troll, the Wrecker no longer suffers from this handicap and is now capable of using his powers to their full potential and use the crowbar in the same fashion that Thor can utilize his mystic hammer Mjolnir. He has used the crowbar to demolish entire buildings in minutes and to hold off the Thunder God Thor in battle. The Wrecker primarily uses the crowbar offensively as both a throwing and blunt weapon. While the Wrecker is the true source of the power, at times the power can be transferred into the crowbar. The crowbar's secondary abilities include absorbing and projecting energy, creating illusions, generating a force field, creating minor earthquakes, teleportation and returning to the Wrecker when thrown. The Wrecker also shares a mental link with the crowbar and can mentally control any weak-minded individual who touches it. The Wrecker was also able to temporarily mystically impart superhuman strength to the individual and surround him/her in an impenetrable force field around that person that would protect that person until the individual reached the Wrecker. The individual would be in a trance-like state while they were holding the crowbar and under the Wrecker's control. The trance would be broken once the crowbar was in the Wrecker's possession and the person would have no memory of their experience with the crowbar. The Wrecker is the most powerful member of the Wrecking Crew and while many believe his crowbar is the source of their powers (Thunderball thought that when he attempted to steal the crowbar, until his hand was crushed by the Wrecker in a \\"friendly\\" hand- shake while the crowbar was in Thunderball's possession), it is the Wrecker himself that is the source of the Wrecking Crew's powers, especially after Ulik's training.Thor #418 Other characters named the Wrecker * The first Marvel supervillain known as the Wrecker fought Giant-Man and the Wasp in Tales to Astonish #63. He was a two-bit shake-down artist who wore a hood and used DDT and bear traps for weapons. Even at the time, Stan Lee knew this villain was not up to par: \\"Can we confess something to you? We feel 'The Wrecker' was kind of a weak Giant-Man tale!\\"Tales to Astonish #63 * There was also a man named Karl Kort who went by the name the Wrecker in The Fantastic Four #12. This issue is also famous for depicting the first meeting between the Fantastic Four and the Hulk.The Fantastic Four #12 Other versions =Marvel Apes= The simian version of the Wrecker and his mystical monkey- wrench were vital to the defense of his home dimension from flesh-hungry zombies. While the Wrecker himself fell to the zombies early on, his weapon was used by trans-dimensional travelers interested in saving innocent lives.Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution #1 =House of M: Masters of Evil= The Wrecker (along with the rest of the Wrecking Crew) appears as a member of the Hood's Masters of Evil.House of M: Masters of Evil #1 =Ultimate Marvel= This version of the Wrecker first appeared in the Ultimate Marvel imprint title Ultimate Spider-Man as a member of Damage Control,Ultimate Spider-Man #86 (Jan. 2006) before he became villainous.Ultimate Hulk Annual #1 In other media =Television= * The Wrecker appears in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"To Err is Superhuman\\", voiced by Charlie Adler. * The Wrecker appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \\"Thor the Mighty\\", voiced by JB Blanc. * The Wrecker appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"Damage\\", voiced by John DiMaggio. * The Wrecker appears in Avengers Assemble, voiced again by John DiMaggio.

The term has also been used to refer to areas: * Undergoing insurgency where the ruling authorities have lost control and are unable to enforce their sovereignty; * That are inhabited by a parallel society which has its own laws and is controlled by violent non-state actors.Chaudhry, Rajeev. Violent Non- State Actors: Contours, Challenges and Consequences. CLAWS Journal - Winter 2013. . Quote: Although the patterns of causation are not always clear, there is a correlation between a state's weakness and the emergence of one or another kind of VNSAs. States with low levels of legitimacy, for example, are unable to create or maintain the loyalty and allegiance of their populations. In these circumstances, individuals and groups typically revert to, or develop, alternative patterns of affiliation. The result is often the creation of \\"no-go\\" zones or spaces in which VNSAs emerge as a form of alternative governance. Some types of no-go zones, such as military exclusion zones, border zones, or other declared exclusion zones, may have a legal basis. De facto no-go zones may arise in conjunction with inadequate local governance or tactical advantage. The boundaries of de facto no-go zones are volatile and responsive to changes in security and tactical advantage. No-go zone boundaries can be negotiated between hostile parties or declared unilaterally by one side of a conflict. Other no-go zones are undeclared or unofficial, making accurate boundary identification difficult. No-go zones in which rescue or security services are unavailable enable unrestricted lethal violence. There has been controversy about the existence of no-go zones in various European countries, such as France and Sweden, as well as the United States. Some politicians and commentators have falsely claimed the existence of no-go zones in areas with large populations of Muslims and immigrants, where, they claim, national law has been displaced by sharia law or where there is lawlessness. Some have later recanted these statements, while others have faced press scrutiny for their allegations. Historical no-go areas =Hong Kong= With no government enforcement from the British colonial government aside from a few raids by the Hong Kong Police, the Kowloon Walled City became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the Walled City that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By this time, however, the Walled City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as Triads. Beginning in the 1950s, Triad groups such as the 14K and Sun Yee On gained a stranglehold on the Walled City's countless brothels, gambling parlors, and opium dens. The Walled City had become such a haven for criminals that police would venture into it only in large groups. =Mexico= =Mozambique= During the Mozambican War of Independence, the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) set up and defended no-go \\"liberated zones\\" in the north of the country. =Northern Ireland= Free Derry Corner, the gable wall which once marked the entrance to Free Derry During the Troubles, the term was applied to urban areas in Northern Ireland where the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army could not operate openly.Gillespie, Gordon. (2009) The A to Z of the Northern Ireland Conflict. Scarecrow Press pp.177-178 Between 1969 and 1972, Irish nationalist/republican neighborhoods in Belfast and Derry were sealed off with barricades by residents. The areas were policed by vigilantes and both Official and Provisional factions of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) operated openly.David McKittrick et al, Lost Lives (Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing, 2008) p. 176 The most notable no-go area was called Free Derry. The areas' existence was a challenge to the authority of the British government. On 31 July 1972, the British Army demolished the barricades and re-established control in Operation Motorman. It was the biggest British military operation since the Suez Crisis.Chronology of the Conflict: 1972. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). Although the areas were no longer barricaded, they remained areas where the British security forces found it difficult to operate and were regularly attacked. As a result, they entered only in armored convoys and in certain circumstances, such as to launch house raids. Police presence in these areas remained contentious into the 2000s and the main republican political party, Sinn F√©in, refused to support the police. In 2007, however, the party voted to support the new Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). =Pakistan= The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) were in actuality no-go areas for the Pakistani authorities, where the Pakistani police could not enter. The situation was changed temporarily with the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, when the Pakistani government was supported by U.S. military forces. Currently FATA is no more a \\"no-go area\\" as it has been merged with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. =Rhodesia= The term \\"no-go area\\" has a military origin and was first used in the context of the Bush War in Rhodesia. The war was fought in the 1960s and 1970s between the army of the predominantly white minority Rhodesian government and black nationalist groups. The initial military strategy of the government was to seal the borders to prevent assistance to the guerrillas from other countries. However, with the end of Portuguese colonial rule in Angola and Mozambique, and especially the arrival of some 500,000 Cuban armed forces and tens of thousands of Soviet troops, this became untenable and the white minority government adopted an alternative strategy (\\"mobile counter offensive\\"). This involved defending only key economic areas, transport links (\\"vital asset ground\\"), and the white civilian population. The government lost control of the rest of the country to the guerilla forces, but carried out counter-guerilla operations including \\"free-fire attacks\\" in the so-called \\"no-go areas,\\" note - first printed in South Africa in 1982 by Sygma Books and Collins Vaal where white civilians were advised not to go. =Venezuela= \\"Peace zones\\", seen in red, which were planned to receive economic benefits to be given to former gang members who agreed to surrender their weapons to the government and cease their criminal activity. In 2013, the Venezuelan government negotiated with large criminal gangs on how to prevent violence and agreed to set up demilitarized areas as \\"peace zones\\". The concept behind the zones was to provide gang members with economic resources and construction materials in exchange for the surrender of the gang's weapons, with the understanding that the resources would be used to repair local infrastructure. The Venezuelan government hoped that through this process, gang members would disarm and become law-abiding and productive members of society. In addition, the then-deputy Minister of the Interior reportedly agreed verbally to avoid police patrols within the zones, should the gangs agree to disarm. The plan backfired as the gang members used the money and resources given to them by the government in exchange for their weapons to acquire more powerful weapons and began committing yet more crimes and violence within the zones. According to InSight Crime, there are over a dozen mega-gangs in Venezuela, with some having up to 300 members. Alleged contemporary no-go areas =Belgium= In the wake of the 2015 Paris attacks, the Molenbeek municipality in Brussels was described in many media reports as a \\"no-go area\\", where gang violence and Islamic fundamentalism had fed on Molenbeek's marginalisation, despair and resentment of authority. In 2015 Belgium's home affairs minister said that the government did not \\"have control of the situation in Molenbeek\\" and that terrorists' links to this district were a \\"gigantic problem\\". Other academics, commentators, journalists and residents have contested the description of Molenbeek as a no-go zone.Robert Chalmers Is Molenbeek really a no-go zone?, GQ Magazine 21 June 2017Hans Vandecandelaere Old Molenbeek: A No-Go Zone? Goethe-Institut Br√ºssel, September 2016 \\"Hans Vandecandelaere is a writer and historian. For one of his books, \\"In Molenbeek\\" (Epo, 2015), he spent three years interviewing experts along with 200 of Old Molenbeek's residents to present a kaleidoscopic view of this stigmatised suburb.\\"Residents of Europe's 'No-Go Areas' Talk About Life in the Danger Zone, Vice, May 22, 2017 =Brazil= Some slum areas (known as favelas) in Brazil, most notably in Rio de Janeiro State, are controlled by gangs with automatic weapons. Police and investigative reporters have been tortured and killed there, such as Tim Lopes in 2002. Attempts at clearing up such areas have led to security crises in Rio as well as in the State of S√£o Paulo. These organized crime organizations are known in Brazil as \\"Factions\\" (Fac√ß√µes in Portuguese), the two largest are the PCC (Primeiro Comando da Capital) or \\"First Command of the Capital\\" in English from S√£o Paulo, and the Comando Vermelho (CV), \\"Red Command\\" in English, a faction from the Rio de Janeiro. =France= It has been falsely claimed that France has Muslim-only no-go zones that are under sharia law. An early usage of the term regarding Europe was in a 2002 opinion piece by David Ignatius in The New York Times, where he wrote about France, \\"Arab gangs regularly vandalize synagogues here, the North African suburbs have become no-go zones at night, and the French continue to shrug their shoulders.\\" Ignatius said the violence resulting in the no-go zone had come about due to inequality and racism directed towards French people of colour. La Courneuve, a poverty-stricken municipality (commune) in the Paris region whose residents felt the authorities had neglected them due to racism - was described by police as a no-go zone for officers without reinforcements. In 2010, Rapha√´l Stainville of French newspaper Le Figaro called certain neighborhoods of the southern city Perpignan \\"veritable lawless zones\\", saying they had become too dangerous to travel in at night. He added that the same was true in parts of B√©ziers and N√Æmes. In 2012, , the mayor of the French city Amiens, in the wake of several riots, called the northern part of his city a lawless zone, where one could no longer order a pizza or call for a doctor. The head of a local association said institutional violence had contributed to the tensions resulting in the no-go zone. In 2014, Fabrice Balanche, a scholar of the Middle East, labelled the northern city of Roubaix, as well as parts of Marseille, \\"mini-Islamic states\\", saying that the authority of the state is completely absent there. In 2005 France's domestic intelligence network, the Renseignements Generaux, identified 150 \\"no-go zones\\" around the country where police would not enter without reinforcements. Christopher Dickey, writing in Newsweek, said the situation had arisen due to racism towards immigrants.Christopher Dickey, Europe's Time Bomb, Newsweek, 2005-11-20 The New Republic said no-go zones had developed in France due to a failure to integrate immigrants from France's former colonies, claiming the country had not allowed people of colour to share in the 'blessings of liberty, equality and fraternity'.Donald Morrison, What Does It Mean to Be French? The 'Charlie Hebdo' Massacre Complicates the Answer, The New Republic, 2015-01-08 In January 2015, after the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris, various American media, including the news cable channels Fox News and CNN, described the existence of no-go zones across Europe and in France in particular. Both networks were criticized for these statements, and anchors on both networks later apologized for the mistaken characterizations. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said that she intended to sue Fox News for its statements. In 2016 Sevran, a Paris commune near Charles de Gaulle airport, in which the origins of the majority of the residents are from outside France and claimed by journalist David Chazan to be a predominantly Muslim area, was alleged by women's rights campaigners to be a no-go zone for women, where women are unofficially banned from public spaces by men. Others, including other women's rights campaigners, disputed this. =Germany= A sociology paper published in 2009 said that right-wing extremists had been discussing the creation of no-go areas in Western Europe since the 1980s. It described attempts to create \\"national liberated zones\\" (national befreite Zonen) in Germany: \\"'no-go-areas', which are areas dominated by neo- Nazis,\\"Novotny p. 591 attributing their appeal in the former DDR to \\"the unmet promises of modernisation and the poor socio-cultural conditions that offer no perspectives to young people\\".Novotny p.596 Whether or not Germany actually had no-go zones was disputed: the paper concluded \\"according to ... state officials, the police and other relevant institutions, [the phenomenon of no- go zones] does not actually exist ... by contrast, the national press in Germany, various civic associations, and also experts acknowledge and give examples of the existence of no-go areas.\\"Novotny p.605 In a February 2018 interview, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that there are no-go areas in Germany, saying, \\"There are such areas and one has to call them by their name and do something about them.\\" This came in the context of arguing for a zero-tolerance policy in German policing. = Kenya = In Kenya, the ongoing conflict in Somalia, where the terrorist organization al-Shabaab controls territory, has severely affected the security situation even on the Kenyan side of the border. There have been terrorist attacks and kidnappings in Kenya followed by a Kenyan intervention, Operation Linda Nchi, and police crackdowns. These have affected counties bordering Somalia and in Nairobi, the suburb of Eastleigh, which is inhabited mostly by Somalis. Already in 2004, Eastleigh was described as a no-go zone for Kenyan authorities after dark.Menkhaus, Ken. Somalia: State Collapse and the Threat of Terrorism. The Adelphi Papers, Volume 44, 2004. https://doi.org/10.1080/714027945 = Israel and Palestine = The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) maintains a border zone on the Gaza strip and declares \\"no-go zones\\", where they may use lethal force to enforce the security exclusion zone. An IDF spokesman said that \\"residents of the Gaza Strip are required not to come any closer than 300 meters from the security fence\\", although there is some allowance for farmers to approach up to 100 meters if they do so on foot only. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that the no-go zones include about 30% of the arable land in the Gaza strip, and a small number of residents farm in the exclusion zones despite the risk of military action. (subscription required for access to full article) Unlike a legal border zone, the no-go zone is declared unilaterally in occupied territory, without acknowledgement or cooperation of Palestinian authorities, and as such can be considered a disputed no-go zone. It is considered unlawful by the Swedish organization Diakonia. = South Africa = The term \\"no-go zone\\" has been informally applied to high-crime neighborhoods in South African cities. In South Africa, the apartheid policy created segregated neighborhoods where whites risked being removed or victimized in black-only neighborhoods and vice versa. Because of the bantustan system, many urban inhabitants lived in the city illegally per apartheid laws. For example, in Cape Town, Cape Flats was a neighborhood where many of those evicted were relocated. It became a \\"no-go area\\" as it was controlled by criminal gangs. However, many of these areas have experienced significant gentrification; for example, Woodstock in Cape Town has experience significant urban renewal and cannot be described as a no- go zone anymore. In 2010, a housing complex comprising a number of city blocks in Atlantis, Western Cape were described as a \\"no-go zone for police conducting raids\\",Buthelezi, M.W. Gang violence in the Western Cape. Research Unit, Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, 08 August 2012. http://pmg- assets.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docs/120821%20gang_0.pdf and ambulances could not enter without police escort. In 2014, the situation had improved, and after convictions of several gang members, a police official said that \\"legislation concerning organised crime was beginning to work\\". In 2018, a gang war in Parkwood, Cape Town was reported to turn the area into a \\"no-go zone\\", although a minister visited the area to ensure policing continues. = United States = Some conservative American political figures, including Tony Perkins and Jim Newberger, have falsely claimed that some communities within the United States are either governed by Sharia law or are Muslim-controlled no-go zones. In June 2020, the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone was established as a \\"No Cop Co-op.\\"Free Food, Free Speech and Free of Police: Inside Seattle‚Äôs ‚ÄòAutonomous Zone‚Äô, The New York Times See also *Bantustan *No man's land *Closed city *Demilitarized zone *Exclusionary zoning *Fukushima exclusion zone *Geographical segregation *Hot zone (environment) *LGBT-free zone *Lazaretto (Lazarat) *Sundown town *Vulnerable area (Sweden) () *Zone interdite, two distinct territories established in German-occupied France during World War II References Category:Metaphors referring to places Category:English phrases Category:Military of Rhodesia Category:Security Category:Crime Category:Crime prevention Category:English words ","title":"No-go area"},{"id":"3605318","text":"The following lists events hat happened during 2006 in Denmark.

The construction is based on the EU07 locomotive. History In the 1970s PKP intended to increase speed of Polish passenger trains, which resulted mainly in building CMK line (Trunk Line) and the modernisation of EU05 locomotives into EP05 series. Meanwhile a project was opened to introduce new electric locomotives able to pull trains with speed exceeding , based on British EU06 and local EU07 machines. In 1972 the first prototype left Pafawag works and until 1976 a total number of 15 units had been produced. Further production was ceased due to huge orders of freight locomotives and insufficient funds for importing foreign parts for the machine. EP08 were the first locomotives in Poland to exceed the top speed limit of and contributed (alongside the EP05 class) into fast development of high speed passenger connections. All machines of this class station in Warsaw but as top speed on Warsaw-Pozna≈Ñ line had been increased to they are no longer used on regular basis and serve as auxiliary machines, mostly pulling trains from Warsaw to Zakopane. Since 2015, EP08 began receiving major repair and modernizations in ZNTK Ole≈õnica, later Olkol Ole≈õnica. Halogen headlights were installed, air conditioning added, modern radiotelephones added (except 001), multiple steering parts removed (again except 001) Technical data As the EP08 is tightly based on EU06 and EU07 locomotives it is important to compare those series while writing about technical features. EP08 is a Bo‚Ä≤Bo‚Ä≤ locomotive with four axles mounted on two bogies. Each axle is propelled separately by an EE541a traction motor. The cab has two identical crew compartments on both ends. The main differences between EP08 and previous EU07 locomotives are as follows. Transmission was changed from 79:18 into 77:24 what resulted in possible top speed of . However, the machined performed poorely driving with such speed, so the top speed was set to . First five units were equipped with plain bearings what proved insufficient for higher speeds and as a result all these locomotives were rebuilt as EU07 series (numbers 241 to 244). In later units roller bearing's were used. Another significant change comparing to EU07 series was exchange of traction motors to newer EE541g type with higher isolation class. Windscreens were changed to thick ones with heating layer and pneumatic wipers. However, some solutions from EU07 locomotives which were rather faulty, were copied into this machines, like poor access to internal devices. EU08 is suited for multiple steering work. Locomotive's cab resembles those of EU06 and EU07, but have different, orange and brown painting. Since June 2007 PKP Intercity has started repainting those machines into new, blue and white colours.

A supplicatio can also be a thanksgiving after the receipt of aid.Frances Hickson Hahn, \\"Performing the Sacred: Prayers and Hymns,\\" pp. 238, 247, and John Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors,\\" p. 270, both in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007). Supplications might also be ordered in response to prodigies (prodigia); again, the population as a whole wore wreaths, carried laurel twigs, and attended sacrifices at temple precincts throughout the city.Veit Rosenberger, in \\"Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Related Beliefs,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 296.  Usage  A supplicatio was decreed for two different reasons: As a thanksgiving, when a great victory had been gained. It was usually decreed as soon as official intelligence of the victory had been received by a letter from the general in command. The number of days during which it was to last was proportioned to the importance of the victory. Sometimes it was decreed for only one day but more commonly for three or five days. A supplication of ten days was first decreed in honour of Pompey at the conclusion of the war with Mithridates and one of fifteen days after the victory over the Belgae by Caesar, an honour which Caesar himself says had never been granted to any one before. Subsequently a supplicatio of twenty days was decreed after his conquest of Vercingetorix. From this time the senate seems to have frequently increased the number of days out of mere compliment to the general. We thus find mention of thanksgivings for forty days, fifty days and even sixty. A supplicatio was usually regarded as a prelude to a triumph but it was not always followed by one, as Cato reminds Cicero, to whose honour a supplicatio had been decreed. This honour was conferred upon Cicero on account of his suppression of the conspiracy of Catiline, which had never been decreed to any one before in a civil capacity (togatus) as he frequently takes occasion to mention. A Supplicatio, a solemn supplication and humiliation, was also decreed in times of public danger and distress and on account of prodigies to avert the anger of the gods.

It is a satire of Lord Bolingbroke's deism. Burke confronted Bolingbroke not in the sphere of religion but civil society and government, arguing that his arguments against revealed religion could apply to all institutions. So close to Bolingbroke's style was the work, that Burke's ironic intention was missed by some readers, leading Burke in his preface to the second edition (1757) to make plain that it was a satire. Nonetheless, this work was considered by William Godwin to be the first literary expression of philosophical anarchism.Godwin attributed the first anarchist writing to Edmund Burke's A Vindication of Natural Society. \\"Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's Vindication of Natural Society; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence‚Ä¶\\" ‚Äì footnote, Ch. 2 Political Justice by William Godwin. Satire Most historians believe Vindication was intended as satire, but some others disagree. For example, Murray Rothbard argues that Burke wrote the Vindication in earnest but later wished to disavow it for political reasons.Sobran, Joseph, Anarchism, Reason, and History: \\"Oddly enough, the great conservative Edmund Burke began his career with an anarchist tract, arguing that the state was naturally and historically destructive of human society, life, and liberty. Later he explained that he‚Äôd intended his argument ironically, but many have doubted this. His argument for anarchy was too powerful, passionate, and cogent to be a joke. Later, as a professional politician, Burke seems to have come to terms with the state, believing that no matter how bloody its origins, it could be tamed and civilized, as in Europe, by ‚Äúthe spirit of a gentleman, and the spirit of religion.‚Äù But even as he wrote, the old order he loved was already breaking down. \\" Rothbard's argument is based on a misunderstanding. He believes it took nine years (until 1765) for Edmund Burke to divulge that he was the author of the work, and only claimed it to be a satire to save his then spawning political career. In reality Edmund Burke reveals both his authorship and claims the book as a satire in the preface to its second edition published in 1757, long before he would embark upon a political career. Among passages that have been taken both as Swiftian irony and as a theoretical realization of the danger such controversial opinions may have upon a career is: :\\"Far am I from proposing in the least to reflect on our most wise Form of Government; no more than I would in the freer Parts of my philosophical Writings, mean to object to the Piety, Truth, and Perfection of our most excellent Church.\\" :\\"A Man is allowed sufficient Freedom of Thought, provided he knows how to chuse his Subject properly. You may criticise freely upon the Chinese Constitution, and observe with as much Severity as you please upon the Absurd Tricks, or destructive Bigotry of the Bonzees. But the Scene is changed as you come homeward, and Atheism or Treason may be the Names given in Britain, to what would be Reason and Truth if asserted of China.\\" Content The preface presents the occasion of the essay as a riposte to the philosophy of Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke (died 1751), whose Collected Works and Letters had been published by David Mallet in 5 volumes in 1754. A new preface was written by Burke after his authorship was discovered. In this apologetic preface, he wrote that Vindication was inspired by \\"seeing every Mode of Religion attacked in a lively Manner, and the Foundation of every Virtue, and of all Government, sapped with great Art and much Ingenuity\\" in Lord Bolingbroke's collected Works. This author's design has been to show :\\"without the Exertion of any considerable Forces, the same Engines which were employed for the Destruction of Religion, might be employed with equal Success for the Subversion of Government; and that specious Arguments might be used against those Things which they, who doubt of every thing else, will never permit to be questioned.\\" The author contrasts Natural Society with Political Society beginning with a distrust of the Mind, which \\"every Day invents some new artificial Rule to guide that Nature which if left to itself were the best and surest Guide.\\" He proposes to set out to identify those \\"unalterable Relations which Providence has ordained that every thing should bear to every other. These Relations, which are Truth itself, the Foundation of Virtue, and consequently, the only Measures of Happiness.\\" In the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment, the author expresses every confidence in the cumulative Progress of the human condition: :\\"The Fabrick of Superstition has in this our Age and Nation received much ruder Shocks than it had ever felt before; and through the Chinks and Breaches of our Prison, we see such Glimmerings of Light, and feel such refreshing Airs of Liberty, as daily raise our Ardor for more. The Miseries derived to Mankind from Superstition, under the Name of Religion, and of ecclesiastical Tyranny under the Name of Church Government, have been clearly and usefully exposed.\\" In a swift survey of history, he finds nothing but \\"Tumults, Rebellions, Massacres, Assassinations, Proscriptions, and a Series of Horror\\" and remarks that \\"All Empires have been cemented in Blood\\" as the casualties mount in the millions, with cruelties perfected by technology. Contrasted with natural Liberty and natural Religion, the author sets three general forms of government, which he describes with the same emphatic detail as used in the Satires of Juvenal: Despotism, the simplest and most universal, where \\"unbounded Power proceeds Step by Step, until it has eradicated every laudable Principle\\"; Aristocracy, which is scarcely better, as \\"a Genoese, or a Venetian Republick, is a concealed Despotism\\"; and giddy Democracy, where the common people are \\"intoxicated with the Flatteries of their Orators\\": :\\"Republicks have many Things in the Spirit of absolute Monarchy, but none more than this; a shining Merit is ever hated or suspected in a popular Assembly, as well as in a Court.\\" Having employed fulminating rhetoric to dispense with the artificial Political Societies-- \\"after so fair an Examen, wherein nothing has been exaggerated; no Fact produced which cannot be proved\\"--the author, it might be expected, will turn to his idea of Natural Society for contrast. Instead, he turns his critical eye upon the Mixed government, which combines monarchy, aristocracy and a tempered democracy, the form of politics this essay's British readers would immediately identify as their own. His satirist's view takes it all in, painting once again in broad strokes the dilemmas of the law courts or the dissatisfactions of wealth, and closes-- without actually having vindicated natural society at all. Embedded in the whirl of extravagant invective, Burke is able, like all writers of Menippean satire, to express some subversive criticism: :\\"You may criticise freely upon the Chinese Constitution, and observe with as much Severity as you please upon the Absurd Tricks, or destructive Bigotry of the Bonzees. But the Scene is changed as you come homeward, and Atheism or Treason may be the Names given in Britain, to what would be Reason and Truth if asserted of China.\\" See also *Noble savage Notes References *On-line text *(Edmund Burke), A Vindication of Natural Society: A View of the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind (Liberty Fund, 1982) .

The species is endemic to Asia. Description R. subminiatus has a greenish hue with red and yellow regions near the head. It grows to in total length (including tail). Habitat and diet The red-necked keelback generally lives near ponds, where it consumes frogs and fish. Snakebite and venom R. subminiatus is a rear-fanged species and was previously thought to be harmless. However, following one fatal and several near-fatal envenomations, the toxicity of its venom was investigated. As a result, it has recently been reclassified as a dangerous species. Rear-fanged snakes need to bite and hold on, or repeatedly bite, to have any effect on humans. A chewing action facilitates envenomation, as the venom ducts open to fangs that are externally grooved (not hollow) and are posterior in the oral cavity. R. subminiatus has enlarged and ungrooved teeth. The species has two enlarged teeth in the back of the jaw. Located in the upper jaw is a gland known as Duvernoy's gland, which produces an extremely venomous secretion. Extraction of snake venom from the red-necked keelback snake =Symptoms caused by venom= When the snake bites, the salivary venom mixture is not injected, but it flows into the punctures produced by the upper jaw's rear teeth, which can penetrate the skin of humans. The venom from R. subminiatus has been responsible for internal hemorrhaging, including hemorrhaging of the brain, as well as nausea, coagulopathy, and even disseminated intravascular coagulation. Also, when the venom was tested on animals, kidney failure was reported. Caution should be taken when dealing with patients who have been bitten by the red-necked keelback snake. No further injury such as injections should be used because this may cause excessive bleeding in the bite victim. Although most bites of humans from R. subminiatus are involved with the front teeth and do not cause adverse effects, rare bites from the rear fangs can be lethal.

The species is endemic to South Asia. Etymology The specific name, leithii, is in honor of Andrew H. Leith, a physician with the Bombay Sanitary Commission.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Psammophis leithii, p. 155). Geographic range Psammophis leithii is found in Afghanistan, western India (Kachchh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra), and Pakistan. Description P. leithii has the rostral broader than deep, visible from above. The nostril is between two or three shields, the posterior nasal being frequently divided into two. The internasals are about half the length of the prefrontals. The frontal is very narrow, longer than its distance from the end of the snout, nearly as long as the parietals. The loreal is about twice as long as deep. There is a single preocular, in contact with the frontal; and two postoculars. The temporals are 1+2 or 2+2. There are 8 or 9 upper labials, the fourth and fifth (or fifth and sixth) entering the eye. There are 5 lower labials in contact with the anterior chin shields, which are a little shorter than the posterior chin shields. The dorsal scales are in 17 rows at midbody. The ventrals number 177-188. The anal is usually entire, and the subcaudals number 82-138. P. leithii is pale greyish or yellowish above, with black dots or four longitudinal brown bands which are usually edged with black, the outer passing through the eyes. The lower parts are white, uniform or spotted or marked with grey or olive in the middle, with or without a dark lateral line or series of dots. It may attain a total length of , which includes a tail long.Boulenger GA (1890). The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma. Reptilia and Batrachia. London: Secretary of State for India in Council. (Taylor and Francis, printers). xviii + 541 pp. (Psammophis leithii, pp. 365-366). Venom Like all species in the genus Psammophis, P. leithii possess a mild venom, which is delivered to prey by means of enlarged, grooved teeth at the rear of the snake's upper jaws. The venom is not usually harmful to humans.Branch, Bill (2004). Field Guide to Snakes and other Reptiles of Southern Africa. Third Revised edition, Second impression.

During the 1960s he was a national champion on numerous occasions but had mixed success at international level.Josef Odlo≈æil. Sports Reference. Retrieved on 1 February 2015. He won a silver medal in the 1500 metres at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Running career An avid runner since early age, Odlo≈æil began training with a coach at a military school in Bratislava. At his first major competition, the 1962 European Athletics Championships in Belgrade, Odlo≈æil was eliminated in the 800 metres semi- final. Two years later he ran 1500 metres at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Peter Snell easily won the final, but Odlo≈æil managed to get silver ahead of John Davies. In 1965 Odlo≈æil set a new world record on 2000 m (5:01,2). The 1966 European Athletics Championships were disastrous for Odlo≈æil as he was eliminated already in the heats. He did better at the 1967 European Athletics Indoor Championships in Prague, taking silver in the 1500 m, but at the 1968 Olympics finished only eighth in the 1500 m. Odlo≈æil retired in 1969. Retirement After retiring from competitions Odlo≈æil, a career military officer, was also forced to retire from the Czechoslovak Army, for political reasons. He turned into coaching, first at Sparta Prague and then at the Institutio Nacional del Deporte in Mexico (1979‚Äì1981). In 1989 he was reinstated in the Army, and served there until his death. In 1992‚Äì1993 he was commander of UN peacekeepers in Iraq (UNGCI) representing Czechoslovakia. Personal life and death At the 1964 Olympics Odlo≈æil became a close friend of the winner, Peter Snell, and after the Olympics visited him in New Zealand. Shortly after the 1968 Olympics, Odlo≈æil married the famous gymnast Vƒõra ƒå√°slavsk√°. The ceremony, which took place at the Mexico City Cathedral, drew a crowd of thousands. The couple had a son, Martin, and daughter, Radka. They divorced in 1987. On 7 August 1993 Odlo≈æil had a quarrel with his 19-year-old son. Martin hit him in the head, which resulted in a prolonged coma and death on 10 September 1993. Martin was sentenced to four years of imprisonment for his father's murder, but was granted a pardon by president V√°clav Havel in 1997, because the degree of fault on his father's death was not well proven. Since 1994 an athletic meet ‚Äì Josef Odlo≈æil Memorial () is held annually in his memory.

Description M. t. coronata, Chambal River, Uttar Pradesh, India Despite its name, the color of its upper shell or carapace can vary from reddish to dark brown and black with yellow streaks running along its length. The underside or plastron is uniformly brown in color. The face of this turtle may have yellow or orange marks and spots, with color varying between subspecies. The size of the species may vary from 38 to 45 cm. Distribution and habitat The species occurs in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Nepal, and the Chagos Archipelago, where it may have been introduced. There are five recognized subspecies with overlapping distributions: *M. t. trijuga: peninsula black turtle, India *M. t. coronata: Cochin black turtle, India *M. t. indopeninsularis: Bangladesh black turtle, India, Nepal *M. t. parkeri: Sri Lanka *M. t. thermalis: Sri Lanka black turtle, India, Maldives, Sri Lanka The Indian black turtle inhabits a variety of water bodies including ponds, marshes streams, rivers and artificial water bodies like rice-paddies, watering holes etc. Ecology In Nagarhole National Park The species is most active during early morning and evening, spending most of the day basking in the sun. The Sri Lankan subspecies, which has a flatter carapace, tends to spend the day in burrows. The species typically forages on aquatic vegetation along the edge of the water. It is omnivorous, with a diet ranging from aquatic plants to aquatic insects and carrion. Indian black turtles may sometimes be seen to aggregate alongside the carcass of a large dead animal. =Breeding= The Indian black turtle breeds during the wet season, between August to October. During this time the male becomes particularly aggressive and starts chasing the female, biting her on the neck. The male attaches itself to the top of the female during mating. Once mating is completed, the female digs a nest in the ground or occasionally in a pile of rhinoceros or elephant dung, using the left hind leg to excavate the nest and right hind leg to clear the excess material. Two to six individual clutches of eggs are laid in burrows per year. Eggs have an incubation period of 60‚Äì65 days, hatching during summer. Conservation The species is classified as least concern by the IUCN. M. t. indopeninsularis is considered threatened in Bangladesh, while the population in Myanmar (M. t. edeniana) is thought to be vulnerable or endangered. The species appears still to be common in India and Nepal, and is thus overall considered reasonably secure. Where it is under pressure, this is mostly due to hunting for consumption and the pet trade.

With Andries Pretorius, he led the Boers to a huge victory over the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River in 1838. In particular, Cilliers lead the Voortrekkers in a vow which promised that if God would protect them and deliver the enemy into their hands, they would build a church and commemorate the day of their victory as if it were an annual Sabbath day, which their descendants would also be instructed to honour. He was a prominent member of the Gereformeerde Kerk (Reformed Church), an offshoot of the Dutch Reformed Church. He is described as being a short, stout man, and was believed to have been very religious. He joined the Great Trek at the age of thirty-five.Potgieter: Chapter 4 of 'The Great Trek' The town of Kroonstad was, according to folklore, named after a horse belonging to Cilliers, which drowned in a stream (Kroonspruit) where the town is situated. There is a Sarel Cilliers Museum as well as a statue of him (on the site of the Dutch Reformed Church) in Kroonstad. Numerous streets and roads in Kroonstad and throughout South Africa are named after him. Early life Sarel Cilliers was born the fourth of seven children in Schoongezicht, Cape Colony to Carel Cilliers and his wife, Elizabeth Catherine Louw.2 In 1806 his parents sold Schoongezicht, when Cilliers was five years of age. From an early age he was well-acquainted with working life on the family farm, as he would often help with pastoral and elementary responsibilities. In his early life, he also developed a strong sense of community and religious duty. On Sundays, the neighbours gathered together to hold services and Holy Communion. It was in his childhood that Cilliers's religious values and aptitude for spiritual leadership were first developed, as he was said to have had a personal encounter with God at age 10. He would often share his faith with other children and encourage them to worship, and strengthen their bond with God. On 6 October 1823, Cilliers married Anna Francina Viljoen, the daughter of Christopher and Aletta Viljoen Booysen. Cilliers fathered eleven children from his marriage to Anna. During his younger years, Cilliers was of a slim build, and it was only later in his life around the time of the Great Trek that he became stouter in appearance. The Great Trek An artist's impression of the Battle of Blood River. In 1829, the Cilliers family moved to New Hantam (today Colesberg). In 1835, a drought hit the local area, and this led to Cilliers joining the Great Trek with his wife and six children in 1836, as he was convinced that it was God's will that he should go. Cilliers was made the unofficial pastor of the Great Trek, and he would hold services on a daily basis and give Sunday Communion. During the Great Trek he became distinguished as a spiritual leader, earning him such names as The Prophet of the Great Trek and The Father of Dingaansdag (Dingane's Day). In 1837, he was appointed to one of the two deacons of the first church council elected in the commissioned commandos. Renowned for his ability of boosting the morale of members of the Great Trek during times of hardship, he would often inspire troops through his recital of the Lord's Prayer during conflict. His skills of fortifying the troops were best displayed at the Battle of Blood River, where he spoke the famous vow to God on the battlefield, and held a thanksgiving service after the decisive victory over the Zulus. Cilliers' vow is celebrated as a national holiday in South Africa (Day of the Vow) on 16 December. Vow The Sarel Cilliers memorial in the grounds of the NG Moederkerk, Kroonstad. Cilliers is depicted standing on a gun carriage, making the Blood River vow. No verbatim record of the vow exists. The version often considered to be the original vow is in fact W.E.G. Louw's ca. 1962 translation into Afrikaans of G.B.A. Gerdener's reconstruction of the vow in his 1919 biography of Sarel Cilliers.Bailey 2003:25 The official journal of the emigrant Boers' punitive expedition against Dingane and his Zulus was published in De Zuid-Afrikaan of Friday 14 June 1839. The following entry for Sunday 9 December 1838 cites the vow as proposed by Andreas Pretorius: \\"Sondag, 9 Desember 1838 Des anderen daags, zynde de 9e, was alles nog rustig, en wy bleven hier over, om de Sabbath te vieren; terwyl ook de vorige Zaterdag avond, in de tent van de Hoofd-Kommandant, werd doorgebragt met 't zingen van enige gepaste liederen, en 'n kragtig gebed, door de heer Cilliers gedaan. Afl√™ van die Gelofte Des Zondags morgens, v√≥ordat de godsdienst begon, liet de Hoofd-Kommandant degenen (Cilliers, Landman en Joubert - see below) die de godsdienst zouden verrigten, by malkander komen, en verzocht hen, met de gemeente te spreken, dat zy allen volyverig in geest en in waarheid, tot God mogten bidden, om Zyne hulp en bystand, in het slaan tegen de vyand; dat hy aan de Almagtigen 'n gelofte doen wilde, (indien allen wel willen), - \\"om zo de Heere ons de overwinning geven mogt, 'n Huis tot zyns Grote Naams gedagtenis te stichten alwaar het Hem zal behagen,\\" - en dat zy ook moesten afsmeken, de hulp en bystand van God, om deze gelofte zeker te kunnen volbrengen, en dat wy de dag der overwinning, in 'n boek zullen aantekenen, om dezelve bekend te maken, zelfs aan onze laatste nageslachten, opdat het ter Eere van God gevierd mag worden. The three morning services were led by three men: De heeren Cilliers, Landman en Joubert, waren opgeruimd in het gemoed, om zulks te horen; zy onderhielden hunne gemeentens hierover en verkregen hunne algemene toestemming. Toen hierna de godsdienst onderscheidelik begon, nam de heer Cilliers dezelve in de tent van de Hoofd- Kommandant waar. Hy begon met het (laten) zingen uit Psalm 38 vers 12, 16, deed vervolgens het voorgebed, en sprak over de eerste 24 verzen van het 6e Kapittel uit Judicum of de Richteren; besloot vervolgens met het gebed, waarin de belofte voormeld aan God werd gedaan, en 'n krachtige smeking, om Gods hulp en bystand, in het volbrengen derzelve. Er werd weder gezongen, de 12e en 21e verzen van voorm. 38e Psalm, en hy besloot de godsdienst, door het zingen van Psalm 134. Na de middag werd weder 'n byeenkomst gehouden, en men zong verscheidene toepasselike verzen; de heer Cilliers maakte weder 'n aanspraak, en verrigte het openbare gebed; op welke wyze, ook de avond werd doorgebracht.\\" which in English literally means \\"Sunday, December 9, 1838 The next day, the 9th, everything was still quiet, and we stayed here to celebrate the Sabbath; while also the previous Saturday evening, in the tent of the Commander-in-Chief, was spent with the singing of some appropriate songs, and a powerful prayer, performed by Mr. Cilliers. Making that Vow On Sunday morning, before the commencement of religion, the Chief Commander sent those (Cilliers, Landman and Joubert - see below) who would practice the religion to come to Malkander, and asked them, to speak to the congregation, that all of them mightily persevere in spirit and in truth, praying to God for His help and assistance in striking the enemy; that he wanted to make a vow to the Almighty, (if all would like to), - \\"so that the Lord may give us the victory, to establish a House of Remembrance of his Great Name, where it will please Him,\\" - and that they also had to plead, the help and assistance of God, to be able to fulfill this vow surely, and that we will record the day of victory, in a book, to make it known, even to our last descendants, that The glory of God may be celebrated. The three morning services were led by three men: The Messrs. Cilliers, Landman and Joubert, were delighted to hear such; they maintained their congregations on this and obtained their general consent. When the religion began, respectively, Mr. Cilliers observed them in the tent of the Commander-in-Chief. He began with the singing of Psalm 38 verses 12, 16, then made the intercession, and spoke of the first 24 verses of the 6th Chapter from Judaism or the Judges; then decided with the prayer in which the promise made to God was made, and a powerful supplication, for God's help and assistance, in accomplishing it. They were sung again, the 12th and 21st verses of form. 38th Psalm, and he decided the religion, by singing Psalm 134. After the afternoon another meeting was held, and several appropriate verses were sung; Mr. Cilliers again made a claim, and performed public prayer; in what way, the evening was also spent\\" On 14 June 1839 his journal was published as a bilingual leaflet in De Zuid-Afrikaan, Cape Town; Dutch original on one side and the English translation on the other side.Journal der Ekspeditie van de uitgewekene Boeren, onder hunnen HoofdKommandant ANDREAS WILHELMUS JACOBUS PRETORIUS, (voormaals van Graaff-Reinet), tegen DINGAAN, Koning der Zulus, in de maand(en) November en December 1838; - ondernomen met oogmerk om wraak te nemen, wegens den wreedaardigste en onmenselikste moord van het gewezen Hoofd der Uitgewekenen, Pieter Retief, en zyne zestig medgezellen) en de daarop gevolgde onmenselike slagting, van mannen, vrouwen en kinderen, gepleegd door DINGAAN, en zyn volk; - alsmede ter herovering der goederen en bezittingen, by die gelegenheid door hen geroofd. Het Journaal is gehouden door de Hr. J.G. Bantjes,1 de Klerk des Volksraads, die gedurende de ekspeditie als Secretaris van den Hoofd-Kommandant, heeft geageerd:- Jan Gerritze Bantjes, penvoerder van die Voortrekkers. The wording of the Vow is: Afrikaans: Hier staan ons voor die Heilige God van hemel en aarde om ≈â gelofte aan Hom te doen, dat, as Hy ons sal beskerm en ons vyand in ons hand sal gee, ons die dag en datum elke jaar as ≈â dankdag soos ≈â Sabbat sal deurbring; en dat ons ≈â huis tot Sy eer sal oprig waar dit Hom behaag, en dat ons ook aan ons kinders sal s√™ dat hulle met ons daarin moet deel tot nagedagtenis ook vir die opkomende geslagte. Want die eer van Sy naam sal verheerlik word deur die roem en die eer van oorwinning aan Hom te gee. English: Here we stand before the holy God of heaven and earth, to make a vow to Him that, if He will protect us and give our enemy into our hand, we shall keep this day and date every year as a day of thanksgiving like a sabbath, and that we shall erect a house to His honour wherever it should please Him, and that we also will tell our children that they should share in that with us in memory for future generations. For the honour of His name will be glorified by giving Him the fame and honour for the victory. Later life After the victory at the Battle of Blood River, The Voortrekkers moved to Pietermaritzburg, and Cilliers moved to a farm in Welgevonden (now Colbourn), about north of Howick in Natal. By selling timber from the trees on his farm he was able to make a good income. Cilliers served in the Natalia Republic's first House of Assembly. As a member of Council, Cilliers played a large part in the creation of the Covenant Church in Pietermaritzburg in 1839. In 1843, after the British annexation of Natal, Cilliers withdrew from political life, maintaining an important role as an elder of the church. In 1847, Cilliers sold his farm and moved to the Orange Free State. Here he settled on the farm Doornkloof, in the Lindley district, where he allegedly built his homestead single-handedly. His wife was buried here at the time of her death in 1852. On 15 May 1854, he married Aletta Elizabeth Loots ‚Äì a thirty-three-year-old widow with whom he had one son. During the final years of his life, Cilliers was often ill. He died on 4 October 1871, and was buried in the Cilliers family cemetery, in a grave marked by a simple tombstone and later a monument. Legacy The Sarel Cilliers wagon-wheel bridge in Kroonstad. As well as numerous public places such as Sarel Cilliers High School, and the Sarel Cilliers wagon-wheel bridge being attached to Cilliers' name, he is also well-remembered by South Africans as a spiritual leader who was thought to have lived in close contact with God, and lived by the principles of his unfaltering faith. Although he is most famously remembered for speaking the Vow at the Battle of the Blood River, he was, in addition, an important progenitor of the early Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa. He is also seen as an exemplary example of a devout follower of his faith. He believed firmly in his religion with the utmost conviction, as best seen through his Vow. He is remembered as being a constantly determined, principled, and often selfless individual, shown through his ability to endure hardships to serve others in need. Overall he is seen as an important public and cultural figure who played an important role in Voortrekker history, the early history of Natal and the Orange Free State. The Cillier name The progenitor of the Cillier name in the region was a French Huguenot refugee named Josu√© Cellier from Orl√©ans, France who arrived in the Cape of Good Hope in 1700. Other variations of the name include: Celliers, Cilliers, Cilli√© and Sellier. Literary accounts G.B.A. Gerdener wrote a biography of Sarel Cilliers in 1919, which includes details of various events in his life and a reconstruction of the Vow.

(Taylor and Francis, printers). xxvii + 452 pp. + Plates I-XXVI. (Eublepharis hardwickii, pp. 119-120 + Plate XI, figure B). Biology Singh (1984) writes that the species E. hardwickii was common (in the 1970s) at Tikerpada, a village at 600m elevation on the banks of the Mahanadi river in the Satkoshia Gorge Sanctuary of Odisha. In the night, during summer and rains, these may be found on the forest roads or on open areas, and in the day several individuals were found underneath rocks and stones. He collected specimens from the Satkoshia Gorge and bred these in captivity at Tikarpada. In captivity E. hardwickii was found to be timid, allowing to be lifted by hand and accepting a variety of insects as diet. Prey were detected by their movements. At least one definite case of cannibalism was recorded in captivity ‚Äì mode of capture was from the neck and during swallowing the victim lay with its ventral side up. E. hardwickii never took water from a container in captivity; instead, they used to wait for an artificial shower to lick off drops falling on their head or sticking to the surfaces on the surroundings. The tongue is pinkish red, flat, thin and able to extend over to the eyes and head. One or two leathery eggs (approx. 20 x 10 mm) are laid and buried in soil. Eublepharis hardwickii is called the Kalakuta Sapa in Odisha (Oriya: Kalakuta = one which brings the message of death, and Sapa = snake). The local name originates from belief that these geckoes are highly poisonous, can climb trees (which these can) and after a bite the higher they climb the effect of the poison gets gradually intensified. The gecko makes a shrill vibrating noise when surprised.Singh LAK (1984). \\"Eublepharis hardwickii (Reptilia, Gekkonidae). The Kalakuta observed at Tikerpada, Odisha\\". J. Bombay Nat.

Context In the first two centuries of the Christian era, it was the local Roman officials who were largely responsible for the persecution of Christians. In the second century, the emperors treated Christianity as a local problem to be dealt with by their subordinates.Barnes, Timothy D., \\"Legislation Against the Christians,\\" Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 58 (1968) The number and severity of persecutions of Christians in various locations of the empire seemingly increased during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The extent to which Marcus Aurelius himself directed, encouraged, or was aware of these persecutions is unclear and much debated by historians. Traditional history The traditional account regarding Blandina is reported by Eusebius in his Historia Ecclesiastica. She belongs to the band of martyrs of Lyon who, after some of their number had endured frightful tortures, suffered martyrdom in 177 in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Almost all we know of Blandina comes from a letter sent from the Church of Lyon to the Churches of Asia Minor.Butler, Alban. Lives of the Saints, Vol. VI, 1866 Eusebius gives significant space of her life and death in his book as he quotes from the aforementioned epistle to Asia Minor.Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica, Book 5.2. The fanaticism of the Roman populace in Lyon had been excited against the Christians so that the latter, when they ventured to show themselves publicly, were harassed and ill-treated. While the imperial legate was away, the chiliarch, a military commander, and the duumvir, a civil magistrate, threw a number of Christians, who confessed their faith, into prison. When the legate returned, the imprisoned believers were brought to trial. Among these Christians was Blandina, a slave, who had been taken into custody along with her master, also a Christian. Her companions greatly feared that on account of her bodily frailty she might not remain steadfast under torture. But although the legate caused her to be tortured in a horrible manner, so that even the executioners became exhausted \\"as they did not know what more they could do to her\\", still she remained faithful and repeated to every question \\"I am a Christian, and we commit no wrongdoing.\\" Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"St. Blandina.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 23 Apr. 2013 Amphith√©√¢tre des Trois-Gaules, in Lyon. The pole in the arena is a memorial to the martyrs, including Blandina. Through fear of torture slaves had testified against their masters that the Christians when assembled committed cannibalism and incest, and the legate desired to wring confession of this misconduct from the Christian prisoners. In his report to the emperor the legate stated that those who held to their Christian belief were to be executed and those who denied their faith were to be released, and the legate received instructions from the Emperor Marcus Aurelius allowing the Roman citizens who persisted in the faith to be executed by beheading,Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica, Book 5.1.47 but those without citizenship were to be tortured. Blandina was therefore subjected to new tortures with a number of companions in the town's amphitheater (now known as the Amphitheatre of the Three Gauls) at the time of the public games. She was bound to a stake and wild beasts were set on her. According to legend, they did not, however, touch her. After enduring this for a number of days, in an effort to persuade her to recant, she was led into the arena to see the sufferings of her companions. Finally, as the last of the martyrs, she was scourged, placed on a red-hot grate, enclosed in a net and thrown before a wild steer who tossed her into the air with his horns. In the end, she was killed with a dagger. Legacy Blandine in St Irenaus Church, Lyon. * Her feast is celebrated June 2. * Two communes in France are named after her. See Sainte-Blandine.

Hydrogen is present practically everywhere, several kilometres above the earth and inside the earth. Engineering materials are exposed to hydrogen and they may interact with it resulting in various kinds of structural damage. Damaging effects of hydrogen in metallic materials have been known since 1875 when W. H. Johnson reported:W. H. Johnson, Proc. Royal Soc. Lond., 23 (1875), 168 ‚Äúsome remarkable changes produced in iron by the action of hydrogen and acids‚Äù. During the intervening years many similar effects have been observed in different structural materials, such as steel, aluminium, titanium, and zirconium. Because of the technological importance of hydrogen damage, many people explored the nature, causes and control measures of hydrogen related degradation of metals. Hardening, embrittlement and internal damage are the main hydrogen damage processes in metals. Hydrogen may be picked up by metals during melting, casting, shaping and fabrication. They are also exposed to hydrogen during their service life. Materials susceptible to hydrogen damage have ample opportunities to be degraded during all these stages. Classifications Hydrogen damage may be of four types: solid solution hardening, creation of internal defects, hydride embrittlement, and hydrogen embrittlement.T. K. G. Namboodhiri, Trans. Indian Inst. Metals, 37(1984), 764 Each of these may further be classified into the various damaging processes. = Solid solution hardening= Metals like niobium and tantalum dissolve hydrogen and experience hardening and embrittlement at concentrations much below their solid solubility limit.B. A. Kolachev, Hydrogen embrittlement of non-ferrous metals, Translated from Russian, Israel Program for scientific translations, (1968) The hardening and embrittlement are enhanced by increased rate of straining. = Hydride embrittlement= In hydride forming metals like titanium, zirconium and vanadium, hydrogen absorption causes severe embrittlement. At low concentrations of hydrogen, below the solid solubility limit, stress-assisted hydride formation causes the embrittlement which is enhanced by slow straining. At hydrogen concentrations above the solubility limit, brittle hydrides are precipitated on slip planes and cause severe embrittlement.W. J. Pardee and N. E. Paton, Metall. Trans. 11A (1980), 1391 This latter kind of embrittlement is encouraged by increased strain-rates, decreased temperature and by the presence of notches in the material. = Creation of internal defects= Hydrogen present in metals can produce several kinds of internal defects like blisters, shatter fracture, flakes, fish-eyes and porosity. Carbon steels exposed to hydrogen at high temperatures experience hydrogen attack which leads to internal decarburization and weakening.G. A. Nelson, in Hydrogen Damage, C. D. Beachem (Ed.), American Society for Metals, Metals Park, Ohio, (1977), p. 377 = Blistering = Atomic hydrogen diffusing through metals may collect at internal defects like inclusions and laminations and form molecular hydrogen. High pressures may be built up at such locations due to continued absorption of hydrogen leading to blister formation, growth and eventual bursting of the blister. Such hydrogen induced blister cracking has been observed in steels, aluminium alloys, titanium alloys and nuclear structural materials. Metals with low hydrogen solubility (such as tungsten) are more susceptible to blister formation Condon, J. B., and T. Schober. \\"Hydrogen bubbles in metals.\\" Journal of nuclear Materials 207 (1993): 1-24.. While in metals with high hydrogen solubility like vanadium, hydrogen prefer to induce stable metal-hydrides instead of bubbles or blisters. = Shatter cracks, flakes, fish-eyes and micro perforations = Flakes and shatter cracks are internal fissures seen in large forgings. Hydrogen picked up during melting and casting segregates at internal voids and discontinuities and produces these defects during forging. Fish-eyes are bright patches named for their appearance seen on fracture surfaces, generally of weldments. Hydrogen enters the metal during fusion- welding and produces this defect during subsequent stressing. Steel containment vessels exposed to extremely high hydrogen pressures develop small fissures or micro perforations through which fluids may leak. = Porosity = In metals like iron, steel, aluminium, and magnesium, whose hydrogen solubilities increase with increasing temperature, liberation of excess hydrogen during cooling from the melt, (in ingots and castings) produces hydrogen gas porosity. = Hydrogen embrittlement= By far, the most damaging effect of hydrogen in structural materials is hydrogen embrittlement. Materials susceptible to this process exhibit a marked decrease in their energy absorption ability before fracture in the presence of hydrogen. This phenomenon is also known as hydrogen-assisted cracking, hydrogen-induced blister cracking. The embrittlement is enhanced by slow strain rates and low temperatures, near room temperature.  Hydrogen stress cracking  Brittle delayed failure of normally ductile materials when hydrogen is present within is called hydrogen stress cracking or internal hydrogen embrittlement. This effect is seen in high strength structural steels, titanium alloys and aluminium alloys.  Hydrogen environment embrittlement  Embrittlement of materials when tensile loaded in contact with gaseous hydrogen is known as hydrogen environment embrittlement or external hydrogen embrittlement. It has been observed in alloy steels and alloys of nickel, titanium, uranium and niobium.  Loss in tensile ductility  Hydrogen lowers tensile ductility in many materials. In ductile materials, like austenitic stainless steels and aluminium alloys, no marked embrittlement may occur, but may exhibit significant lowering in tensile ductility (% elongation or % reduction in area) in tensile tests.  Degradation of other mechanical properties  Hydrogen may also affect the plastic flow behaviour of metals. Increased or decreased yield strengths, serrated yielding, altered work hardening rates as well as lowered fatigue and creep have been reported.  Control of hydrogen damage The best method of controlling hydrogen damage is to control contact between the metal and hydrogen. Many steps can be taken to reduce the entry of hydrogen into metals during critical operations like melting, casting, working (rolling, forging, etc.), welding, surface preparation, like chemical cleaning, electroplating, and corrosion during their service life. Control of the environment and metallurgical control of the material to decrease its susceptibility to hydrogen are the two major approaches to reduce hydrogen damage. Detection of hydrogen damage There are various methods of adequately identifying and monitoring hydrogen damage, including ultrasonic echo attenuation method, amplitude-based backscatter, velocity ratio, creeping waves/time-of-flight measurement, pitch-catch mode shear wave velocity, advanced ultrasonic backscatter techniques (AUBT), time of flight diffraction (TOFD), thickness mapping and in-situ metallography ‚Äì replicas.The Australian Institute for Non Destructive Testing (AINDT), Detection and Quantification of Hydrogen Damage For hydrogen damage, the backscatter technique is used to detect affected areas in the material. To cross-check and confirm the findings of the backscatter measurement, the velocity ratio measurement technique is used. For the detection of micro and macro cracks, time of flight diffraction is a suitable method to use.

The club was formed in 2000 after the merger of the two clubs of Paphos, APOP and Evagoras. AEP Paphos was dissolved on 9 June 2014, in order to be merged with AEK Kouklia and create a new team, Pafos FC. History APOP and Evagoras were the two clubs of Paphos playing sometimes in First and sometimes in the Second Division. In contrast with the other Districts of Cyprus and other major towns, which had permanent teams in First Division, Paphos did not have such a team as the two clubs could not remain in First Division for many years. For this reason the two clubs were merged to form AEP Paphos as the people of Paphos wanted a permanent team in First Division. When the two clubs joined to form AEP, APOP was in First Division, and managed to remain there, and Evagoras was in the Second division without managing to achieve promotion. Since APOP was in the First Division, the newly formed club of Paphos began its history from the First. They club remained in the first division until 2005, but soon had the luck of APOP and Evagoras when the team was for first time relegated to the Second Division. However, despite the fact that the team for the season 2005/06 was playing in the Second Division, on April 2006 they had their greatest success as a club since the team qualified for first time for the semi finals of Cypriot Cup (APOP reached the semi finals twice) by eliminating Olympiakos Nicosia. In the semi finals of the Cup they faced AEK Larnaca and despite the fact that Paphos was not beaten in none of the matches against AEK, they were eliminated with scores 1‚Äì1 at home and 0‚Äì0 away. The same season, AEP won the Second Division Championship and was promoted back to First division but after a very bad season were again relegated. The club had not justified the dreams of the people of Paphos of having a better team than APOP and Evagoras and to have a worthy team which will be permanent in the First Division. On 9 June 2014, AEP Paphos was merged with AEK Kouklia and created a new team, Pafos FC. Colours, badge and name APOP's original logo prior to merger Evagoras' original logo prior to merger The colours of the team were blue and white. These colours were chosen because they were both APOP and Evagoras' colours. The club's badge was a blue shield with some white lines and in the middle was the figure of Evagoras Pallikarides's as a face in a circle. Evagoras Pallikarides was a hero from Paphos who was hanged by British Colonists, as he was an EOKA guerilla, fighting for the freedom of Cyprus. From his name came the name, Evagoras FC, one of the two football clubs which were merged for AEP to be established. For this reason it was used in AEP's badge inside the blue badge with the white lines which was APOP's badge. APOP's name meant Athletic Football Club of Paphos (Athlitikos Podosferikos Omilos Pafou; ŒëŒ∏ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ Œ†ŒøŒ¥ŒøœÉœÜŒ±ŒπœÅŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ŒåŒºŒπŒªŒøœÇ Œ†Œ¨œÜŒøœÖ). Stadium The home ground of AEP Paphos, was the Pafiako Stadium, a multi-use stadium in Paphos. The capacity was 8000 seated spectators but in 2003 the ground was updated and expanded. It can now hold 11,000 fans.

Corea is a household name in Sri Lanka, synonymous with broadcasting and show business for over four decades, and has often been referred to as Sri Lanka's No. 1 Compere. Early life Vijaya Corea's grandfather was Victor Corea, a famed freedom fighter and a national hero of Sri Lanka. He grew up in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Vijaya Corea is the son of Dr.C.V.S. Corea and Amybelle Corea and the step-brother of Dr. Gamani Corea who was the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations. Corea's grandfather was the famed freedom fighter of Ceylon, Victor Corea. He is a direct descendant of King Dominicus Corea who was crowned King of Kotte and Sitawaka in 1596 by Vimala Drama Suriya, King of Kandy. Education The young Vijaya Corea was educated at the prestigious St Thomas' College, Mt. Lavinia. He was educated at the well known educational institution in Sri Lanka ‚Äì St. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. After he left school, Corea was planning to further his studies in Accountancy. Radio Corea joined the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon in 1964, lending his voice to the popular children's program Kiddies Corner. The American presenter, Craig Thompson, was unwell at the time, so Corea who was visiting Radio Ceylon was asked to step in, by his cousin Vernon Corea, despite having no prior broadcasting experience. He proved to be a natural, however, and lost no time in establishing himself as the most sought after commercial broadcaster. The impact of his voice and style before the microphone captivated the hearts of listeners. He joined Radio Ceylon at a time when the station was ruling the airwaves, right across the Indian sub-continent.The announcers of Radio Ceylon enjoyed star status in South Asia. Corea climbed the management ladder and in the 1990s he was appointed Director-General of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. While there, he succeeded in bringing a resurgence to Sri Lankan radio. Corea has been given numerous tributes and awards through the years. He is included in the list of notable individuals from the island of Sri Lanka. Vijaya Corea is widely recognised as a pioneer in the introduction of Sinhala pop music at Radio Ceylon and the English Service. He was the one man who allocated time for indigenous songs at Radio Ceylon, via his radio programmes such as Saturday Star and Lanka's Talent in Focus. He has continued that effort throughout his career and has extensive knowledge of the history of Sinhala pop groups and songs. Musicians of that era could not hold an event without Corea, as his presence was an absolute must for the introduction. He has The Distinction of being the first ever, to stand on the BMICH stage to present a musical evening and cultural pageant inaugurating the 5th Non- Aligned Summit Conference in the year 1976, which was designed for television and telecast 'live' on global television\\". He also holds the unbroken record of presenting 16 sponsored programs per week, Vijaya Corea was appointed Director ‚Äì General of the oldest radio station in South Asia, the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation in Colombo, in the 1980s. He served SLBC with distinction. Many professionals and others still recall how, in their youth, they would skip or delay attending classes in school and university to listen to Vijaya Corea's Morning Show programmes aired over radio. Vijaya Corea has introduced over one hundred pop musicians to the recording studios at then- Radio Ceylon. As one of his prot√©g√©s, the late Stanley Peiris, recounted: The \\"Fortunes,\\" led by Peiris, played a popular composition by Clarence Wijewardene, \\"Kalu Kelle,\\" on the twin saxophone. Wickremesuriya was convinced that the group would go far. While Peiris was directing music for Upul de Almeida's son Jude, he remarked with gratitude to the elder de Almeida, \\"If not for this man Vijaya, I would not be directing music for your son.\\" Television Vijaya Corea has the unique distinction of being Sri Lanka's first TV presenter. As a broadcaster, he single-handedly played an exclusive role in spotting gifted musicians and providing them a venue for their talents, thus opening doors for them to make both a career and a livelihood. Some of those who benefited from national exposure on his radio programmes include popular names such as Clarence Wijewardane, Annesley Malewana, Indrani Perera, the Gypsies and others too. Awards and recognition Star performers from Sri Lanka and abroad gathered together for the show Grand Salute to Vijaya Corea to pay a musical tribute to him on his 40th anniversary in electronic media and showbiz at the BMICH Conference Hall in Colombo on 6 August 2005. On that occasion, Sri Lankan star and London-based artiste Desmond de Silva presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to Corea from the Autism Awareness Campaign. In September 2007, he was f√™ted in Melbourne by Sri Lankan musicians living in that country who acknowledged his contribution to their careers. When the National Media Awards took place for the first time in Sri Lankan history, three Gold awards were given to: *Veteran journalist D. F. Kariyakarawana in honour of his contribution to newspaper journalism, *Titus Thotawatte, the veteran filmmaker in honour of his contribution to the television media, and *Vijaya Corea in honour of his contribution towards the upliftment of the broadcasting media over a long period of time. Personal causes Wherever Corea has travelled, he has done whatever he could to raise awareness of autism, a neuro-developmental disorder affecting many children and adults in Sri Lanka. Corea has supported the work of the Autism Awareness Campaign UK and Sri Lanka. Edirimanne Corea Family Union Vijaya Corea is the Patron of the Edirimanne Corea Family Union, in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

This involved the rebuilding of their aging fleet of EMD GP7, GP9, and GP18 road switchers (many of which were over twenty years old). 155 locomotives (122 GP7, 31 GP9 and two GP18) were rebuilt by the SCL. The program 155 locomotives were rebuilt by the Seaboard Coast Line. The vast majority of them came from Atlantic Coast Line, Seaboard Air Line and their subsidiaries (A&WP;, C&WC;, Georgia Railroad, WofA, WSSB) ; 8 units came from Clinchfield Railroad (with one of them ex NC&StL;), not counting the six units rebuilt at Paducah ; seven units came from Louisville & Nashville (including four ex-C&EI;). The required modifications took nine weeks per unit on average to complete. The rebuild work was done at the railroad's Uceta Shops near Tampa, Florida, with the engines, bogies and traction motors rebuilt at Waycross and Jacksonville. The program resulted in a cost savings of almost 50% over buying new locomotives. Included in the program: * Rebuilding the underframe assembly; * Remanufacturing the Blomberg B two-axle trucks, generators, and traction motors (all GP16s were configured with a B-B wheel arrangement); * Replacing the existing 567 prime mover with a new EMD 645 series diesel engine, which boosted the horsepower rating to 1,600 in the case of the former GP7 locomotives. This gave rise to the 16 designation. * Removal of the dynamic brakes, and installation of a new type 26L air brake system. * Installation of a new high-voltage cabinet. * Lowering the front nose of the carbody to improve visibility, and retrofitting with a new cab and standard AAR control stand. Ancillary benefits included a lowered engine idling speed and increased fuel efficiency. SCL committed over 100 of its personnel to the conversion program. The first GP16 emerged from SCL's Uceta (Tampa) shop in June 1979 while the last was placed into service during November 1982. In service The rebuilt locomotives saw service throughout the system, engaging in a variety of duties from local switching to main-line freight hauling. Though SCL became part of the CSX Transportation system in the 1980s, the majority of the units remained active until 1992, when the bulk of the roster was retired and sold-off. Many GP16s remain in active service today on short line railroads around the country, far exceeding their 15-year projected lifespan. In 1993 the U.S. Army bought a small number of GP16s from CSX, which led some people to think the Army built it. The locomotives were sent to Conrail's Juniata Locomotive shops to be 'remanufactured' under contract with the Army. When they were completed, Conrail put a GP9M plate on them. These locomotives are controlled by Woodward PGR type diesel engine governors. File:CSX 1710 at Atlanta, GA on June 10, 1987 02 (22741249726).jpgTwo CSX EMD GP16, still in SCL livery.

Other units called GP16 *In the late 1960s through the early 1970s, the Missouri Pacific Railroad repowered their entire roster of high-hood ALCO RS-11s with EMD 567 series diesel engines. These converted units were designated by the MP as \\"GP12s\\" and \\"GP16s\\" presumably to reflect their new horsepower rating. *Clinchfield Railroad had six GP7s rebuilt by ICG Paducah and they were called GP16s, but built to the same standard as ICG GP11s. When the CSX merger occurred these engines were grouped as GP16s. Two notable features was the angled cab and air intake filters.

The village was one of the ancient Muslim settlements along the western coast of India. The central mosque in Poovar was built by Malik Deenar, an eighth century Muslim preacher. During the reign of the Chola dynasty, Poovar was a major port. The explorer Megasthenes, Roman writer Pliny the Elder and Venetian traveller Marco Polo mention connections with Greece and Rome. There were a merchant named Pokku Moosa Maraikkar who lived in Poovar during the 18th century in a house called Kallaraickal Tharavad, which many times gave shelter to Marthanda Varma (1706‚Äì58), king of Travancore from his enemies. Poovar also had trade relations with international markets at this time as well as a well trained army and some ships. At the Battle of Colachel and Battle of Kayamkulam these forces assisted the Travancore army against the Dutch East India Company during the Travancore‚ÄìDutch War. The origin of the name \\"Poovar\\" has a story related to Marthanda Varma. Before that it was called Pokkumoosapuram. During internal riots in Travancore and while escaping from the Ettuveetil Pillamar (Lords of the Eight Houses), the king reached Poovar. It was a spring season and the trees on either sides of the Neyyar were full of flowers. These flowers fell into the river making it more attractive. On seeing this pleasant scenery, Marthanda Varma commented that this was poo-var, a conjunction of the Malayalam words for \\"flower\\" and \\"river\\".

This is achieved by photons to the extent that effects described by special relativity are able to describe those of such particles themselves. Several approaches exist as a means of describing the motion of single and multiple relativistic particles, with a prominent example being postulations through Dirac equations of single particle motion. Massive particles are relativistic when their kinetic energy is comparable to or greater than the energy mc^2 corresponding to their rest mass. In other words, a massive particle is relativistic when its total mass- energy (rest mass + kinetic energy) is at least twice its rest mass. This condition implies that the particle's speed is close to the speed of light. According to the Lorentz factor formula, this requires the particle to move at 86.6025% or more of the speed of light (the precise value is a consequence of the above characterization). Such relativistic particles are generated in particle accelerators,For example, at the Large Hadron Collider operating with a collision energy of 13 TeV, a relativistic proton has a mass-energy 6,927 times greater than its rest mass and travels at 99.999998958160351322% of the speed of light. as well as naturally occurring in cosmic radiation.An example of this is the Oh-My-God particle. In astrophysics, jets of relativistic plasma are produced by the centers of active galaxies and quasars. A charged relativistic particle crossing the interface of two media with different dielectric constants emits transition radiation. This is exploited in the transition radiation detectors of high-velocity particles.

Its digits are slender at the base, free, with squarish scales beneath, and large trapezoidal penultimate and distal expansions, the lower surface of each of which is covered by two large plates separated by a longitudinal groove; all the digits are clawed, the claw retractile is between the distal plates; in the inner digit, the penultimate expansion is absent. Its body covered above with small, granular scales, intermixed with larger tubercles; the abdominal scales are juxtaposed. the pupils are vertical. No preanal or femoral pores are present. Dorsal views of hand and foot. Ventral views of hand and foot. Its head is large, oviform, and very distinct from the neck; a strong, rounded supraorbital and canthal ridge is present; it has five deep concavities, a frontal, two postnasals, and two loreals; the snout is longer than the distance between the eye and the ear opening, 1.3 times the diameter of the orbit; the ear opening is vertical, measuring half the diameter of the eye. Its body is not much depressed. The limbs are long and slender. The width of the digital expansion measures about half the diameter of the eye. Its head is covered with very small granules, largest on the canthal ridges; the rostral is four-sided, twice as broad as high, and its posterior border is concave; its nostrils are pierced between the rostral, the first labial, and three nasals; the anterior is large and in contact with its fellow; 12 or 13 upper and as many lower labials occur; the mental is as large as the adjacent labials, or smaller than them; no regular chin-shields are found, but small, polygonal scales pass gradually into the granules which cover the gular region. Its upper surface is covered with minute granules; back with scattered, scarcely prominent, smooth, round, larger tubercles, hardly as large as the ventral scales; the latter flat, smooth, squarish, juxtaposed scales, arranged like the bricks of a wall. The tail is long, cylindrical, remarkably slender, and covered with squarish scales which are much larger beneath. In color, it is brownish-white above (golden during life), dotted or vermiculated with brown; the lower surfaces are whitish.Boulenger GA. 1890.

The species is endemic to South Asia. Geographic range S. arenarius is found in India (Rajasthan) and Pakistan (Karachi, Sindh). Description S. arenarius grows to a total length (including tail) of about 1 m (39 inches). Dorsally, it is cream-colored or pale buff, with darker spots arranged quincuncially. There is also a darker stripe on each side of the neck. Ventrally, it is uniform white.Boulenger GA (1893). Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History).

(Zamenis arenarius, p. 413 + Plate XXVIII, figure 2). Reproduction S. arenarius is oviparous. They do hibernate in the season of December to February and pairs start to mate in late March to April. Eggs are laid from May to July. A female weighing above 250 grams can produce a clutch of 7 to 10 eggs. A female finds a good spot for the incubation of eggs with a temperature of 28¬∞-30¬∞C and humidity around 80-95%. A female lays and burrow its eggs at the laying site, no parental care is observed. Each eggs weigh around 7 grams. eggs take around 60 days to hatch. babies are 15 cm in length and feeds on lizards or small rodents at the first stage of their life. alt=  In Captivity  Red spotted diadems are common in pet trade in Pakistan for their docile nature and their attractive color and pattern. In Pakistan they can be seen with snake charmers or individuals who keep them as their pets.  Breeding in captivity  Breeding red spotted diadem is easy in captivity but requires some simple steps. They require a proper cycle which contains cooling them in winters. Pair is heavily fed till November and left to hibernate. During their hibernation period you just have to leave a water bowl in their enclosure and a hiding spot. no light or heat source was used in this period. In February when temperature starts to increase you can offer them light to let them know its time to feed. when they are active again start offering them small meals and increase the frequency of offering meals to them to make them gain weight again.Captive Born specimen of red spotted diadem When they shed for the first time after hibernation its time to introduce them to each other but make sure to check their weights before it. A female should weight at least 250 grams or above and for a male at least 200 grams is preferred. Introducing them more than one time to make sure the pair has been successfully mated. Introducing them at night will help the chances of the pair to mate. copulation takes place for 25-20 minutes after it you can again separate the pair when the lose interest in each other. = Preparing an Incubator = A simple plastic air tight container can be used for the purpose of incubation. In lid small tiny holes are made for ventilation. equal amount of perlite and distilled water is mixed to make it moist. When pressed it should not drain water from it. put a humidity and temperature meter. a humidity of 80-90% is required. Temperature ranges from 28¬∞-30¬∞C. Place eggs in incubator without turning them. If you want you can candle them to make sure they are alive. Slugs or infertile eggs will turn yellow and catch mold, immediately remove them from your clutch. You should open your incubator after couple of days for 2 minutes for air exchange because eggs respire and you don't want them to die. After 54-60 days eggs will start to hatch. When your baby snakes are done with their first shed you can offer them a pinky mice References Further reading *Boulenger GA (1890). The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma.

Spanning 4 decades and with more than 50 musicians passing through its ranks, the band has moved into its second generation- as in, sons of the original members are operating as a separate four-piece that is still part of the original ensemble. Founded by Jag Barseghyan in the 1970s in Gyumri, Armenia, Bambir was lauded as one of the best rock groups in the Soviet Union, performing original material, traditional Armenian songs, and modern arrangements of Komitas and medieval Armenian music. Today, Jag Barseghyan records solo albums, ensemble albums, and performs with original members of The Bambir and other international musicians. In 1982 Bambir won the Folk Music Award at the International Festival in Lida, Belarus. They celebrated their 20th anniversary in Moscow in 1998 and in Gyumri at their first Biennial. On their 30th anniversary, they released Armenian Scotch,ARAJINLRATVAKAN. ‚ÄúAlbum Launch of Bambir‚Äôs Armenian Scotch‚Äù 1in.am. Retrieved on December 5, 2012. an album dedicated to the 140th anniversary of Hovhannes Tumanyan and the 250th anniversary of Robert Burns. A separate but connected four-piece rock band The Bambir (Progressive Ethnic Rock'n'Roll) formed in Gyumri later in 1994, by Narek (son of Jag), Arman Kocharyan, Arik Bambir Grigoryan and Vardan Paremuzyan. While they started playing together in Armenia, they've earned a reputation in Russia, France, the United States, Turkey, and beyond. They have been based in Ireland as of January 2012. They write and perform their own music written by Narek and Arik, and are known for their vibrant stage presence in their live shows and unique sound. Early history In the sixties Jag began traveling to the city of Gyumri, traditionally Armenia's city of arts and one of the cultural centers of the Soviet Union. While there weren't many people listening to rock music in Yerevan at the time, an underground scene seemed to be thriving in Gyumri. It was there that he began to find like-minded individuals and appreciators of the music he loved. He started jamming with Robert Kocharyan (not the former Armenian president) on bass, Suren Martirosyan on guitar, and Levon \\"Watts\\" Nouroyan on drums, calling themselves Angin Qarer (\\"precious stones\\", in the Armenian language), playing hard rock. They soon morphed into their folk \\"bard rock\\" style, arranging pieces by Komitas and moving on to their own original material, changing their name to Bambir. Performances and many albums followed and they toured Armenia, Russia, Europe and the United States. Members of the original band reunite for special concerts, and Jag continues to actively record and collaborate with local and international artists. He has been awarded by the Armenian Ministry of Culture for his achievements in Contemporary Armenian Music. Second Generation Narek (son of Jag) and Arman (son of Robert Kocharyan, an original member of \\"Angin Qarer\\"), friends since birth, grew up in Gyumri in the creative environment built by their fathers and community.Kavanagh, Paul. ‚ÄúSome Words With The Bambir chewyourownfat.wordpress.com. Retrieved on December 5, 2012. They picked up the guitar and bass at a very young age. They met Arik (flute) when they were nine years old, and their trio began jamming and performing on their own. In 1999-2000 they travelled to Los Angeles and New York, and even recorded an album (never released) in California but had to return to Armenia, and school. Ashot Korganyan joined them on drums in 2001. As the boys grew up in Gyumri they became better musicians and started playing more and more. The four-piece returned to Los Angeles in 2007, and Ashot left the band upon their return. That same year, the now trio travelled to Shoushi in Artsakh for a music festival and Narek, Arman, and Arik met Vardan, originally from Vanadzor, Lori region. They continue to work with Jag. The band's notoriety grew as they finished university and continued to gig, and they started to attract international attention. They played in Moscow, Paris, Istanbul, Beirut, Georgia, and all over Armenia, placing third in 2010's Eurovoice Competition. They made the decision to make a go of breaking into the European market, and moved to Dublin in January 2012.

Biography Otsason grew up in southern Estonia. After obtaining secondary education he came to study in Tallinn and graduated in 1954 from Tallinn Polytechnical Institute as an economist. He became one of the leading researchers on economics, being finally nominated as the Director of the Institute of Economics at the Estonian Academy of Sciences. Otsason completed a doctorate in economics in 1984. From 1988 to 1989 he worked as the Head of the State Plan Committee of the Estonian SSR. Those were the years of political and economical liberation, the beginning of breaking away from the Soviet system. On 15 December 1989 the Estonian government decided to establish the Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank). On 28 December 1989 the Bank Law of the Republic of Estonia was passed and Otsason was appointed the first President of the Bank of Estonia. On 1 January 1990 the Bank of Estonia began its work as independent bank of issue. =Bank of Estonia= Otsason led the Bank of Estonia in its very first years when legal acts regulating the activities of the bank were created and monetary reform to re-establish Estonian kroon as the national currency of Estonia was prepared. On 15 March 1990 the Statutes of the Bank of Estonia were approved; on 15 May 1990 the procedure for establishment of commercial banks was established. The programmes for transition to national currency were finished in November 1990 and next year started the preparations for monetary reform. Otsason participated in the work of Monetary Reform Committee established on 27 March 1991 and led by Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar. He signed on 10 May 1991 a contract with the company Thomas De La Rue & Co Ltd. for printing banknotes of Estonian kroons. Although his work was crucial for the success of monetary reform, he was not the one to supervise the reform. His wish to postpone the monetary reform until a way will be found to alleviate social problems caused by the reform led to confrontation with his superiors and on 23 September 1991 he was replaced with Siim Kallas. The reform took place on 20 June 1992. Otsason and Siim Kallas are often called the \\"fathers of Estonian kroon\\". Otsason was decorated by the President of the Republic with the Estonian Order of the Coat of Arms, 4th class (2003). =Estonian Credit Bank= Otsason started to work on creating his own bank. The commercial bank known as Estonian Credit Bank (Eesti Krediidipank) was established on 15 March 1992. Otsason was the leader of the bank from its establishment till his death, first as the Chairman of the Board and since 2000 as the Chairman of the Council. He and his wife Valentina Otsason were also the main shareholders of the Estonian Credit Bank. Using his extensive knowledge and connections he managed to maintain the bank even during the economical and financial crisis of 1997-1999 when numerous small financial institutions went bankrupt. As the President of the Estonian Credit Bank he was also a board member of the Estonian Banking Association (Eesti Pangaliit). In 2003 Otsason started co- operation with the Bank of Moscow, which obtained 18,69% of the shares of the Estonian Credit Bank through its subsidiary company Latvian Business Bank. After Otsason's death, the Latvian Business Bank became a major shareholder of the Estonian Credit Bank, obtaining 60% of shares on 2 August 2005. =Politics= Otsason was a member of the Union for the Republic - Res Publica and was a candidate at the 2003 Estonian parliamentary election. He was elected to the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu), but turned down his seat and decided to continue his work in the bank.

Ballymoney is 15 km to the north-west and Ballymena is 16 km to the south. It had a population of 1,309 people in the 2011 Census. It is in Causeway Coast and Glens District Council. Name The name Cloughmills/Cloghmills is a combination of the Irish word cloch (meaning \\"stone\\") and the English word mill (referring to the linen mill around which the village grew). An older spelling was Clochmills.Tour through Ireland: Particularly the interior and least known parts, Volume 2. Printed for R.P. Moore, 1813. Features Cloghmills is a local service centre for its surrounding rural hinterland with a good range of retail, commercial, community and educational facilities. Recreational facilities are, however, limited, relative to the size of the village. A substantial number of private sector dwellings have been built over the past decade, which reflect its growing residential function. Three private housing developments have been built in the village, substantially increasing the population to approximately 2000 individuals in 2008. The Cloughmills Community Action Team (CCAT), made up of local residents, is in the process of reviving a five-year action plan to develop the village for the all who live there, and promote and develop local business initiatives. Cloughmills is home to one of Northern Ireland's leading department stores, Logans of Cloughmills. History The industrial heritage of the village can be seen from the old linen mill which is located at the bottom end of the main street beside the medical centre. The mill was fed by the Cloughwater (also known as the Cloughmills Water) river which flows through the southern end of the village. This river feeds into the River Main. In 1910, corn and flax scutching were the main industries and an Agricultural and Dairy Society and Co-operative Poultry and Egg Society had been established. The population was about 200. The former main employer of the village, Cooneen Textiles, a clothing firm, closed down in 1999 with the loss of 128 jobs. The premises changed hands and Cooneen was replaced by a haulage company called Reid Transport. In November 2007 Reid Transport ceased trading with loss of 200 jobs following serious financial difficulties. The African Clothing Company took up residence in the vacated premises later changing its name to All-Tex Recyclers. =The Troubles= On 12 February 1977, an off duty Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) member, Samuel McKane (aged 33), was killed by the IRA outside his home in Cloughmills.Samuel McKane: CAIN List of deaths 1977, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 23 October 2015. On 14 March 1978, Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) masked gunmen planted two explosive devices at the Cloughmills Cooperative Society and Spar supermarket complex. The gunmen fired two shots in the air and escaped by car. The homemade explosive devices exploded causing minor structural damage and starting a fire which destroyed the interior. Transport Cloughmills has good road links to Ballymoney and Ballymena and is located a short distance east of the A26 key transport corridor. However, it has limited public transport connections.

He was particularly involved in work on desalinisation. =Political career= His father, Yosef Sprinzak, was a politician in the early days of the state, and was a member of the Knesset for the left-wing Mapai, as well as being the first Knesset speaker. In contrast, Yair became involved in right-wing politics, joining the Movement for Greater Israel and becoming a member of its directorate. He was active in the Tehiya party, and was one of the founders of Moledet in 1988. In the same year he was elected to the Knesset on Moledet's list.

Coaching career  Todd first coached his old club South Fremantle as a captain-coach in 1959, then after his retirement as a player, from 1966 to 1968, after which he wrote for The West Australian during the 1970 season. He then coached East Fremantle from 1973 until 1976, including winning the 1974 premiership. In 1977 he moved to Swan Districts, where he coached for eleven seasons winning a hat-trick of premierships between 1982 and 1984. While at Swans in 1982, Todd caused controversy by sending a team of reserves and colts to Melbourne to compete in the Escort Cup quarter-final against VFL club . Todd's actions were in protest to a change of the quarter final schedule, which he felt would be detrimental to his senior team's performance in the WAFL. The inexperienced team lost by 186 points, and Swan Districts was banned from the Escort Cup for two years. In October 1987, Todd was due to fly to Adelaide to sign with SANFL club Woodville. But the management of the fledgling managed to get hold of him first and secure his signature as coach for the 1988 VFL season after they had just sacked Ron Alexander. One of Todd's first moves as coach of West Coast was to field almost two different teams: one to play at home in Perth and one to play interstate. While there would be a nucleus of key players for all the matches, Todd declared that he would pick his teams for interstate matches based on who could cope best with the different conditions. The idea seemed reasonable, based on the previous season's results; in their first year of VFL football, of the 11 games the Eagles had won, only two of them were away from home. Todd also perceived that the players had treated the interstate trips as holidays, and so he organized travel arrangements to be as short as possible, with players departing Perth late on Friday and then returning home after the game. He was the first coach to take West Coast into the finals in 1988, losing the Elimination Final to by two points. After a mediocre year in 1989 he was succeeded by Mick Malthouse. Todd returned to Swan Districts, taking the team to a premiership in his first year back in 1990, before moving back to his original team, South Fremantle in 1995. He coached them to the 1997 premiership before leaving again after the 1998 season, taking a year off from coaching. In 2000 he made his final move, back to Swan Districts, before finally retiring at the end of 2002. In August 2001 he became the first West Australian and the fourth Australian to coach 700 senior games. The Parliament of Western Australia suspended its standing orders to pass a motion of congratulation to Todd for his contribution to Australian rules football.John Todd, Contribution to Australian rules football (2 August 2001) In addition to his 721 league games as coach, Todd also coached Western Australia for 14 games, to take his total to 735 games. He also coached six International Rules tests for Australia. In all, Todd coached in seven Grand Finals, winning six of them. He felt though that the one defeat was with the best team he had coached - the 1980 Swan Districts team, which won their first 13 games during the home-and-away season but lost to South Fremantle in the Grand Final.Collins, 2006, p. 349 Todd was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2003 as a coach and is a legend of the West Australian Football Hall of Fame.

Making use of new technologies at the time, such as USB and FireWire, Device Bay was intended to make adding and removing devices from the PC easier, through the use of plug-n-play. It allowed peripherals such as hard drives, CD/DVD-ROM drives, audio devices, and modems, to be added to the PC without having to open the case or even turn the PC off. Devices could also be removed from the PC while it was still turned on; this could also be done through software in the operating system. Another advantage of Device Bay was that it allowed certain devices to be swapped between a desktop and laptop computer.

It was the author's first novel. Originally published by Faber & Faber, it was published in the U.S. by Criterion Books as Starship in 1959. The novel has been frequently republished in the UK and US and translated into French, German, Danish and other languages.Formats & Editions at WorldCat The Signet and Avon US paperback editions were also published under the title Starship, but American publishers Carroll & Graf and Overlook Press have used the title Non-Stop.Non- Stop at ISFDB Plot summary The novel's protagonist, Roy Complain, lives in a culturally-primitive tribe in which curiosity is discouraged, and life is solitary, poor, and short. With a small group, he leaves his home and ventures into uncharted territory. The consequent discoveries will change his perception of the entire universe. Complain's small tribe roam nomadically through corridors overrun by vegetation. After his wife is kidnapped, a tribal priest, Marapper, encourages Complain to join a furtive expedition into the unexplored corridors. It is Marapper's belief that they are all living on board a moving spacecraft and that if they can reach the control room, they will gain command of the entire gargantuan vessel. On their journey, the group encounters other tribes of varying levels of sophistication. Complain is also briefly captured by humanoid 'Giants' of legend, who release him with no explanation. Complain's party eventually join the more sophisticated society of the 'Forwards'. Here, they learn that the space-craft is a multi- generational starship returning from a newly colonised planet in the Procyon star system. In a previous generation, the ship's inhabitants had suffered from a pandemic because of an alien amino acid found in the waters of the Procyon planet. Law and order began to collapse, and knowledge of the ship and its purpose was eventually almost entirely lost throughout the vessel. Since the 'Catastrophe', 23 generations have passed so far. The Forwards have uncertain knowledge of 'Giants', who, though feared, are generally considered to be benevolent. Other mysterious beings, 'Outsiders', are thought to infiltrate the human world from an unknown place and are reviled as enemies. However, when the Giants attack a Forward crew-member, the humans conclude that the Giants and Outsiders are colluding against humanity and prepare to retaliate in force. Meanwhile, Complain and his developing romantic interest Vyann (a Forward officer) learn that the spacecraft should have taken only six generations to return to Earth. Aware that 23 generations have passed since the epidemic, they despairingly deduce that the entire spacecraft is now plummeting into the cold expanse of infinite space. Although they find the ship's control centre, all of its mechanisms have been destroyed. The Forwards briefly engage the Giants, but the conflict quickly ends. It is then revealed that the ship has been moored outside Earth's atmosphere for a number of years. The 'Giants' are merely normal-sized Earth-humans who have been attempting to improve the conditions of the ship's inhabitants by slowly repairing the vessel. The 'Outsiders' are unusually-short humans from Earth who have infiltrated the ship's various societies to study the development of their civilization. The rulers of Earth have been reluctant to integrate the ship-dwellers into Earth's civilization because the epidemic survivors have mutated to live four times faster than Earth's population. However, the recent battle on board the spacecraft has caused it to begin an emergency split into its composite parts, ensuring that the entire population will now be granted a new start on Earth.

Despite being derived from Chinese cuisine, Korean Chinese cuisine consists of unique dishes with Korean flavors and ingredients. Most Korean Chinese restaurants in and outside South Korea are owned and operated by Koreans rather than ethnic Chinese. In South Korea, the food is usually delivered. In the United States and elsewhere, Korean Chinese dishes are served in Korean restaurants and not Chinese restaurants. Some Korean Chinese dishes such as jjamppong and udong have names etymologically from Japanese, but the dishes themselves are not originated or influenced by Japanese or Japanese Chinese cuisine. The Japanese language- influenced names are the result of Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th century, when the use of Korean language was prohibited and Japanese was the language used in menu items of high-end Chinese restaurants in Korea.  Characteristics  The cuisine was first developed during the 19th century in the port city of Incheon, where most of the ethnic Chinese population of Korea lived. Due to geographic proximity and the demographics of the Korean Chinese population, most Korean Chinese dishes are derived from (or influenced by) northern, eastern and northeastern Chinese dishes mostly from Shandong, where the majority of the earlier Chinese immigrants in Korea were from. Chinese restaurants in Korea are unusual in that most are owned and operated by Koreans, rather than ethnic Chinese. This was because the assimilation of the ethnic Chinese into Korean culture and their emigration due to legal discrimination, particularly under the Park Chung-hee administration. Consequently, the most authentic Korean Chinese cuisine may be found in overseas Korean communities. The food is primarily delivered, comparable to pizza delivery in the US or Indian take-away in the UK, and is similarly priced relative to other dining options. Chinese dishes, also popular in South Korea, are generally served at upscale Chinese restaurants rather than Korean Chinese establishments.  Dishes  Three primary Korean Chinese dishes are served in most Korean Chinese restaurants in South Korea and elsewhere: * Jajangmyeon () is a noodle dish topped with a thick sauce made of sweet bean sauce (chunjang), diced pork or seafood, and vegetables. Derived from the Shandong zh√°ji√†ngmi√†n (), Korean jajangmyeon is distinct from the zh√°ji√†ngmi√†n dishes served in China. * Jjamppong () is a spicy noodle soup flavored with vegetables, meat or seafood, and chili oil. The dish derived from the Shandong ch«éom«émi√†n () and its name derived from chanpon, a Japanese Chinese dish derived from the Fujian m√®nmi√†n (). The addition of chili powder (gochugaru) and chili oil to jjamppong began during the 1960s. * Tangsuyuk () is a Korean version of a sweet and sour meat dish derived from the Shandong t√°ngc√πr√≤u (). It can be made with pork or beef, coated with corn- or potato starch or glutinous rice flour. The dish is served with a sweet-and-sour sauce typically made with soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, corn- or potato starch and fruits and vegetables such as carrots, cucumbers, onions, wood ear mushrooms, apples and pineapples. Other dishes often served in Korean Chinese restaurants include: * Jungguk-naengmyeon (; ), literally \\"Chinese cold noodles\\", is enjoyed during the summer. Jungguk-naengmyeon is made with junghwa-myeon (Chinese noodles), shredded five-spice marinated beef or pork (‰∫îÈ¶ôÈÜ¨ËÇâ), cucumber, crab sticks, jellyfish and a fried egg in a cold chicken broth seasoned with soy sauce and spices. A sauce, mixed with mustard and peanut sauce, gives it a nutty, spicy flavor.Seo, Won-ye (ÏÑúÏõêÏòà), (2009-06-12)ÎÉâÎ©¥Îßå Î®πÏûêÎãà ÏßÄÍ≤πÏ£†‚Ä¶ÏÉâÎã§Î•∏ 'Ïó¨Î¶ÑÈ∫µ' Ïñ¥ÎïåÏöî (in Korean), Hankguk Gyeongju * Kkanpunggi (, derived from g√†n pƒìng jƒ´ /), fried chicken (with or without bones) glazed with a sweet, spicy sauce * Kkanpung saeu (Korean: ÍπêÌíçÏÉàÏö∞): Deep-fried, breaded sweet-and-sour shrimp, with a mild spiciness distinct from tangsuyuk, tangsu saeu and the stir-fried Kung Pao shrimp served in Chinese restaurants. Kkanpung saeu is served with a sweet sauce, peas, carrots, green onions and red chilli peppers. * Rajogi (, derived from l√†jiƒÅojƒ´ /), similar to the Sichuan laziji, a Chinese chilli chicken dish * Udong (), a noodle soup similar to jjamppong but with non-spicy white soup, derived from Sandong-style d«él«îmi√†n (ÊâìÂç§Èù¢/ÊâìÊª∑È∫µ) and not related to Japanese udon despite the name. * Ulmyeon (Korean: Ïö∏Î©¥), similar to udon, consists of wheat- flour noodles, chopped vegetables and seafood in a chowder-like broth thickened with cornstarch. It is derived from a Chinese dish, wƒìnl≈≠mi√†n (). Dumplings are also served at Korean Chinese restaurants, usually a pan-fried cross between Chinese jiaozi and Korean mandu. Dried red-chili flakes are provided to season food or mixed with soy sauce. Koreans traditionally eat Chinese food with a side dish of danmuji (yellow pickled radishes) and raw onion dipped in unfried chunjang. Kimchi, a Korean staple, is also eaten with Chinese food.

Music Junkanoo is a large contributor to the music of The Bahamas. It is a type of street carnival which occurs on December 26 (Boxing Day) and New Year's Day (January 1). This traditional celebration was started with an African slave by the name of John Canoe. Slaves were given a special holiday at Christmas time, when they could leave the work of the plantation behind and celebrate their freedoms. The parades are characterized by spectacular costumes made of crepe paper and powerful rhythms beaten traditionally on goatskin drums (accompanied more recently with tom-tom drums or bongo drums) as well as rich brass bands and shaking cow bells. Bahamian music also incorporates other Caribbean forms such as calypso, Trinidadian soca and Jamaican reggae Calypso and Rake 'n' Scrape singers and bands such as Baha Men have gained massive popularity in Japan, the United States and elsewhere. Bahamian music continues to be enjoyed by the Bahamian public, with singers such as the late Ronnie Butler, the late \\"King\\" Eric Gibson, K.B, Macklyn, and the Brilanders.  Language  English is the official language of the Bahamas. A vast majority of the population speaks Bahamian Dialect, which is a dialect of English intermediate between Standard English and Bahamian Creole. There are some minor regional differences from island to island in terms of pronunciation, but generally all are the same. =African influence= In Bahamian dialect, some African words and expressions have been retained, such as: # yinna - you (plural) # nanny -(v.n.)- feces or the act of defecation # cut eye - an expression found in many Caribbean and Atlantic creoles, meaning to glare, literally q or 'cut' your eyes /roll your eye # Jumbay - ghost, related to the Kongo word nzumbi of similar meaning # Yam - to eat, still in use in some southern and eastern islands, related to the African word nyam' # Bey - meaning boy or a young boy or young lady Literature The first known published work by a Bahamian is \\"A narrative of facts, relative to the conduct of Vice-Admiral Gambier, during his late command in North America published in 1782\\", it was written by James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier who was born on New Providence Island in The Bahamas in 1756.James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier The first known Black author from the Bahamas was a John Boyd who wrote a book of poetry called \\"The Vision and Other Poems in Blank Verse.\\", it was published in 1834. The population of the Bahamas is 95% Christian, of various denominations, primarily Methodist, Baptist, Anglican and Catholic. There are more churches per capita than in any other country. Bahamians' religious enthusiasm and high regard for education are a consequence of their Puritan heritage, derived from the Eleutheran Adventurers.http://www.traveldocs.com/bs/culture.htm Religion is an integral part of Bahamian life.....of their Puritan heritage =Storytelling= Storytelling and folklore played a large role in the traditional entertainment of Bahamian communities, particularly before the advent of modern television. Many of these highly amusing tales also carry wise lessons. Bahamian storytelling has witnessed some revival, through the works of Patricia Glinton-Meicholas and other authors. Storytelling is one of the customs influenced by African cultures, e.g. in the stories of Ber Bouki and Ber Rabbi, etc. Bush medicine has been practised since the times of slavery in the Bahamas. It is still used today to cure many diseases, using local plants. Arts =Straw weaving= Nassau. Traditional crafts include straw work on islands, creating beautiful hats and baskets. This skill was useful when Bahamians led subsistence lifestyles, with baskets being used for carrying fruit and fishing traps. Today, straw work and wood carvings are produced and sold to tourists in Nassau's Straw Market. =Canvas art= Beautiful landscapes and the vibrant houses and peoples of the Bahamian archipelago have inspired many artists, both native and foreign.

Ruiz reached international fame across Latin America, Europe and among Hispanic music fans in the United States. Biography Rey Ruiz demonstrated a lot of interest in becoming a salsa singer since he was a small child. Aside from an apparently normal childhood, Ruiz made his debut as a performer at a very young age; he was often showcased on Cuban television as a child, singing typical children's songs. Ruiz had his parents' full support, he was later on enrolled in Havana's Conservatorio de M√∫sica school. Eventually, Ruiz made his way to headlining a show at the Habana Libre Hotel. Rey Ruiz performed in the well known \\"Cabaret Tropicana\\" music group. During a Cabaret Tropicana tour in the Dominican Republic, Ruiz defected, leaving the group to join some friends in the United States. Once established there, Ruiz began to gain fame as a solo salsa singer. It took Ruiz three years after he arrived in the United States for him to release his first CD. The self-titled \\"Rey Ruiz\\" was produced by Sony Records and it earned Ruiz celebrity in such places as Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Panama and Venezuela. The album also earned Ruiz a number of Billboard and Premios Lo Nuestro awards (including Tropical New Artist of the Year), and it was a platinum album. Rey Ruiz was named the \\"salsa singer of the year\\" for 1993 by a prestigious salsa music magazine and was known for hits such as \\"No Me Acostumbro\\" and \\"Amiga\\". Ruiz's initial success as a singer translated into small screen success as well, as he was hired by Pepsi, Miller beer and his studio company, Sony, to film commercials announcing their brand. Ruiz's second album was a various artists' compilation dedicated to salsa singers from the 1960s and 1970s. The tribute album was named \\"Los Soneros de Hoy\\". loosely translated into \\"Today's (salsa) performers\\". Also in 1993, Ruiz released his second album. \\"Mi Media Mitad\\" (\\"My Other Half\\") was a large hit in the United States and in Europe, once again, making the Billboard hits list in the States, and topping the European charts. \\"Mi Media Mitad\\" became Ruiz's second consecutive platinum album, and it helped make Ruiz popular in Colombia as well, with a single, \\"Si te Preguntan\\" (\\"If They Ask You\\") becoming a major hit song. Soon after that album's release, Ruiz made his debut at New York's Madison Square Garden. The same year, Ruiz earned the New Tropical/Salsa Artist of the Year award at the Lo Nuestro Awards. Ruiz's third album, \\"En Cuerpo y Alma\\" (\\"Body and Soul\\"), was released in 1995. This was Ruiz's third platinum album in a row; his songs \\"Estamos Solos\\" (\\"We Are Alone\\") and \\"Vuelve de Nuevo Conmigo\\" (\\"Return Once Again With Me\\") were international hits, and many salsa experts consider this album to be Ruiz's most important release. In 1996, with the collaboration of famed Colombian songwriter Omar Estefano and of Ricardo Quijano, Ruiz released his fourth consecutive platinum album, named \\"Destino\\" (\\"Destiny\\"). One of the most publicly acclaimed songs in that album was \\"Mi√©nteme Otra Vez\\" (\\"Lie to me Again\\"). His next album, 1997's \\"Porque es Amor' (\\"Because it is Love\\") failed to have the commercial success Ruiz's four previous releases had, ending Ruiz's streak of platinum albums at four. It did, however, contain three major hit songs, including the title song, as well as \\"Mi Angel\\" (\\"My Angel\\") and \\"T√∫ no Sabes\\" (\\"You Don't Know\\"). In 1998, Ruiz released a greatest hits CD, named \\"Exitos del Rey\\" (\\"Rey's Hits\\", a name which can also be interpreted as \\"The King's hits\\", since Rey means king in Spanish). By then, Ruiz owned a recording company; his next album, \\"Ya Ves Quien Soy\\" (\\"Now You See Who I Am\\"), becoming one of the first CDs to be released by Ruiz's Luna Negra (\\"Dark Moon\\") record label. \\"Ya Ves Quien Soy\\" was another commercial success for Ruiz, particularly in Brazil. Ruiz collaborated with Brazilian singer Jos√© Augusto in this album, when the pair recorded a duet song, \\"Siempre M√≠a\\" (\\"Always Mine\\"). In 2000, Ruiz joined the Bohemia Records label, releasing \\"Fenomenal\\" (\\"Phenomenal\\") under that label. In 2004, he released Mi Tentacion. In 2008 Ruiz fulfilled a lifetime dream by performing on stage with some of his closest musical colleagues at the Adrian Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami. Along with Grammy Winner Arturo Sandoval, Objectivo Fama winner Marlon and Los Tres de La Habana, this musical collaboration was recorded for a soon to be released DVD. Ruiz signed on to a new recording contract which brings him back to his original label Sony/BMG with a highly anticipated album being produced by Cuco Pena one of Puerto Rico's premier musical producer.

The primary source for her life-story is the Mahavamsa. She is venerated as Maha Loku Kiriammaleththo by the Veddas. Other names for her varying with Veddas habitats are Indigolle Kiriamma, Unapane Kiriamma, Kande Kiriamma, Divas Kiriamma, Wellasse Kiriamma, Kukulapola Kiriamma and Bili Kiriamma. Kuveni was a wife of Sri Lanka's first recorded king Vijaya and she had two children, a son named Jeevahatta and the daughter as Disala. According to the genesis myth of the Sinhalese people, recorded in the Mahavansa, the Veddas - Sri Lanka aboriginal population are descended from Kuveni's children. Kuveni, on the other hand, is regarded as a descendant of the Rakshas of the Ramayana and of Ravana, who also dwelled in Lanka. According to Dayananda Binaragama another prevalent legend about Kuveni among the Veddas is that she is the elder sister of deity Saman. For the Veddas, Devas too were and are another living tribe. Legend According to the Mahavamsa, Vijaya's arrival in Sri Lanka is said to have coincided with the passing away of the Buddha. Indeed, the very first 'person' that Vijaya supposedly encounters on the island is the God Sumana Saman, who is charged by the ailing Buddha with looking after Vijaya and his descendants. When Prince Vijaya landed on Tambapanni (5th century BC) with his seven hundred followers, they saw a dog. Vijaya's men, surmising that 'Only where there is a village are dogs to be found', followed the creature, only to come upon the Queen of the Yakkhas, Kuveni. Though the protection of Suman Saman prevented Kuveni from devouring the hapless man, it did not prevent her from hurling him - and all of Vijaya's other companions - into a chasm. Vijaya eventually comes upon Kuveni and threatens her with death unless she releases his men. When this is done, Kuveni supplies them with food and clothing, and, 'assuming the lovely form of a sixteen year old maiden' seduces Vijaya. Then, in a complete reversal of her allegiances, she states that she 'will bestow Kingship on my Lord (Vijaya)' and thus 'all the Yakkhas must be slain, for (else) the Yakkhas will slay me, for it was through me that men have taken up their dwelling (in Lanka)'. This Vijaya goes on to do, vanquishing the Yakkhas and driving them from the island, all the time with Kuveni at his side. Though Kuveni bears him two children, a son and a daughter, Vijaya eventually rejects her with the words 'Go now, dear one, leaving the two children behind; men are ever in fear of superhuman beings'. Despite begging Vijaya not to send her away, a broken- hearted Kuveni eventually leaves the palace, taking the two children despite being ordered not to. Kuveni was killed by her relatives when she went back to them to ask for help, leaving the two children in the forest glades of Bambawa of the North West region in Sri Lanka. And when the mother did not return they trekked towards Sabaragamuwa. And alternative tale is that Kuveni flung herself from Yakdessa Gala, imploring the Gods to curse Vijaya for his cruelty - which they do by preventing any of Vijaya's children from ever sitting on the throne of Rajarata. 'Vijaya's curse' is held by some to still hold sway over Sri Lanka's troubled politics. Palace of Kuveni Ruins of the palace of Kuveni can be found inside Wilpattu National Park Sri Lanka.

It is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It is mostly used with rodents and is widely studied as an animal model of the human CNS demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). EAE is also the prototype for T-cell- mediated autoimmune disease in general. EAE was motivated by observations during the convalescence from viral diseases by Thomas M. Rivers, D. H. Sprunt and G. P. Berry in 1933. Their findings upon a transfer of inflamed patient tissue to primates was published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine. An acute monophasic illness, it has been suggested that EAE is far more similar to ADEM than MS. Types of EAE EAE can be induced in a number of species, including mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and primates. The most commonly used antigens in rodents are spinal cord homogenate (SCH), purified myelin, myelin protein such as MBP, PLP, and MOG, or peptides of these proteins, all resulting in distinct models with different disease characteristics regarding both immunology and pathology.MANNIE, M., R. H. SWANBORG and J. A. STEPANIAK, 2009,\\"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the rat.\\" Curr Protoc Immunol, Chapter 15: Unit 15 12MILLER, S. D., and W. J. KARPUS, 2007. \\"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the mouse.\\" Curr Protoc Immunol, Chapter 15: Unit 15 11 It may also be induced by the passive transfer of T cells specifically reactive to these myelin antigens. Depending on the antigen used and the genetic make-up of the animal, rodents can display a monophasic bout of EAE, a relapsing-remitting form, or chronic EAE. The typical susceptible rodent will debut with clinical symptoms around two weeks after immunization and present with a relapsing-remitting disease. The archetypical first clinical symptom is weakness of tail tonus that progresses to paralysis of the tail, followed by a progression up the body to affect the hind limbs and finally the forelimbs. However, similar to MS, the disease symptoms reflect the anatomical location of the inflammatory lesions, and may also include emotional lability, sensory loss, optic neuritis, difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia), and muscle weakness and spasms. Recovery from symptoms can be complete or partial and the time varies with symptoms and disease severity. Depending on the relapse-remission intervals, rats can have up to 3 bouts of disease within an experimental period. In mice Demyelination is produced by injection of brain extracts, CNS proteins (such as myelin basic protein), or peptides from such protein emulsified in an adjuvant such as complete Freund's adjuvant. The presence of the adjuvant allows the generation of inflammatory responses to the protein/peptides. In many protocols, mice are coinjected with pertussis toxin to break down the blood-brain barrier and allow immune cells access to the CNS tissue. This immunisation leads to multiple small disseminated lesions of demyelination (as well as micro-necroses) in the brain and spinal cord and the onset of clinical symptoms. Although sharing some features, mostly demyelination, this model, first introduced in 1930s, differs from human MS in several ways. EAE either kills animals or leaves them with permanent disabilities; animals with EAE also suffer severe nerve inflammation, and the time course of EAE is entirely different from MS, being the main antigen (MBP) in charge. Some key differences between EAE in mice, and MS in humans include: *B-cells: Some research points to anti-CD20 B-cells being the basis of the autoimmune attacks. This has been shown to be completely different in EAE and MS *oxidative injury: Mitochondrial injury is seen in EAE and MS, but mitochondrial gene deletions have so far only been detected in MS lesions.Hans Lassmann, Jack van Horssen, \\"Oxidative stress and its impact on neurons and glia in multiple sclerosis lesions\\", Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease, Volume 1862, Issue 3, March 2016, Pages 506-510, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2015.09.018 *microglia behaviour: In contrast to experimental models of inflammatory demyelination, lesion formation in multiple sclerosis occurs on a background of pro-inflammatory microglia activation, which is seen already in the normal white matter of age-matched controls, and this may contribute to neurodegeneration in the diseaseTobias Zrzavy Simon Hametner Isabella Wimmer Oleg Butovsky Howard L.

The reactions have been diverse according to the sources of the disease The researchers in the last report have termed the condition \\"Human autoimmune encephalitis\\" (HAE). The damage in the second report fulfilled all pathological diagnostic criteria of MS and can therefore be classified as MS in its own right. The lesions were classified as pattern II in the Lucchinetti system. This case of human EAE also showed Dawson fingers Using the confluent demyelination as barrier between MS and ADEM, some other reports about EAE in humans classify its effects as ADEM but not always. In Japanese patients exposed to rabies vaccine that contained neural tissue, the clinical presentation resembled ADEM more than MS but the lesions were like acute multiple sclerosis (Uchimura and Shiraki, 1957). =Anti-TNF demyelination= Recent problems with monoclonal antibodies point to an involvement of tumor necrosis factor alpha in the multiple sclerosis onset.

Also a model for pattern III lesions has been developed in which mitochondrial metabolism is impaired, resulting in a tissue energy deficiency, a mechanism later termed ‚Äúvirtual hypoxia‚Äù. The demyelination, characterized by loss of myelin-associated glycoprotein, has been described as ‚Äúhypoxia-like‚Äù.

He devoted essentially his whole working life to the four colour theorem and in 1890 he exposed a flaw in Alfred Kempe's proof, that had been considered as valid for 11 years. With the four colour theorem being open again he established the five colour theorem instead. The four colour theorem itself was finally established by a computer-based proof in 1976. Writing in the Journal of the London Mathematical Society, G A Dirac, wrote: He was fond of country pursuits, and one of his interests was Hebrew. His nickname was \\"Pussy\\".
