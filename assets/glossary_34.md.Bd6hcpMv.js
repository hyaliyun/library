He served in the Second Boer War (in the British Cape Colony armed forces), in World War I and in World War II, and was awarded the Silver medal of the Royal Aero Club posthumously for his \\"Services to aviation over 50 years\\". Early life Arthur Edward George was born in Fordington, near Dorchester, Dorset, England on 17 June 1875; his family moved to Newcastle upon Tyne while he was a child. He was a talented athlete, being a swimmer, figure skater and racing cyclist at international level.Encyclopaedic site about A.E.George and George & Joblin After serving an engineering apprenticeship in Newcastle, he lived for some time in South Africa, where he became national cycling champion and represented South Africa at the 1899 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Montreal, Canada. He served with the Cape Colony Cyclist Corps from 7 January 1901 until 12 May 1902 in the Second Boer War, receiving the Queen's South Africa Medal with three clasps.National Archive information about A.E.GeorgeMedals awarded to Sergeant A.E.George in 1901 and 1902 On his attestation (joining-up) form he is described as being \\"Age: 23(?), Nationality: English, Trade: Cycle Mechanic, Height: 5 ft 10¬Ωin, Weight: 150 lbs, Chest: 38in, Complexion: Fair, Eyes: Blue, Hair: Black, Character: Very good.\\" It was noted that he \\"Supplies own bicycle\\".National Archives Ref WO 126/20 for the Boer War service records Later life In 1902, having returned to England, he formed the company George and Jobling in Newcastle upon Tyne with Robert (\\"Bob\\") Lee Jobling. In 1904 the company moved to premises which had previously been used by Robert Stephenson and Company, which it was to occupy for 60 years. George and Jobling first manufactured bicycles and later motor vehicles and automobile bodywork. It also sold motor vehicles and was an agent for many manufacturers. In addition to its coachbuilding business, George & Jobling sold motor vehicles and was an agent for many manufacturers, including Argyll, Darracq, Hillman, Ford and Fordson. Between 1907 and 1970, the firm had branches in Hexham, Glasgow, Darlington, Bowness and Leeds and is credited with inventing the forerunner of the trolley-jack and the breakdown-truck. It became well known as 'expert witnesses' in court cases involving serious motoring accidents. George was a keen racing driver and competed at home and in mainland Europe in road races, hill climbs and sand racing. He achieved third place driving a Darracq in the 1908 RAC Tourist Trophy race, during which he also set the fastest lap time, and won many races in a stripped-down Ford Model T at Brooklands and Saltburn. This same car was later fitted with a polished brass body and became known as the 'Golden Ford', which is still preserved. During the National Strike of 1926, he was involved in driving newspapers from Newcastle to London.\\" In August 1909 George became an active memberA.E.George donated 4 guineas toward the purchase of the club's clubhouse Flight Magazine 11 September 1909 of the Royal Aero Club of the United KingdomFlight Magazine 14 August 1909 and learned to fly on a Voisin biplane called Bird of Passage which he had bought from J.T.C. Moore-Brabazon,Turner, p.14. holder of Aviator's Certificate no. 1; he later sold the Bird of Passage to Cecil Grace. He designed and built his own aeroplane, which featured hollow spars, a steerable tail-wheel and unique 'triplicate control column which controlled not only roll and pitch but also yaw. The control column has been preserved and is on display at the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne. On 6 September 1910 he gained Aviator's Certificate no. 19 flying this prototype aircraft.Flight Magazine 10 September 1910 Front and side elevation views of his aircraft, which was displayed at the Olympia Exhibition in 1910, can be found in the Flight Magazine archive.Front and side views of the George & Jobling biplane at Flight Magazine 2 April 1910 Later the same year he crashed it at an Air display in Newcastle; his application to the banks for more funds to continue designing and building aircraft was refused on the grounds that it was too dangerous; after this setback, he concentrated his efforts on customising and selling cars. He nevertheless took an active interest in flying throughout his life: he was a leading member of the Newcastle upon Tyne Aero Club; he obtained his Civil Aviation Class A Pilot's Licence in 1935 and his Class A glider pilot's licence in 1937; in World War II he served from July 1939 until November 1940 as Commanding Officer of 131 Tyneside Squadron, Air Defence Cadet Corps. A.E.George volunteered for military service in World War I, rising to the rank of (temporary) Major in the Northumberland Motor Volunteer Corps. Between the wars he pursued his business, sporting and flying interests, serving again in World War II as Commanding Officer of the local Air Defence Cadet Corps between 1939 and 1940, followed by volunteer service in both the Home Guard and the Royal Navy. On 8 September 1951 George died of cancer in Bingley, Yorkshire, aged 76. His funeral was held in Newcastle and was attended by local dignitaries, representatives of the aviation world and previous employees. The local RAF Air Cadets performed a fly-past over the funeral ceremony. In honour of his services to aviation, the Royal Aero Club awarded him a posthumous Silver Medal.

The sketch features a television presenter (Graham Chapman) interviewing paleontologist Anne Elk (John Cleese in drag). The plot of the sketch is that Miss Elk (who is very concerned about being properly credited: \\"A. Elk, brackets, Miss, brackets\\") has severe difficulty presenting her new theory about brontosauruses due to her bizarre mannerisms, which include circumlocution, repetition, and obnoxious, noisy throat-clearing. When she is finally able to state her theory, it turns out to be a very trite observation that \\"All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much, much thicker in the middle, and then thin again at the far end.\\" In the original broadcast version, the sketch is taken over by other jokes from within the same episode, and spills over into the set of a previous sketch where Miss Elk concludes the episode with a second theory about Marcel Proust. This sketch was also performed on the album Monty Python's Previous Record, under the title 'Miss Anne Elk'. On this version, before beginning her second theory, the interviewer shoots her. At Cleese's request, the sketch was performed as part of the team's 2014 live reunion show, Monty Python Live (Mostly), with Eric Idle playing the interviewer. This version concluded with an extended coughing fit, before linking to the \\"Dancing Teeth\\" animation. Anne Elk's roundabout speech pattern was based on Graham Chapman's partner David Sherlock, who evidently spoke in such a manner, amusing the other Pythons. The sketch inspired the concept of \\"Elk Theories\\" to describe scientific observations that are not theories but merely minimal accounts. The character A. Elk and her \\"Theory of Brontosauruses\\" is used in the American Psychological Association Style Guide to illustrate how to reference a periodical article in a learned journal.

Celebrated by critics and collectors alike, Waichulis' works have been published in many major art publications including The Artist's Magazine, Fine Art Connoisseur, American Artist, American Art Review, American Art Collector, Art News, and Art-Talk. Anthony, represented by Gallery 1261 in Denver, has exhibited in numerous key venues across the country including the Smithsonian Institution, National Arts Club, Butler Institute of American Art, Orlando Museum of Art, Arnot Art Museum, and the Beijing World Art Museum among others. Waichulis has also achieved top honors in prestigious national and international competition held today including The Artist's Magazine's Annual Competition and the Art Renewal Center's International Salon Competition. In January 2006, Anthony became the first Trompe L'Oeil painter to be granted Living Master status with The Art Renewal Center. Early life Waichulis‚Äô love of art started at a young age, when his grandmother would give him and his siblings pencils and paper to keep them occupied in her home. He began drawing for hours on end whenever he visited his grandmother. Waichulis admitted that when he decided to go to college for art, people he had known throughout his life were baffled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a geeky kid from Northeastern Pennsylvania. When I told people I was going to go to school for art, they looked at me like I was going to build a nuclear missile in my backyard.‚Äù Anthony‚Äôs parents stood behind him when he decided to attend college to pursue his love for art. Education Waichulis‚Äô formal art education began in 1986 at the Art Hatchery in Bear Creek, Pennsylvania. He studied there until he enrolled in Luzerne County Community College, which he attended from 1992 to 1994. Continuing his education, Waichulis began attending the Schuler School of Fine Arts in Baltimore, Maryland in 1995, graduating two years later. Career In 1998, Waichulis opened The Waichulis Studio (TWS). His unique system of training would produce artists responsible for some of the most breathtaking realism of today. The TWS atelier would quickly become one of the most respected apprenticeship studios in the United States. In 2010, Anthony‚Äôs highly successful Waichulis Studio caught the attention of a newly forming entity with aspirations for an educational effort on a global scale. Waichulis‚Äô current undertaking, the Ani Art Academies, was the brainchild of Tim Reynolds, co-founder of a Wall Street trading firm, artist, patron of the arts, and founder of the Tim Reynolds Foundation. Reynolds‚Äô vision was to create a non-profit effort that would provide an intensive multi-year art skills education to aspiring artists around the world. In 2011, the Waichulis Studio merged with the Ani Art Academies project to form the Ani Art Academy Waichulis. In order to provide individual attention for each pupil, only eleven applicants are accepted each year. Since it began, the Ani Art Academies project has seen the launch of two international Academies: one in Anguilla and one in the Dominican Republic. Additional academies using Waichulis's celebrated curriculum are scheduled to open in Thailand, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka in the near future. In 2010 Waichulis contributed a piece entitled Young Leia to the book Star Wars Art: Visions. He also worked as an art professor at his alma mater. In 2014, his works were featured in two exhibitions: Still Life, Floral and Trompe L'Oeil at the John Pence Gallery in San Francisco, CA and Heroes, Villains, Myths and Legends at the Rehs Galleries in New York City. Since his first exhibition there in 1999, Waichulis has presented his works many times at the John Pence Gallery. In addition to his presence in major galleries and publications, Waichulis also appeared on Art Scene with Erika Funke, a local television program, in 2009 and 2011. Waichulis makes very few new pieces available each year for others to purchase, and the prices of these pieces range from $4,850 to $45,000. Personal life Anthony lives with his wife, Leah Waichulis, in Bear Creek, Pennsylvania. His wife was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and also studied art at Luzerne County Community College.

Mission The mission of OBRA is to promote and develop the sport of bicycle racing in Oregon by providing the tools and resources necessary for competition.  History  = Foundation = Alpenrose Velodrome The Oregon Bicycle Racing Association (OBRA) was started in the late 1970s. Called the Oregon Cycling Association (OCA), it was then the district association of USCF clubs. The name was changed to the Oregon Bicycle Racing Association several years later to avoid confusion with the political group, the Oregon Citizens Alliance which was getting much negative media attention. There was not much activity for the first few years after OCA was formed. When Steve Scarich became the District Representative he pushed to increase the strength of the organization. Organization was improved and a system of collecting fees from races was established. A few years later Mike Murray was elected to the board. Murray wanted more racing in Oregon so he turned the focus of the group toward making it easier to produce quality events. He bought traffic signs, photo finish equipment, PA systems, CB radios and more. = Separation from USCF = Dissatisfaction with the United States Cycling Federation came on slowly and climaxed in December 1998 when the USCF fired all Regional Representatives in favor of a plan to utilize 10 people nationwide to service the membership. At this same time alternatives to the insurance provided by the national governing body became more readily available and the question was asked, 'What is OBRA getting back for the dollars that are sent to Colorado Springs?' An annual membership ranged from $35 to $50 and then the charge for insurance was about twice what was available commercially. OBRA leadership figured that Oregon alone was sending about $200,000 annually to USAC in USCF and NORBA membership fees and race permits and surcharges. In exchange OBRA received little in the way of services and soon their local representation would be eliminated. When USA Cycling doubled the permit fees for weekend day series races, OBRA leadership sent a message to Colorado Springs that Oregon series promoters would choose to insure with an insurance plan purchased by OBRA and to forgo USCF sanctioning. Letters were sent to every USAC board director and staff member explaining why OBRA were doing this and further explaining that it was likely that all Oregon events would do this unless USAC made changes to address concerns over the diminishing level of service. Only one response from USAC was received. In the fall of 1998 there was a vote of member clubs that was unanimous that the OBRA insurance plan would be offered at all events. = Success = OBRA membership has swelled to the highest levels ever when David Beede contacted OBRA about branching out into mountain bike racing. The dissatisfaction among NORBA members was even greater than that from the road/track side. Last year they were able to organize a race series amongst the mountain bike races and added them to OBRAs email network. This has given them a voice that they have not experienced before. Now other states have followed their lead. American Bicycle Racing (ABR) in the Midwest, Bicycle Racing Association of Colorado (BRAC - which has now changed its name to American Cycling Association) represent Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and parts of Texas and North California/Nevada Cycling Association (NCNCA) have all formed a coalition of association- Federation of Independent Cycling Associations (FIAC). OBRA has started incorporation proceedings and are working toward a shared rulebook and rider reciprocity. The OBRA 2000 calendar has over 200 days of racing, offering discounted membership to juniors and strongly suggest that the race organizers reduce entry fees for those under 18. The Best All round Competition has expanded to recognize the outstanding performances in each discipline and new for 2000 OBRA are hosting an Oregon Cup.Murray, Candi: \\"Re: OBRA's History\\", originally written 2000, OBRA list- serv, March 1, 2007 = Statistics = According to OBRA statistics, membership has grown dramatically since 2000.Murray, Candi, \\"2006 end of year statistics.xls\\" *2000- 1738 members *2001- 1741 members *2002- 1978 members *2003- 2335 members *2004- 2760 members *2005- 2828 members *2006- 3296 members, 1014 1-day memberships According to Velonews (2006)Murray, Candi: \\"Some statistics from Velo news\\", OBRA list-serv, September 9, 2006. * Oregon was ranked #2 in the number of cycling events, only 8 races behind California. * Oregon was ranked #3 in the number of amateur racers, behind only California and Colorado. * Oregon was ranked #1 in terms of the percentage of riders vs. state population with Colorado coming in over 50% lower in 2nd place. = Notable current and former members = *Chris Horner of Team Radio Shack *Aaron Olson of Colavita *Ryan Trebon of Kona/Les Gets *Ian Boswell of Sky *Jacob Rathe of Jelly-Belly-Kenda *Clara Honsinger of Team S&M; CX - 2019 Cyclocross Elite Women USA National Champ  Organization  = Governance = The Oregon Bicycle Racing Association is an Oregon Non Profit Corporation that has its Constitution and Bylaws on file with the State of Oregon. The business and affairs of OBRA are managed by its Board of Directors. There are six members of the Board of Directors.

Major projects such as the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, founded in 1972,e.g. http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/history.php for the history of this project and the text collections of the Packard Humanities Institute set the trend, and there are still a significantly large number of ancient world projects among Humanities Computing projects today.See, e.g., the projects listed at http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cch/research/projects.html or http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/iathrails/projects/homepage Also, the success of traditional scholarly publications in digital guises, such as seen in the Bryn Mawr Classical Review,See http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/about.html for information on the history and scope of this publication and the early adoption of hypertext in high profile projects like the Perseus Digital LibraryThe Perseus Project was originally published on the HyperCard platform in 1990 ‚Äî around the time of the invention of the World Wide Web; see archival versions of the Perseus 1.0 documentation, http://vanth.perseus.tufts.edu/Help/P1/Doc1.info.html and the Platform- Independent Perseus documentation, http://vanth.perseus.tufts.edu/Help/PIP2/Goals_Help.html, Mylonas, \\"The Perseus Project,\\" http://xml.coverpages.org/mylonasPerseus.html, and Mylonas, Crane, Morrell, and Smith, \\"The Perseus Project: Data in the Electronic Age\\" in Solomon, Accessing Antiquity op. cit. for information toward a history of Perseus' use of hypertext platforms and other information infrastructures. helped to legitimize computing in the study of classics in ways that has not always been the case in other areas of the humanities. This apparent paradox may be as a result of the many methodologies and different sources of evidence that classicists have always had to embrace, from literary sources and linguistics, to art history and archaeology, history, philosophy, religious theory, ancient documents such as inscriptions and papyri, and so forth. The fragmentary nature of many of the texts and languages of the ancient world, the scattered evidence from the material culture of ancient Greece and Rome, and the necessity to evaluate all these varieties of evidence in context are particularly likely to benefit from digital approaches such as databases, text markup, and image manipulation. Digital classics projects There are currently several major projects that aim to encourage and develop digital approaches to classical scholarship. The Stoa Consortium at the University of Kentucky distributes news of the discipline, and serves as a peer-reviewed electronic publication venue, and encourages open source approaches to digital classics. The Perseus Project is a digital library that also provides a collection of digital texts and analysis tools to the public; principally (but not exclusively) classical. Digital Classicist at King's College London is another project and community which shares information and advice about the digital humanities applied to the field of classics.See http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Main_Page The Liverpool Classics Mailing List is a project which can be subscribed to in which one receives email regarding Classics events around the world, as well as call for papers, studentships and public lectures.See http://www.lsoft.com/scripts/wl.exe?SL1=CLASSICISTS&H;=LISTSERV.LIV.AC.UK for details See also * Digital Medievalist * The Alpheios Project * Novae Res Antiqui References External links * Thesaurus Linguae Graecae * The Stoa Consortium * Digital Classics Association * The Digital Classicist project * Perseus Project * Open Greek and Latin Project * The Tesserae Project * The Alpheios Project * Novae Res Antiqui Category:Digital media Category:Digital humanities Category:Computing in classical studies ","title":"Digital classics"},{"id":"9820538","title":"List of The Girls Next Door episodes"},{"id":"9820552","text":"Dame Miraka \\"Mira\\" Sz√°szy (n√©e Petricevich, 7 August 1921 ‚Äì 20 December 2001) was a prominent MƒÅori leader, making significant contributions in education, broadcasting, social welfare and small business development. Biography Mira Petricevich was the first MƒÅori woman to graduate with a degree from the University of Auckland - BA, Dip SocSci. She was then the first MƒÅori woman to win a fellowship to the University of Hawaii. After returning to New Zealand, she joined the Ministry of Maori Affairs as a welfare officer. In 1951, she was involved in the establishment of the MƒÅori Women's Welfare League (Te Ropu Wahine Maori Toko i te Ora) and was appointed secretary of its first executive. Between 1973 and 1977, Sz√°szy was president of the organisation. In the early 1960s, she represented the League on the board of the MƒÅori Education Foundation. Alongside campaigning for MƒÅori, Sz√°szy championed the cause of women, recalling how she became aware of 'the oppression of women as well as of MƒÅori when she began working in a government department, and having observed \\"job discrimination\\" within the department.' Like Dame Whina Cooper, Sz√°szy felt keenly the injustice that resulted from some iwi preventing women from speaking upon the marae ƒÅtea, despite possessing an eloquence \\"as good as, if not better than that of the men I listened to.\\" Her dedication to achieving equality for MƒÅori women was acknowledged in tributes after her death. The then-Prime Minister, Helen Clark said, \\"In addition to her role as an advocate and worker for MƒÅoridom, she was a tireless champion on behalf of women, and, in particular, to advance the status of MƒÅori women.\\" She began her career as a teacher in 1946, and in 1972, became a lecturer in MƒÅori Studies at Auckland Secondary Teachers' Training College (now Auckland College of Education). In the 1978 New Year Honours, Sz√°szy was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the community and MƒÅori people. She was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1990 New Year Honours, for services to the community. In 1993, she received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Victoria University of Wellington in recognition of her contribution to the nation. Also in 1993, she was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. Personal life Sz√°szy was born in Waihopo, Northland, in 1921, of NgƒÅti Kurƒ´, Te Rarawa, and Te Aup≈çuri descent. Her parents were Lovro Petricevich, a Dalmatian gum digger, and Makareta Raharuhi. She married Albert Sz√°szy, an Aucklander of Hungarian heritage in 1956; they had two sons, Philip and Mark. Death Sz√°szy died at home in Ngataki, aged 80, in 2001. Legacy The Mira Sz√°szy Research Centre was established by the University of Auckland Business School in 1998 in honour of Sz√°szy's achievements; the centre is New Zealand's first dedicated MƒÅori and Pacific research facility in business and economics.

Typically, the impending loss is the death of someone close due to illness. This can be experienced by dying individuals themselves and can also be felt due to non-death-related losses like a scheduled mastectomy, pending divorce, company downsizing or war. This 1860 woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld depicts David's anticipatory grief. First he was warned that his child would die. Then, \\"The Lord struck the child that Uriah‚Äôs wife bore to David, and it became very ill. David therefore pleaded with God for the child; David fasted, and went in and lay all night on the ground. The elders of his house stood beside him, urging him to rise from the ground; but he would not, nor did he eat food with them.\\"()  Stages  The five stages model of grief ‚Äì denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, as proposed by Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross ‚Äì describes the process people undergo after a loss. Anxiety, dread, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, and feelings of being overwhelmed are also common. However, it is important to note that anticipatory grief is not simply normal grief begun earlier.  Identifying features  Features identified specifically with anticipatory grief include heightened concern for the dying person, rehearsal of the death and attempts to adjust to the consequences of the death. The period can allow people to resolve issues with the dying person and to say goodbye. It may provide some sense of orientation and access to the grieving process. For some, it prompts conscious closure before the end/loss. Grief happening prior to a loss presents a compounding issue of isolation because of a lack of social acceptance. Anticipatory grief doesn't usually take the place of post-loss grief: there is not a fixed amount of grief to be experienced, so grief experienced before the loss does not necessarily reduce grief after the death. However, there may be little grieving after the loss due to anticipatory grief. How often anticipatory grief occurs is a subject of some controversy. For example, a study of widows found that they stayed with their husbands until the death and could only mourn once the death had occurred. Researchers suggest that to start to grieve as though the loss has already happened can leave the bereaved feeling guilt for partially abandoning the patient. Many family members can find themselves in a caregiving role during their loved one's process of death. During the progression of the illness, the security and protectiveness of the caregiver also increases. Bouchal, Rallison and Sinclair discuss that, \\"the strong need to offer protection was part of the anticipatory mourning experience of striving to be with in the present\\".Raffin Bouchal, S., Rallison, L., Moules, N., Sinclair, S. (2015). Holding On and Letting Go: Families' Experiences of Anticipatory Mourning in Terminal Cancer. OMEGA ‚Äì Journal of Death and Dying. 72(1), 42-68. DOI: 10.1177/0030222815574700 In the process of anticipatory grief, family members also begin to prepare and reflect on how their lives will be once their loved one passes. There are many ways in which to perform reflection. These ways include: \\"...reading, journaling, thinking, and reflecting about how life might be like without their partner.\\" The journal also expands on the premise that the preparation process is not an individual process. Those who are affected by the impending death often look towards one another for support as well as others who are involved in care such as nurses and social workers. A direct correlation exists between anticipatory grieving and the caregiver's quality of life. In a quantitative study conducted by Al-Gamal and Long, the effect of a pediatric cancer diagnosis on parents had a negative impact on the majority of study participants. More specifically, parents reported experiencing increasing stress and a decrease in physical and mental health ‚Äì all of which affect the process of anticipatory grief.Al-Gamal, E., Long, T. (2010). Anticipatory grieving among parents living with a child with cancer. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 66(9), 1980-1990. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05381.x Ultimately, anticipatory grieving is an extremely dynamic process that differs between individuals. The outcomes of the grieving process depend on the preparation of death and the anticipatory grief process.

It is a Grade I listed building. History A market hall has stood on the site since the 1260s. The structure immediately prior to the current structure was erected in 1567. The current building, which is thought to have been designed by Walter Hancock in the Classical Renaissance style, was completed in 1597. The Royal Coat of Arms of Queen Elizabeth I, with the date of 1596, and the English lion and the Welsh dragon as supporters, were carved into the stone above the main arch. In the 17th century the large upper room was originally used by the Shrewsbury Drapers Company to sell Welsh cloth and the lower floor was used by farmers to sell their corn. High up above the main arch there is a statue of a man in armour; it is thought to be Richard, Duke of York (died 1460) and is believed to be the only statue of him in the country. This sculpture was originally located on the Welsh Bridge and it was moved to its current location on the orders of the town mayor in 1771. The lower part of the structure has been used for many purposes, including as an air raid shelter during the Second World War while the top room of the old Market Hall was used as the town's magistrates court until 1995. The building underwent a major restoration, to the designs of Arrol & Snell, to convert it into an arts venue and caf√©, showcasing films and digital media. The restoration was completed at a cost of ¬£1.7 million and the building re-opened in 2004.

He was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the first round (sixth overall pick) of the 1980 NFL Draft. A 6'4\\", 256 lbs., Greer played seven seasons, principally as a defensive end, in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cardinals between 1980 and 1987. He was a top pass rusher in the early 1980s before his career was curtailed by knee problems, missing an entire year in 1986.  Early years  Greer was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1957. He played high school football at Detroit's Cass Technical High School, graduating in 1975.  University of Michigan  Greer enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1975 and played college football as a defensive tackle for Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1976 to 1979. He had been planning to attend Michigan State University, but decided to follow several of his high school teammates to the University of Michigan. He played defensive tackle at Michigan. Greer was a 1979 All-America selection. He had 11 sacks his sophomore and junior year. He set a Michigan record for tackles-for-a-loss in a season (21) and career (48). He was a two-time First- team All-Big Ten Conference selection (1978, 1979) and helped lead the Wolverines to three conference championships and four bowl games.  NFL career  Greer was the first pick from the Cardinals in the 1980 NFL Draft. He missed a few games in his rookie season after suffering a concussion and ended the season in injured reserve after breaking his thumb in a loss against the Philadelphia Eagles. He recorded 30 sacks in 1983‚Äì84 and 37.5 in a 41-game stretch of the strike-shortened 1982 season and from 1983 to 1985, whose total was the second best in the National Football League for that period, behind Dexter Manley of the Washington Redskins. In 1983, he had 16 sacks, second in the National Football Conference, behind future Pro Football Hall of Famer Fred Dean. He had 4.5 sacks in the final game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles. In 1984 Greer was named a second-team All-NFC selection by UPI and finished third in the league with 14 sacks while starting in 52 consecutive games. He played the final five games of the 1985 season with swelling in his right knee, and led his team in sacks the first six years in the league. He underwent knee surgery prior to the start of the 1986 season and was expected to miss the first six weeks of the season. However, the extent of the injuries to his knee proved to be significant and he missed the entire 1986 season. He developed early signs of rheumatoid arthritis in his good knee, ligament damage in his other knee and fluid in his ankle. He was expected to retire by the Cardinals staff prior to the start of the 1987 season, but he decided to return for a final year, despite doctors warnings about his knee. He was among the players who crossed the picket line during the 1987 NFL strike. That year, he played in 10 games, starting nine of them and recorded six sacks. He retired at season's end.

Medizinische Klinik, March 28, 1915b, 11 (13): 359-360. is a neurological examination finding elicited by a reflex test which can help verify the presence or absence of issues arising from the corticospinal tract. It is named after neurologist Johann Hoffmann.Both / Usually considered a pathological reflex in a clinical setting, the Hoffmann's reflex has also been used as a measure of spinal reflex processing (adaptation) in response to exercise training. Procedure The Hoffmann's reflex test itself involves loosely holding the middle finger and flicking the fingernail downward, allowing the middle finger to flick upward reflexively. A positive response is seen when there is flexion and adduction of the thumb on the same hand. Hoffman reflex - A complete guide - MedicosNotes.com = Interpretations = A positive Hoffmann‚Äôs reflex and finger jerks suggest hypertonia, but can occur in healthy individuals, and are not useful signs in isolation. In cerebellar diseases, the reflexes may be pendular, and muscle contraction and relaxation tend to be slow, but these are not sensitive or specific to cerebellar signs. Comparisons to Babinski sign Hoffmann's sign is often considered the upper limb equivalent of the Babinski sign test. Hoffmann's reflex is often erroneously confused with Babinski's. However the two reflexes are quite different, and should not be equated with each other. A positive Babinski sign is considered a pathological sign of upper motor neuron disease except for infants, in whom it is normal,New York University School of Medicine. Deep Tendon Reflexes. URL: http://endeavor.med.nyu.edu/neurosurgery/reflexes.html. Accessed November 27, 2005. whereas a positive Hoffmann's sign can be present in an entirely normal patient. A positive Hoffmann's sign in the normal patients is more commonly found in those who are naturally hyper-reflexive (e.g. 3+ reflexes). A positive Hoffmann's sign is a worrisome finding of a disease process if its presence is asymmetrical, or has an acute onset. Another significant difference between Hoffmann's reflex and the Babinski sign is their mechanism of reflex. Hoffmann's reflex is a deep tendon reflex (spindle fibre) with a monosynaptic reflex pathway in Rexed lamina IX of the spinal cord, normally fully inhibited by descending input. On the other hand, the plantar reflex is more complicated and not a deep tendon reflex, and its pathway is both more complicated and not fully understood. Different sorts of lesions may interrupt them. This fact has led some neurologists to reject strongly any analogies between the finger flexor reflex and the plantar response. When both lower and upper neuron damage is indicated, it leads a physician to indicate a motor neuron illness, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Hughes It followed the death of Spencer Leigh Hughes and resignation of George Wardle, the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Stockport. With the departure of both MPs, a single by-election was held for both seats. Always a rare occurrence in Britain, Stockport was the first such by-election since the 1899 Oldham by- election; it proved to be the last such by-election, as multi-member constituencies were abolished in 1950. Background At the 1918 general election, the Lloyd George Coalition Government had won a large majority. The coalition included most of the Conservative and Liberal parties. Both Stockport MPs had been Coalition candidates, Hughes being a Liberal, but Wardle unusually being a Labour Party supporter of the Coalition. With this unusual level of cross-party agreement, they had not faced any opposition. By 1920, the prospect of a merger of the Conservative and Liberal parties was being seriously considered. The local Conservative group considered that had it run candidates in 1918, it would have won both seats. As a result, when Hughes died, they considered it their turn to nominate a candidate for the constituency. Meanwhile, the Liberal group was determined to run a candidate to replace Hughes. David Lloyd George and Bonar Law, national Liberal and Conservative leaders, had been considering merging their organisations to form a single party, and considered that it would be a disaster to have Conservative and Liberal candidates facing each other. In order to keep their local organisations happy, they convinced Wardle to resign, enabling both to stand a candidate. The Liberals chose Henry Fildes, and the Conservatives, William Greenwood. The majority of the Labour Party were opposed to the Coalition, and determined to stand candidates outside it in an attempt to gain Wardle's seat. After some discussion, they decided to stand economist and former Liberal MP Leo Chiozza Money and to support the candidature of the national organiser of the Co-operative Party, Samuel Perry. Horatio Bottomley, a prominent right-wing independent politician also assembled a slate of two candidates on an \\"Anti-Waste\\" platform, foreshadowing the Anti-Waste League he formed the following year. The Irish War of Independence had begun in 1919. While the Labour Party had a policy in favour of Irish self-determination, many Irish people considered that it had done little to act on it. A leading Irish trade unionist and secretary of the Irish Labour Party, William X. O'Brien, was interned by Britain for his role in the conflict, and he decided to stand in the by-election as a platform for his cause, and in an attempt to embarrass the British Labour Party into action. On the ballot, he insisted that he was described as the \\"Irish Republican Workers Party\\" candidate, even though no such organisation existed. In Parliament, Joseph Kenworthy called for O'Brien's release to contest the by-election, a call supported by Labour candidate Money, citing the example of John Maclean. Home Secretary Edward Shortt rejected this option. With a total of seven candidates, the Stockport by-election set a new record, not equalled until the 1962 South Dorset by- election and not beaten until the 1976 Walsall North by-election. Results Greenwood and Fildes achieved a clear victory, their similar tally of votes suggesting that most coalition supporters had indeed voted for both candidates. Money's profile enabled him to take third place, some six thousand votes behind, with Perry further back. The difference in their votes was around 1,500, much of this being explained by the 1,000 voters who had supported Money and O'Brien ‚Äì very few opting for O'Brien and any other candidate. The Anti-Waste candidates attracted little support, but both were able to beat O'Brien. Labour were disappointed not to take a seat, particularly as O'Brien's intervention had not taken enough votes to explain their defeat. Perhaps in part as a result of the by-election, they moved their position to more actively support the Irish labour movement. Greenwood and Fildes both held their seats at the 1922 general election, while O'Brien was elected as TD for Dublin South the same year. Perry was eventually elected as MP for Kettering at the 1923 general election.

His brother was the violinist and conductor Eug√®ne Ysa√øe. Biography Rather overshadowed throughout his life by the career of his elder brother Eug√®ne, Th√©o Ysa√øe began amateur studies in music at the Li√®ge Conservatory and, on Eug√®ne's advice, furthered his education in Berlin. In 1885, Ysa√øe returned to Paris, where he joined the Bande √† Franck but also supported the growth of a new aesthetic movement represented by the impressionism of Claude Debussy. Ysa√øe helped promote the work of the new school of French musicians, in Brussels. In 1894, he and his brother found engagements with the La Libre Esth√©tique in Brussels, which offered the residents of the city the opportunity to experience a generous range of displays in both music and the plastic arts. Ysa√øe contributed his talents as a pianist and a r√©p√©titeur. Although Ysa√øe was an excellent pianist, his fragile health did not allow him to follow the hectic pace of his brother's career and he instead became a professor at the Gen√®ve Conservatory of Music. In 1918, Th√©o Ysa√øe died in Nice, France, two days before Debussy. His relatively vast oeuvre has not been published in its entirety, let alone performed as such. His opus 13, 14 and 15 were published by G. Schirmer in New York. He wrote symphonies, piano concertos, symphonic poems, and chamber music, principally, as well as a requiem.

Modern coast lines are shown. According to mythology, Misenum was named after Misenus, a companion of Hector and trumpeter to Aeneas. Misenus is supposed to have drowned near here after a trumpet competition with the sea-god Triton, as recounted in Virgil's Aeneid. In 39 BC, Misenum was the site where a short- lived pact was made between Octavian (heir of Julius Caesar, who later became the emperor Augustus), and his rival Sextus Pompeius. Misenum was first established as a naval base (Portus Julius) during the civil wars in 27 BC by Marcus Agrippa, the right-hand man of the emperor Augustus. It was then developed into the largest Roman port for the Classis Misenensis, the most important fleet. With its gorgeous natural setting close to the naval base and the nearby important Roman cities of Puteoli and Neapolis, Misenum also became the site of Roman luxury villas, such as the Villa of Lucullus.Tacitus Annals 6.50 View of modern Capo Miseno, on the site of ancient Misenum.

He was primarily a right-handed batsman, and he held the record for the most runs scored in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic first-class cricket competition for a number of years before Amol Muzumdar took the record in 2009. However, despite his success, he was never selected for the Indian national team, an unfortunate feat he shares with the man who broke his record. Kaypee began his first-class career with Punjab in the 1980-81 season making his debut against Jammu and Kashmir. Having played a few reasonably good seasons for Punjab, he moved to Haryana in 1986-87. It was here where Kaypee played for the rest of his career and where he found much success. Kaypee's most successful season was in 1990-91 when he scored 940 runs in the Ranji Trophy, helping Haryana to their first and, to date, only Ranji Trophy title. He was the top run-scorer in the competition that year, and he was named as an Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year. The following season, he had another prolific Ranji Trophy, scoring 812 runs. He continued to perform consistently well for Haryana for many seasons, and even captained the team in 31 matches. However, he was only twice selected in the North Zone team for the Duleep Trophy, playing two matches each in the 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons. As a result, he tended to be overlooked by the national team selectors, and so never made an appearance for the national side. In October 2000, Kaypee retired from cricket. He finished his career with a record aggregate of 7623 runs in the Ranji Trophy including 27 centuries. Post retirement kaypee was appointed as the head coach of the Haryana team for the 2008-09 season. Kaypee was also a match referee for the BCCI for a number of seasons. In April 2006 Kaypee was part of the Indian veterans team that visited Pakistan to play a limited-overs 4 match series against a Pakistan Veteran's XI, organised by the Pakistan Seniors Cricket Board. The Indian side was led by former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin. In the 1990s Kaypee had a spell with Smethwick and streetly Cricket Club, as their overseas player.

Neurokinin B is implicated in a variety of human functions and pathways such as the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Additionally, NKB is associated with pregnancy in females and maturation in young adults. Reproductive function is highly dependent on levels of both neurokinin B and also the G-protein coupled receptor ligand kisspeptin. The first NKB studies done attempted to resolve why high levels of the peptide may be implicated in pre- eclampsia during pregnancy. NKB, kisspeptin, and dynorphin together are found in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) known as the KNDy subpopulation. This subpopulation is targeted by many steroid hormones and works to form a network that feeds back to GnRH pulse generator. Synthesis Neurokinin B is found in humans as a ten-peptide chain (decapeptide) attached to a terminal amide group. The peptide formula is H-Asp-Met-His-Asp-Phe-Phe-Val-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2. Neurokinin b (NKB), is encoded by the TAC3 gene in humans and Tac2 in rodent species. Neurokinin b is expressed along with the peptides kisspeptin and dynorphin A in the neuronal cells of the arcuate nucleus. Five exon segments in the TAC3 gene encode for the NKB precursor known as preprotachykinin B. Preprotachykinin B is then proteolytically cleaved into the pro-peptide proneurokinin B. A second proteolytic cleavage of proneurokinin B produces the final product neurokinin B. Role in humans During the ovarian cycle, GnRH secretion along with that of luteinizing hormone (LH) is highly regulated. This regulation occurs by a negative feedback system. Neurokinin B along with its sister peptides of the KNDy subpopulation regulate this feedback. The NK3R receptor group when activated with a synthetic agonist of NKB, senktide, has been shown to stimulate the secretion of luteinizing hormone. In addition, studies have shown that NKB plays a larger role in females than in males. It has been found that in brain of females, the arcuate nucleus contains twice as many connections to NKB neurons than males. Arcuate Nucleus Shown as AR Receptors The main receptor neurokinin B interacts with is the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R). The Neurokinin 3 receptor is a part of a larger family of G-protein coupled receptors that binds all tachykinin proteins. While neurokinin B has the ability to bind to other Neurokinin receptors, the highest affinity lies in that of the NK3R receptor group. Much like the neurokinin B peptide, the NK3R receptor that it binds to is encoded within five exons of the TACR3 gene in humans and the Tacr3 gene in mice and other rodents. High concentrations of the NK3R receptor are found in both the central nervous system and the spinal cord. Additional NK3R receptors have also been found in various other places in the body including: uterus, mesenteric vein, gut neurons, and placenta. Neurokinin B has also been found to co-localize certain gonadal steroid hormone receptors. These include the estrogen receptor (ERŒ±), progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor. It has been found that co-localization of the NKB neurons near these receptors is at a much higher concentration than even that of other peptides and chemicals. The kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin cell groups are found to be co- localized to more than 95% of all of the aforementioned receptors in the arcuate nucleus. Role of gonadotropin-releasing hormone Mutations or defects in the TAC3 or TAC3R gene can lead to steroidal feedback problems in the GnRH pulse generator loop, causing GnRH to be understimulated. Lack of GnRH ultimately leads to hypogonadism. A review of neurokinin B and its sister peptides, kisspeptin and dynorphin, in sheep found that these KNDy cell groups (kisspeptin, neurokinin B, dynorphin), are in direct contact with the GnRH neuronal bodies in both the preoptic area and the mediobasal hypothalamus. Researchers found this to be feature to be conserved among species including humans. Due to the high percentage of co-localization found with neurokinin B cell bodies and receptor groups, it is suggested that Neurokinin b along with kisspeptin and dynorphin play a role in the release of GnRH. These findings are important since GnRH release plays such a pivotal role in regulating hormonal control in the bodies of humans. Role in pre-eclampsia Pre- eclampsia is a disorder found in around 5% of pregnant women, usually presenting in the 37th week of gestation, with prognosis ranging from mild to severe. While mild forms of the disease do not significantly impact mother or fetus, more severe cases may lead to blood vessel constriction, increased blood pressure, and reduced blood flow. This in turn can damage various organ systems including the brain, liver, kidneys, and heart. Dangers to the fetus occur when restricted blood flow due to high pressures causes a lack of blood flow to the uterus. This can result in a number of problems for the fetus including poor growth, lack of amniotic fluid, and placental abruption. H&E; stain of Placenta During Pre-Eclampsia The cause of pre-eclampsia is not known. Research indicates that the tachykinin peptide neurokinin B may play a role, as placental expression of the TAC3 gene, which codes for NKB, was found in high levels in women with pre-eclampsia. Usually not located in peripheral tissue, high levels of TAC3 gene were found in both maternal plasma and placental blood, including blood from the umbilical cord. TAC3 in this case was able to secrete NKB in order to affect the circulation of the fetus. Additional studies done on rodents introduced to high levels of NKB indicated the vasoregulatory properties of the peptide, such as the vasoconstriction found in cases of pre-eclampsia. Increased NKB secretions seem to be caused by defective implantation or invasion of the embryo at the trophoblast stage. In most cases of pre-eclampsia, the trophoblast was unable to fully invade into the uterine lining and has been an almost constant feature in documented cases. This leads to increased signaling of NKB factors. In cases of defective implantation, NKB is vital to increase blood flow to the placenta. However, it seems as though depending on which receptor NKB binds, the peptide can cause both constriction and dilation of the blood vessels. The NK1 receptor was studied and found to cause vasodilation while the NK3 receptor was found to cause vasoconstriction. Higher levels of NK3 receptor seem to be found in pregnant woman suffering from pre-eclampsia. NKB usually found in the brain, has been found in the placenta at a concentration of 2.6 times that of the NKB in the brain, possibly leading to the onset of pre-eclampsia in mothers. Studies in non-human animals Much like the human TAC3 gene, Tac2 in rodents facilitates the expression of the neurokinin B peptide. Rodent studies have been done and compared to human studies to elucidate the function of NKB. For cases in which human studies are not possible, rodent studies are substituted due to the conserved similarity between TAC3 and Tac2, and NKB with the TAC3R and Tac2r receptor genes. Studies show that in postmenopausal woman there is an increased expression of tachykinin neurons in the arcuate nucleus. In order to replicate the condition of the post-menopausal woman, an ovariectomized rat is used. The removal of the ovaries simulates the condition of menopause in rats and allows for comparative studies to be done. It was found that in these ovariectomized rats there was a significant increase in the number of NKB neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Along with rats, primate studies have been done, investigating the effects of NKB and the other peptides of the KNDy subpopulation. Due to the similarity in brain structure monkeys have been good research candidates. In humans, as previously mentioned, NKB signaling plays a vital role in hormone secretion, especially that of luteinizing hormone before the onset of puberty. It was shown, in monkeys, that activation of NK3R, the NKB receptor, was associated with release of hormones that come before the onset of puberty. This included initial release of GnRH. NKB found mostly in the arcuate nucleus in humans, is found mostly in the monkey hypothalamus. By injecting NKB analogs pulsatile GnRH was secreted, activating the hypothalmic-pituitary axis and therefore releasing LH. Researchers found these results consistent across both monkey and human brains.

He was a successful wide receiver and punt/kick returner who played professional football for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Arizona Cardinals in the National Football League; as well as the Tampa Bay Storm in the Arena Football League. Signed by Tampa Bay as an undrafted free agent out of small school Texas A&M-Kingsville; Karl Williams retired as the all-time Buccaneers leader in punt return yardage (2,565) and punt return touchdowns (5) across 8 seasons with the club; records that still stand today. Despite Williams' success in the NFL, he said, ‚ÄúFrom the first time I stepped on a football field, everybody told me I couldn‚Äôt do it. It seems like every year I found a way to prove everybody wrong. If you say I can‚Äôt do it I‚Äôm going to prove you wrong.‚Äù Williams overcame playing college ball at a virtually unknown school (Texas A&M; Kingsville), a small frame (5 foot 10, 177 pounds), and going undrafted by NFL teams. Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Tony Dungy brought him on as an undrafted free agent in 1996. Williams said about these early years in the NFL, ‚ÄúI remember those last phone calls when they were making the final cuts my rookie year. It was me and Jeff Gooch, and we were sitting around waiting for that phone call. We called it the Grim Reaper. Everyone was packing up and getting ready to go home and we were still waiting. Then they came around and said ‚ÄòDid you get the call? No? Then you‚Äôre good.‚Äô I remember Jeff and I just falling back and saying, ‚ÄòYeah!‚Äô‚Äù As an NFL rookie he established himself as Tampa Bay‚Äôs primary kick and punt return man by the end of the season. He earned the NFC‚Äôs Special Team‚Äôs Player of the Month award for December that first year in 1996. Williams parlayed his success as a return man into more reps as a wide-receiver. His 1997 campaign was his best ever at wideout; he achieved 486 receiving yards and 4 touchdowns in that role. Williams also continued to be a successful punt return specialist, and was picked as a candidate to end the Bucs‚Äô kickoff-return drought. The team had never returned a kick for a touchdown in its 30-year history. However, the majority of Williams' success concerned return punts and not on kickoffs; and the team would not return a kick until Michael Spurlock did so in 2007. Although he was not successful at kickoffs, Williams scored with some regularity as a punt-returner, recording one touchdown each in the 1996 and 1997 seasons as well as one each year from 2000-2002. At the end of the 2002 season he achieved the game's highest honor by becoming a Super Bowl Champion. A member of the first and only championship Tampa Bay squad; Williams‚Äô Bucs were led by Hall of Famers linebacker Derrick Brooks and defensive tackle Warren Sapp on defense, and game-manager quarterback Brad Johnson on offense. Behind head coach Jon Gruden, the Buccaneers went 12-4 during the regular season, defeated their chief rivals the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship game, and dominated the Super Bowl against the Oakland Raiders, winning 48-21 to bring the Lombardi Trophy to the Tampa Bay area. Williams left Tampa Bay after the following season and signed with the Arizona Cardinals, playing one year in the desert before leaving the NFL for good at the end of the 2004 season. Williams also remains a fan favorite in the Tampa Bay area. Part of the source of his popularity can be found in his nickname, ‚ÄúThe Truth.‚Äù He got his nickname largely because it was the nickname of journeyman boxer of the 1980s and 1990s Carl Williams. He was most famous for going toe to toe with some of boxing's best including Larry Holmes (who Williams lost a controversial decision to) and to Mike Tyson. Like the boxer, he achieved despite his humble beginnings, his modest college, and his undrafted status to achieve greatness at football's highest level. Williams has earned a Super Bowl Ring n On his career as a punt returner Williams has said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs being a ballplayer. Everyone talks about me as a punt returner, and they made me a punt returner in my rookie year because that was the only way I could get on the field.‚Äù His rags to riches story has led to Williams‚Äô ownership of a small gym in Texas, where he encourages the youth of his alma mater that everyone can be successful. He is now teaching the determination and willingness to do whatever it takes that he embraced so well as a player. When asked the truth about him, old coach Jon Gruden said about Karl Williams, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a humble guy, a guy who‚Äôs worked for everything he has and that‚Äôs one of the winning edges he brings to our football team and something I really appreciate about him.‚Äù His cousin, Mondray Gee, is an assistant coach in the NFL.

Student athletics Pollard played as a wide receiver and return specialist at William Mitchell High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The team were undefeated state champions in 1981. Pollard played college football at Weber State University for three years (1983‚Äì1985). He came to Weber State as a running back but was moved to cornerback prior to his sophomore season. He led the Wildcats with four interceptions as a senior, earning all-conference honors. Pollard was rated as the 24th defensive cornerback in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to be chosen for the 1986 NFL Draft. Professional career Pollard was originally signed as a free agent by the Seattle Seahawks on May 3, 1986, but was waived. He was signed during the next off-season by the San Francisco 49ers on April 10, 1987, but repeatedly released, waived, and re-signed, before gaining a stable place on the organization's roster from September 1988 to August 1992. In the 1988 season, Pollard took part in 14 games as part of the core special teams and playing in nickel-and-dime defense. He made 23 tackles and four pass deflections. He also played in all post-season games. Pollard made an alert recovery of John Taylor's fumble of a punt return in Super Bowl XXIII against Cincinnati. In the 1989 season, Pollard started as the left cornerback, starting in 14 games and playing 16. He recorded career- highs in tackles (79), solo tackles (75) and passes defensed (12), and led the team with 22 special team stops.

The 49ers placed Pollard on waivers on August 31, 1992, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers claimed him the next day. He played all 16 games of the 1992 season for the Buccaneers as a cornerback, nickel back and special teamer. He achieved a career-high in interceptions, including a 75-yard return to set-up a Buccaneer touchdown against the Chicago Bears. Pollard spend the entire 1993 season on injured reserve after being diagnosed with a herniated disk in his neck after a pre- season game against the Denver Broncos. Pollard retired from the NFL in 1994. In 1995, Pollard joined the Arena Football League, signing a one-year contract with the San Jose SaberCats as a defensive back and wide receiver. Retirement Pollard is the district production sales manager in Northern California for Oc√© North America, Inc. and resides in San Francisco, California.

In Lagos, these group also receive payments from market women as a form of protection against theft. = Boma boys (1940s) = The phenomenon of Boma boys in Lagos was ascribed to a group of unlicensed guides of African and Europeans servicemen who operated prominently during World War II. The boys were based around the Marina, some were stowaways on ships who went to Freetown where the use of the word, bum meant to beg. On their return to Lagos they hung around the Marina duping unsuspecting students of their school fees under the pretext they could arrange for them to travel abroad as stowaways. When ships berth in the Marina, the boys show the way to the restaurants, hotels and brothels in Lagos to newly arrived sailors. When prostitution rose in Lagos, Boma boys were linked to its rise as a result of their activities conveying targets to brothels. = Thugs and touts = The use of the new nomenclature, touts or thugs to describe juvenile undesirables began in the 1950s. These youths who performed visible employment working in motor parks replaced the Boma and Jaguda boys in the 1950s. These group were known as bullies who also work for politicians, they are closer to their modern day offspring, the Area boys.  Area boys  The nomenclature of Area boys can also mean touts, Alaayes, Agberos, omo onile, they are generally considered deviant youths who use extortion, exploitation, petty crimes and sometimes violent means to earn income. These group grew along with the emergence of a growing informal economy of street trading. Many previously worked at the motor parks or as helps to carry loads for market customers. Their activities expanded into acting as security for businessmen and politicians, bouncers, or means to harass tenants, loan defaulters, or the electoral process. Area boys like their name, are boys known in the neighborhood, unlike their predecessors, Jagudas and Boma boys, Area boys were less likely to be recent migrants. The boys are easily identified in the neighborhood and have a base location for meetings. The base membership straddles employed and unemployed youths. To earn income, the unemployed youths move outwards towards a junction or intersection where they don on outfits as union members of a road transport association or engage in security related commerce that verges on extortion. New contractors are billed owo ile or land levy, market traders are billed owo security which is money for security and there is street money or owo ita which is compensation to the area boys for commerce related activities within the neighborhood. Demographics Area boys have existed in the city of Lagos since the early 1980s. However, under various names, types of Area Boys have been traced back to the 1920s.^ Simon Heap, \\"Their Days are Spent in Gambling and Loafing, Pimping for Prostitutes, and Picking Pockets\\": Male Juvenile Delinquents on Lagos Island, Nigeria, 1920s-60s', Journal of Family History, 35 (1), 2010, 48-70; http://jfh.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/0363199009348306v1 In 2007, the total number of area boys in Lagos was estimated at over 35,000 by a member of the Lagos State Judiciary; as of 1996, the number of them operating on Lagos Island alone was placed around 1,000. A 1996 study of area boys on Lagos Island by Abubakar Momoh showed that only 26.4% of area boys were from Lagos State, while the rest were natives of Ogun State (22.6%), Kwara State (14.2%), and Oyo State (14.1%), amongst other states. Most were between twelve and thirty-five years old.Momoh, p. 194 Asked whether they were \\"proud\\" to be area boys, 18% of respondents said yes, while 75% said no (7% did not respond).Momoh, p. 191 Tactics and targets A United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 2001 report on Nigeria described the impact of the gang members as such: > The coercive and persuasive requests, petty crimes and sometimes violent > offences by the so-called \\"area boys\\" to acquire resources, generally cash > in the urban main business and crowded areas, have disturbed the civil > society and defied the civic authority. Drug abuse among them has been > variously reported as the cause of delinquent behaviour and crime. =Extortion= One of the methods Area Boys use for extortion is to surround pedestrians, drivers, and passengers in vehicles, which are stuck in traffic, and force them to pay for some actual or fictitious service before letting them go. To aid in collecting money during traffic jams, the area boys place nails in the road and dig up the streets. When the streets are flooded, however, they also aid motorists in avoiding ditches and pot holes amidst other services.Momoh, p. 193 According to Momoh, much of the extortion from Igbo merchants by area boys is instigated by Lagos landlords, indigenous inhabitants of the city.Momoh, p. 190 =Illegal drug sale= Among the area boys are both sellers and users of illegal drugs. This drug use has been linked as the cause of further crime. A study states \\"most of them use drugs (cocaine, heroin, marijuana, etc.) either as occasional users or addicts, or as peddlers.\\" Of 77 respondents to a survey, 12.2% dealt drugs, while 60.3% were addicts themselves. Sale of drugs takes place both in Nigeria and abroad, and sales abroad have earned a small percentage of the sellers significant amounts of money.Momoh, p. 195 Groups of area boys have been known to raid rival, Igbo drug sellers based in Central Lagos. Notable incidents involving area boys During the Hausa-Yoruba riots in Lagos in 2000, where thousands of Hausa fled to military barracks and nearly 100 people died, area boys took advantage of the chaos and joined in the mayhem, throwing glass and bottles at shops. At the Mile 12 Market (also in Lagos), soldiers were reported to work hand in hand with gang members as late as 2004. However, in May 2005, after a Nigerian soldier was assaulted and stabbed by several area boys as he tried to prevent them from taking money from a bus driver, the military began a crackdown against the group. Following this, the group's activity was noted to be in decline. Area boys elsewhere in Nigeria *Petty criminals have been labeled as \\"area boys\\" in Ibadan, where they control informal markets and are used to advance political causes. *In the Yankari National Park in Bauchi State, baboons have been referred to as \\"area boys\\" because of their troublesome behavior. * They were cited as a nuisance by the Director of Communications at Airtel in August 2012 because they demanded money to load diesel at the company's Base Transceiver Stations.

It is a jawless fish with a sucking mouth on one end of it (like a leech.) It can appear to be a small eel, since it is rarely longer than 1 foot in length. The southern brook lamprey is a non-parasitic fish native to distinctive aquatic habitats in North America which must be protected in order for this species to continue to thrive. I. gagei inhabits a geographic area stretching from southern Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida along the Gulf Coast west to Oklahoma and Texas and have been reported as far north as Minnesota and Wisconsin.Beamish, F.W.H. 1982. Biology of the Southern Brook Lamprey. Environmental Biology of Fishes. (7) p.305-320.Cochran, P.A., Fago, D., Lyons, J. 2000. Wisconsin Fishes 2000: Status and Distribution. http://www.seagrant.wisc.edu/greatlakesfish/lyons.html. 18 November 2012. I. gagei inhabits specific types of microhabitats at different morphological phases of its life cycle which consists of two distinct stages. During the larval stage, I. gagei are most often found burrowed into fine sandy creek substrate, but are also occasionally found burrowed among dense clusters of leaves or other aquatic vegetation. Ammocoetes, or larval stage lampreys, feed on diatoms and other organic particles collected mainly off the substrate.Gallaway, B.J., Moshin, A.K.M. 1977. Seasonal Abundance, Distribution, Food Habits, and Condition of the Southern Brook Lamprey, Ichthyomyzon gagei, In an East Texas Watershed. The Southwestern Naturalist. (22) p.107-114. I. gagei larvae typically undergo metamorphosis after 3 years; however, some ammocoetes stay in the larval stage for an additional year. Following metamorphosis from the larval stage, the adult stage is reached. During this phase, I. gagei does not eat; rather, it obtains energy from stored fat reserves collected as ammocoetes and also migrates from slow moving streams to faster moving water with slightly larger pebbles as opposed to fine sandy substrate. This fasting behavior continues until spawning during which adult lampreys come together from late April to early May and spawn in habitats consisting of small, shallow ripples with 17-21 ¬∞C water. Although I. gagei populations have been found to be generally stable, due to the strict habitat requirements during each phase of its life cycle, the quality of each of these habitats must be preserved in order to ensure that the specific niche filled by the southern brook lamprey is protected. Geographic distribution The southern brook lamprey occurs in slow moving rivers and streams from Florida to southern Mississippi, Georgia, and Arkansas along the Gulf Coast west to Oklahoma and Texas. The southern brook lamprey ranges as far north as Minnesota and Wisconsin. Specifically, southern brook lamprey have been reported to occur in the Chattahoochee river system and the Conecuh river system in Alabama, the Sabine river system in Texas and Louisiana, the Illinois river system in Oklahoma, and the Neches river system in Texas. The southern brook lamprey was thought to be restricted to the southern United States; however, Becker observed southern brook lamprey in Wisconsin in 1983. The southern brook lamprey has also been reported to occur as far north as the Spruce river and the Tamarac river in Wisconsin and Minnesota.Cochran, P.A., Pettinelli, T.C. 2012. Northern and Southern Brook Lampreys (Ichthyomyzon fossor and Ichthyomyzon gagei) in Minnesota. Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/eco/nongame/projects/consgrant_reports/1987/1987_cochran.pdf. p. 1-12. Unpublished findings have also shown that the southern brook lamprey inhabits tributaries of Choctawhatchee Bay and the Ochlockonnee river system in Florida, the Chattahoochee river system in Georgia, and the Trinity and San Jacinto river systems in Texas.Dendy, J.S., Scott, D.C. 1953. Distribution, Life History, and Morphological Variations of the Southern Brook Lamprey, Ichthyomyzon gagei. Copeia. (3). p. 152-162. Ecology The diet of the southern brook lamprey changes as it undergoes metamorphosis during its life cycle from one phase to the next. The diet of larval southern brook lamprey consists mainly of organic detritus. Studies that focused on closely related lamprey species (I. fossor) found that the guts of larval lampreys contained 97.9% organic detritus, 2.12% algae, and 0.09% bacteria.Bowen, S.H., Sutton, T.M. 1994. Significance of Organic Detritus in the Diet of Larval Lampreys in the Great Lakes Basin. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. (51). p. 2380-2387. After metamorphosis into the adult phase, southern brook lampreys do not feed but rely on stored fat reserves accumulated during the larval stage for energy and nutrients. Studies have found that the digestive tract of the southern brook lamprey actually shrinks and becomes functionally useless as larval lampreys enter the adult stage. The southern brook lamprey encounters a wide range of predators in its natural habitat. The eggs of adult lampreys are preyed on by various species of fish and crayfish.Renaud, C.B. 1997. Conservation Status of Northern Hemisphere Lampreys (Petromyzontidae). Journal of Applied Ichthyology. (13) p. 143-148. Southern brook lampreys in the larval stage serve as prey for a wide range of fish and bird species. Adult forms of the Southern brook lamprey are preyed upon by larger fish species such as the Northern pike (E. lucius), perch species, the European chub (S. cephalus), and the mudpuppy (N. maculosus). The southern brook lamprey shares similar habitats and resources with many species of shiners (Notropis), the longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), Johnny darters (Etheostoma nigrum), and mottled sculpins (Cottus bairdi).Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/rsg/profile.html?action=elementDetail&selectedElement;=AFBAA01040. 18 November 2012. Life history The southern brook lamprey's life cycle consists of two main stages: larval and adult. During the larval stage, the southern brook lamprey inhabits a distinct micro habitat involving relatively slow moving water and a sandy substrate. The consistency of the substrate is vitally important to the Southern brook lamprey because during the larval stage, the southern brook lamprey burrows into the substrate using its oral disk as an anchor.Beamish, F.W.H., Jebbink, J. 1994. Abundance of Lamprey Larvae and Physical Habitat. Environmental Biology of Fishes. (39) p. 209-214. The southern brook lamprey secretes mucus from its body to form a tube leading to the entrance of the burrow and to provide support for the burrow. The formation of this larval burrow relies on the composition and size of the substrate available. The combination of both small and large particles and coarse and fine sand grains allow the southern brook lamprey to construct a suitable burrow that allows enough water to flow through the burrow to ensure proper respiration. The substrate in which larval southern brook lamprey burrow must not contain too many fine silt and clay particles as this would inhibit respiration while too many particles of coarse sand would hinder proper burrow construction. The larval stage is complete after approximately three years. Following the larval stage, the southern brook lamprey undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. Adult southern brook lamprey are found in crevices and cracks between large rocks in deeper, faster moving water than the habitat occupied during the larval stage. After completing the metamorphosis to adults, southern brook lampreys come together in groups to spawn and, once spawning is complete, the adults die.Williams, J., Zellers, R.2006. Arkansas Fish .p10. www.agfc.com/resources/Publications/ar_fish.pdf. 14 November 2012. Spawning usually occurs between April and May and takes place in another distinct microhabitat consisting of shallow riffle areas with rocky substrate with a water temperature falling between 17 ¬∞C to 21 ¬∞C. Fecundity of the southern brook lamprey averages between 800 and 2500 oocytes. Human factors have been found to influence the available habitat for spawning southern brook lampreys. Southern brook lampreys have been recorded using shallow areas under bridges as spawning grounds possibly to help conceal spawning aggregations from visual predators. Current management The southern brook lamprey is currently listed as a species of \\"least concern\\" in the United States by CN Red List.Oldsberg, R. 2011. Ichthyomyzon gagei. http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Ichthyomyzon_gagei/ 18 November 2012. The southern brook lamprey has also not been given any status regarding endangerment by the US Federal List or CITES. Currently there are no conservation plans in action specific to the southern brook lamprey, nor laws or protected waterways aimed at conservation. No evidence of biological factors has been found that would contribute to a decline in the abundance or the range of the southern brook lamprey; in fact, the biggest threat to the southern brook lamprey and closely related species is human-induced alteration of suitable microhabitats. In order to preserve these specific types of microhabitats used by the southern brook lamprey during each phase of the life cycle, habitat preservation and rehabilitation of affected microhabitats are essential. Microhabitats used by the southern brook lamprey during all life stages must have a certain water temperature, substrate composition, and water quality in order for the southern brook lamprey to successfully inhabit and spawn in these areas.

He went to college at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in 1995, went to the San Diego Chargers in 2001, and last played for the Atlanta Falcons in 2002. Holecek played in the NFL for 8 seasons, and then returned to Chicago area. He currently coaches football at Loyola Academy - who won the 2015 and 2018 Class 8A Illinois Football State Championships. Holecek was a finalist for the 2015 National Coach of the Year award.  Marian Catholic career  Holecek was a three-sport athlete at Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights, Illinois, excelling in wrestling, baseball, and football. Holecek was selected to a Chicago all-star baseball team that toured Europe his junior summer, but he decided to play football after receiving multiple Big Ten and division one scholarship offers. Holecek played both tight end and middle linebacker for Marian coach Dave Mattio. Coach Mattio reflected on Holecek in a 2001 Times newspaper interview, \\"Most people don't know he was a good catcher and could have been a great wrestler,\\" Mattio said. \\"Even then, I saw how he never quit and everything had to be perfect. He was a tough kid, I compare him to street kid because of his toughness and being hard-nosed on the field. He played hard and the thing about John, he could run for a big guy\\". Holecek finished his high school career with 243 tackles, 13 sacks, two fumble recoveries, three interceptions, two punts blocked, 16 receptions and 2 TD passes. Holecek was All-State and named the ‚ÄúDefensive Player of the Year‚Äù his senior year by a metro newspaper. Holecek had his NFL jersey number 52 retired by his alma mater in 2000. Other retired Marian jerseys include Mike Prior and high school and one-season NFL teammate Rodney Harrison (San Diego Chargers). Illinois career After graduation from Marian Catholic High School (Illinois), John played for the Illinois Fighting Illini football team from 1990 to 1994. Holecek was the Illini's co- Defensive Player of the Year in his red-shirt freshman season. Holecek made the All-Big in 1993 and 1994 teams, and was also a team captain. Holecek suffered multiple ACL injuries during his Illinois career, dampening prior Butkus Award consideration. Holecek was part of the linebacker foursome that gave Illinois the nickname \\"Linebacker U\\" in the 1990s. The Foursome also featured All-American and first-round, second and third overall draft picks, Simeon Rice and Kevin Hardy, as well as, Butkus award winner Dana Howard. Illinois led the nation in total defense for most of Holecek's senior season. Illinois participated in college bowl games each of Holecek's seasons. Holecek is fifth on the Illinois career tackles list with 436 (above another Chicago area Illinois linebacker great Dick Butkus) and was twice named honorable mention All-America. Holecek graduated as a finance major (on the Dean's list) with some credits towards his master's degree. Holecek's arm-wrestling match with his childhood hero, legendary Walter Payton, was stated to be one of his greatest college football-related moments. Lou Tepper, former Illinois coach and author of \\"Complete Linebacking\\" described John's aggressive linebacker playing style as \\"a natural presser\\" and called John \\"a fiery leader and competitor\\". Tepper praised Holecek in a college pre-season magazine, stating \\"He will bite, chew, and claw his way to make the play. He has incredible toughness and intelligence, and that is rare combination.\\" NFL career Holecek was drafted in 1995 by the Buffalo Bills in the fifth round if the NFL draft (144th pick) of the 1995 draft. Holecek was drafted by Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Marv Levy. Holecek also played for NFL coach Wade Phillips. Holecek had hoped to be drafted by his hometown Chicago Bears, and had discussions with the new head coach Dave Wannstedt. The Bears instead drafted Sean Harris from Arizona, who had a brief NFL tenure. Holecek reported to the perennial Super Bowl bound Bills rookie camp in April 1995. He played six seasons with the Bills, averaging over 14 starts his last three seasons. Holecek flourished as an inside linebacker in Phillips' defensive 3-4 system. He also briefly played middle linebacker in a 4-3 alignment when injuries caused Coach Phillips to switch defenses mid-season. John emerged as a defensive stalwart and on-field coach for the Bills, notching an incredible 414 tackles from 1998-2000 and became known for his technique and football acumen. Holecek started eight games over the course of his first three seasons with the Bills (1995-1998). After playing in only one game his rookie season due to injury, Holecek was ready to be a regular contributor to the team in 1996 before another knee injury suffered in the first preseason game forced him to spend the entire year on injured reserve. Holecek also pursued completion of his MBA degree these seasons. In 1997 Holecek provided the first glimpse of his promising future as he recorded 86 combined tackles in eight starts (14 appearances). Head coach Marc Levy stated decades later that Holecek was one of his favorite NFL players to coach. In 1998 Holecek led the Bills with 133 tackles in his first season as a full-time starter and was named the team's recipient of the Ed Block Courage Award. Holecek was credited with a career game high of 21 tackles during game film review of the Miami Dolphins Wild Card playoff game. That season the Bills improved to the fifth- rated run defense in the NFL‚Äîup from 15th the year before. In 1999 Holecek tallied 116 combined tackles, including 63 unassisted, to go along with one sack, one interception, six passes defensed and two forced fumbles. Holecek's remarkable season also included a career-best 22-tackle outing in a Wild Card Playoff game played at Tennessee. His finest campaign came in 2000 when he started all 16 games and had a career-high 165 combined tackles. He also intercepted one pass and deflected four others. In his seventh season, Holecek was released very late in training camp in salary cap move by a new Bills head coach and GM. Holecek was quickly signed by the San Diego Chargers. The Bills who ranked 3rd in total defense in the league in 2000, finished 3-13 without Holecek and others in 2001. John played in San Diego for one partial season; he finished the last five games of the season on injured reserve as a knee problems limited him to just 11 injury-riddled appearances. Holecek then signed with the Atlanta Falcons in his 8th season (2002). Holecek was reunited with Falcon defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who tutored Holecek for six seasons while serving as defensive coordinator or head coach of the Buffalo Bills. Holecek started the first 11 games for the play-off bound Falcons and was the team's second leading tackler before breaking his upper wrist/forearm. Holecek seriously re-injured his right arm late and knee and the resulting surgery was career ending. Loyola Academy coaching career  After retiring from the NFL, Holecek returned to Illinois to work in finance and assist coaching high school football at St. Ignatius in Chicago. At the insistence of Nick Rassas (NFL safety, Notre Dame All-American, and Loyola Academy graduate) Holecek applied for the head coach position at Loyola Academy, a private college preparatory in Wilmette, Illinois. NFL coaches Marv Levy and Wade Phillips called the school's AD Pat Mahoney on Holecek's behalf. Mahoney remembered ‚ÄúYou could see that he was a teacher of the game... He was smart and driven. He wasn‚Äôt going to do anything half-heartedly.‚Äù Holecek is Loyola's head varsity football coach and as the assistant athletic director. Since taking the reins in 2006, Holecek's teams have been to the playoffs every year, including nine the last ten Illinois State 8A Semi-Finals or Finals and the four consecutive Illinois State 8A Finals since 2018. Holecek's teams have won at least 11 games for the last nine consecutive years (as of 2018). Loyola plays in the Chicago Catholic League Blue division. Loyola has won outright or shared six of the last eight CCLB conference titles (as of 2018). Holecek's career coaching record is 146‚Äì30 with an 83% overall winning percentage; including over 91% of games in the last four full seasons (2015-2018). Holecek's Ramblers are 18‚Äì2 in the state playoffs over the last four years, winning two State Championships. In 2008, he coached Loyola to a Prep Bowl Championship at Soldier Field as the L.A. Ramblers defeated Lane Tech, 17‚Äì0. The 2009 team played in the state semi-finals. The 2010 team was the start of Holecek's run on Chicago Catholic League Blue championships. In 2011, he coached the Ramblers to a second-place finish in the Class 8A State Championship, losing to Bolingbrook High School 21‚Äì17 in inclement weather. This was only the school's third appearance in the state championship game and the first in 18 years. In August 2012, Holecek brought his Ramblers to Dublin, Ireland to play Jesuit Dallas in Global Ireland Football Tournament 2012, featuring Notre Dame vs Navy as the main draw. That same year John Holecek joined Dick Butkus in making an instructional video one of one Butkus's websites to emphasize tackling with proper form to reduce the risk of head injury. Loyola was a state semi-finalist in 2012. Loyola was the 8A state championship runner-up in 2013, after losing to Naperville Central 13‚Äì10 in the title game. In April 2014, Holecek's coaching mentor Marv Levy visited Loyola as part of the NFL \\"Heart of a Hall of Famer\\" program. Levy's lessons were laced with words like ‚Äúperseverance‚Äù, ‚Äúwork ethic‚Äù, and ‚Äúpreparation‚Äù, hallmarks of Holecek's playing career and coaching tenure at Loyola. Loyola Academy won the Chicago Prep Bowl 14-7 over Chicago Curie at Soldier Field on November 28, 2014. Playing not the road with their third-string QB, LA had previously lost a close state playoff game against the eventual state champions. In late September 2015, John Holecek notched his 100th coaching victory‚Äîbecoming the first Illinois high school football coach to reach 100 wins in so short of a career span (9 1/2 seasons). At the close of the regular season in October 2015, Loyola ranked number 1 in the state of Illinois in all major football polls after completing a 9-0 undefeated regular season, by way of a 34-point average margin of victory (24-point lowest margin of victory). Holecek told the Chicago Tribune, \\"We haven't thrown one ball in the fourth quarter\\". Loyola won the 2015 Chicago Catholic League Blue conference title after a 49‚Äì21 victory over defending 7A State Champion Mt. Carmel. In November 2015, Loyola won their first four playoff games to go to 13‚Äì0, including a dominating (early third quarter running clock) victory over the defending 8A champion Stevenson 49‚Äì0, a come-from-behind victory over Homewood Flossmor (who was rated #1 in the state for the first eight weeks of the season) in a televised game attended by over 6,000 fans, and a close semi-final victory over Palatine in the snow. Loyola Academy ranked in the top 20 nationally by Maxpreps Experts, Freeman, and USA Today and number 6 nationally in the USA Today Super 25 Computer Rankings. On November 28, 2015, Loyola played Marist for the state title and utilized an aggressive defensive scheme with many blitz packages. LA defeated Marist 41‚Äì0 (with a running clock imposed) to win the IHSA class 8A State Championship, extending its season record to 14‚Äì0. For the 2015 season LA outscored its opponents 558‚Äì123, won nine games by 30 points or more, and had six shut-outs. Loyola finished the regular 2016 season 9-0 as the Ramblers (#1 ranked team in Illinois) defeated #2 ranked Mount Carmel early in the season and #3 ranked Brother Rice to close the season (both games were on the road). Loyola players were paid a visit by NFL legend Marv Levy prior to the beginning the 2016 8A IHSA playoffs (#1 seed). At the end of October, Holecek's Ramblers ranked #5 nationally (USA Today Super 25 Computer Rankings) and had a 26-game win streak, plus had a 24-game home field winning streak that dates back to 2012. LA finished as runner-up in 2016 in class 8A. Loyola finished the regular season at 8‚Äì1 in 2017 and the Ramblers‚Äô won their third consecutive undefeated and outright Catholic Blue League title in a row (with Holecek again receiving Coach of the Year awards). LA's home win streak stood at 29 games (including a victory against perennial Californian powerhouse Bishop Amat) as the playoffs began. In early Nov 2017, Holecek became the school's all-time coaching leader with 133 wins - including the last ten in a row and 31 consecutive victories at home. In November 2018, Loyola Academy beat their first three playoff opponents, including two shutouts, and qualified for their ninth IHSA 8A semifinals in the last ten years. Loyola went on to beat Brother Rice 13‚Äì3 in the 8A final game on November 24, 2018. Underdogs Loyola beat the 14th, 6th (10-1 Maine South), 3rd (undefeated Oswego), 2nd (12-0 and reigning 8a champion Lincoln Way East) and 1st seeds (13-0 Brother Rice) during their playoff run.

Football career Born in Montreal, Quebec, Kane played college football at Syracuse University. A third-round draft pick, Kane played for the Seattle Seahawks from 1988 to 1992, when his season ended early due to ankle and knee injuries. The Seahawks cut him during training camp in the following year, and Kane moved to the Canadian Football League. He played five games for the Toronto Argonauts in 1994.Ex-NFL star Tommy Kane sentenced 18 years, November 11, 2004. CBC Sports. At the end of his pro career, Kane volunteered at youth football camps sponsored by Montreal's Westend Sport Association, which he had attended as a youth. While with the Argonauts, he donated a year's salary to the Centre. Kane is of Black Nova Scotian descent. Crime and legal proceedings In 1988, while at Syracuse University, Kane was arrested for assaulting a police officer after the officer attempted to have his illegally-parked car towed. He was charged with second-degree assault, second-degree obstructing governmental administration and resisting arrest. He was subsequently sentenced to community service. On November 30, 2003, Kane severely beat and then stabbed his estranged wife, Tammara Shaikh, in his mother's house in LaSalle, Quebec. Shaikh, 35, died in the arms of a church counsellor from Kane's church who had accompanied her to the home with the intention of escorting Kane to a detox center. The couple had recently separated. Originally charged with second-degree murder, Kane pleaded guilty to manslaughter for the act. Prosecutors took his depression into account, agreeing to the lesser count. There was a dispute as to whether he intended to murder his wife and claimed during his trial that he didn't remember the attack fully. Kane was ultimately sentenced to 18 years in prison. In 2010, Quebec judge Clement Gascon ordered Kane to pay damages of $590,000 to Tammara Shaikh's family. $125,000 was awarded to each of Kane and Shaikh's four children and $90,000 to Tammara's sister, Ava Shaikh, who had gained legal custody of the children after Tammara's murder. In late 2015, the Canadian Parole Board approved Kane for six months of day parole while he continued to serve his 18 year sentence.

His family moved to Ontario, Canada where he attended Oakville Trafalgar High School. He set a high school javelin record that lasted for 35 years. Andrusyshyn participated with the Canadian team in the javelin throw, shot put and discus during the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. He held the Canadian javelin record with a throw of 242 feet 6 inches. He received a track and field scholarship from UCLA to compete in the javelin throw, but suffered an elbow injury while preparing for the 1968 Summer Olympics and decided to walk-on to the football team after kicking in a tryout 14 field goals in a row from 45 yards out. In one practice he kicked field goals of 57 and 62 yards. Andrusyshyn was used both as a punter and placekicker.

The strike began in May 1936 and ended in April 1937, although the strike settlement would not be fully implemented until mid-1940. The strike is notorious for spawning the \\"Mohawk Valley formula,\\" a corporate plan for strikebreaking to discredit union leaders, frighten the public with the threat of violence, use local police and vigilantes to intimidate strikers, form puppet associations of \\"loyal employees\\" to influence public debate, fortify workplaces, employ large numbers of strikebreakers, and threaten to close the plant if work is not resumed. The Mohawk Valley formula was described in an article by company president James Rand, Jr., and published in the National Association of Manufacturers Labor Relations Bulletin in the fourth month of the strike. The article was widely disseminated in pamphlet form by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) later that year. In a landmark decision, the National Labor Relations Board called the Mohawk Valley formula \\"a battle plan for industrial war.\\"Quote in \\"Glossary, History at the Department of Labor,\\" U.S. Department of Labor, no date. The \\"Mohawk Valley formula\\" refers to the town of Ilion, New York, which is located in the Mohawk Valley. Background In March 1934, the AFL began organizing skilled workers at two typewriter companies, Underwood Typewriter Company and Remington Rand. The employees organized the District Council of Office Equipment Workers, a federal union affiliated with the Metal Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor. Six plants were organized in the towns of Tonawanda, Ilion and Syracuse in New York; in Middletown, Connecticut; and in Marietta and Norwood in Ohio.Rodden, The Fighting Machinists: A Century of Struggle, 1984.Stolberg, The Story of the CIO, 1938. James Rand, Jr., president of Remington Rand, refused to bargain with the union. On May 8, 1934, 6,500 workers struck to force the company to recognize the union and sign a collective bargaining agreement. On June 18, 1936, the firm recognized the union and signed a contract which provided wage increases and established a grievance procedure. Remington Rand, however, continued a policy of harassment and obstruction toward the union. It often violated the contract in small ways (forcing the union to file time-consuming and costly grievances), harassed union leaders, and generally contested the union at every turn.\\"'Medieval, Shocking,' \\" Time, March 22, 1937. In February 1936, the District Council of Office Equipment Workers became the Remington Rand Joint Protective Board. Beginning of the strike Worker anger had built high by May 1936, when the company spread rumors that its plants were being bought by an unknown firm that would no longer recognize the union. Remington Rand then announced it had purchased a typewriter plant in nearby Elmira and might close the Tonawanda and Syracuse facilities. The union demanded information on possible plant closures, which the company refused. The union then threatened a strike. In retaliation, the company distributed its own strike ballots and claimed that it alone could speak for workers. Outraged union officials seized and destroyed the company's ballots, interrupted and broke up meetings at which ballots were handed out, and harassed and physically intimidated managers trying to conduct balloting.\\"Syracuse Shop Shut by Remington Rand,\\" Associated Press, May 22, 1936.\\"Rand Reshuffle,\\" Time, June 22, 1936.Remington Rand, Inc., 2 NLRB 626 (decided March 13, 1937). The Joint Board quickly held its own strike vote. More than 75% of the union's members voted to strike. Union officials asked the company to submit the dispute to a federal mediator, but the company refused to do so. Instead, Remington Rand fired the presidents of the local unions in Tonawanda and Syracuse along with fifteen other union activists. Infuriated workers in Ilion, Syracuse and Tonawanda walked off their jobs on May 25, 1936, followed by Remington Rand workers in Ohio and Connecticut the following day.\\"Strike in 6 Plants of Remington Rand,\\" New York Times, May 26, 1936.\\"Six Rand Factories Guarded in Strike,\\" New York Times, May 27, 1936. Violence during the strike The Remington Rand strike was a particularly violent strike. Although no one died during the strike, both sides engaged in beatings with fists and clubs, rock and brick throwing, vandalism, threats and physical intimidation. But historians and federal officials point out that the company went out of its way to antagonize workers and use private security personnel (sometimes disguised as workers) to instigate violence and riots. The record before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the scholarly literature show that the level of violence in the strike was deliberately manipulated by Remington Rand, and was several orders of magnitude higher than it would have been had the company not taken the actions it did.\\"'Whispering' Used to Break Ranks,\\" New York Times. November 25, 1936. Notable incidents include: *In mid-June 1936, the company sent 100 strikebreakers through the picket line toward the front gate of the plant in Tonawanda. The company deliberately withdrew its protection of the workers when they reached the picket line. A fight broke out between the strikebreakers and the 500 picketers. Tonawanda police, waiting nearby, descended on the picketers and beat hundreds with billy-clubs. *Beginning July 3, 1936, a four-day running riot began around the Middletown, Ohio, plant. The riot began when the company attempted to bring hundreds of strikebreakers through the picket lines unprotected. Over the following two days, workers hurled stones at strikebreakers, keeping them from entering the plant. When the company attempted to bring the workers in on buses on July 7, workers seized and boarded the buses, then forced the strikebreakers off the buses. Two were parked at the plant gates and torn apart. A third was chased by police through the streets of the town, only to crash on the lawn in front of City Hall.\\"Half Dozen Beaten in Rand Strike Riot,\\" Associated Press, July 4, 1936; \\"Workers Stoned in Ohio Rand Strike,\\" Associated Press, July 7, 1936.\\"3 Buses Wrecked by Rand Strikers,\\" Associated Press, July 8, 1936; \\"Deadlock Persists in Ohio,\\" Associated Press, July 12, 1936. *On July 24, 1936, striking workers threw home-made bombs at plants in Middletown and Syracuse, injuring one policeman. The bombs did only minor damage.\\"Policeman Hurt By Strike Bomb at Rand Plant,\\" United Press International, July 25, 1936. *On August 12, 1936, Syracuse police shot and injured two strikers, leading the governor of the state to threaten to bring in the National Guard unless local authorities showed more restraint.\\"2 Shot in Rand Strike,\\" Associated Press, August 13, 1936. *On August 22, 1936, striking workers at the Middletown plant hurled large iron balls at police, injuring four.\\"4 Hurt in Rioting at Rand Factory,\\" Associated Press, August 23, 1936. Strike tactics The Remington Rand strike is notable for the wide array of aggressive anti-union tactics employed by the employer. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) documented these tactics in a 120-page decision, Remington Rand, Inc., 2 NLRB 626 (decided March 13, 1937). The tactics used were not merely inventive (although some had been used by employers before), but, as the NLRB argued, were specifically designed and utilized to undermine the democratic process, manipulate public opinion through deceit and terror, and violate federal law. =Plant closures= With the union out on strike, Remington Rand quickly began consolidating its plants. The company later admitted that it had long wanted to close several of its plants, but that the union was too strong and would not have permitted it. Remington Rand contracted with millwrights several months before the strike began (discussions which courts and federal agencies later interpreted as a sign of the company's bad-faith bargaining) to dismantle the plants. Within days of the strike's commencement, Remington Rand contractors began crating plant machinery in Middletown, Syracuse and Tonawanda. Workers tried blocking the millwrights and trucks from entering and leaving the plant but were mostly unsuccessful. Strikers subsequently pelted trucks with stones, bricks and bottles, or laid iron spikes in the roadway to puncture the tires of trucks.\\"Remington Rand Moves Machines,\\" New York Times, June 5, 1936.\\"Rand Acquitted of Strikebreaking,\\" New York Times, November 19, 1937. Misleading information about plant closures was also common. When the strike began, the mayor of Syracuse met with Rand and won Rand's personal reassurance that the company would not close the plant. But Rand planned exactly that, and his lie was designed to win backing of city officials for the company's anti-union campaign. The company also often placed \\"For Sale\\" signs in front of factories or announced their closing in advertisements. In some cases, the company went so far as to hire private security guards to pose as millwrights to support its claim that it was closing plants.Smith, From Blackjacks to Briefcases, 2003. Announcements of plant closures were designed to demoralize striking union members and frighten workers who had remained on the job into staying. They also were used to terrorize local citizens who feared for the economic life of their towns. Often, company officials would later make statements suggesting that the plant would stay open if the union gave up the strike, statements which encouraged local citizens to put intense emotional, political and economic pressure on the union.\\"U.S. Board Orders Remington Rand to Re-Employ 4,000,\\" New York Times, March 15, 1937.\\"Threatens to Close a Remington Plant.\\" Associated Press, June 13, 1936; \\"Remington Rand Drops 3 Plants,\\" Associated Press, June 14, 1936. =Use of private security forces= Remington Rand also hired very large numbers of private security forces to protect its property and attempt to re-open some facilities. The company had engaged in extensive pre-strike planning with \\"detective agencies\\" (a euphemism for private security guard companies) in all its locations. In discussions with these firms, the company clearly conveyed the attitude that it had every intention of provoking a strike in order to break the union, and would not engage in good-faith bargaining. One company which provided private security forces, led by Pearl Bergoff, received $25,850.\\"Rand, Bergoff and Chowderhead,\\" Time, December 7, 1936. Remington Rand claimed it had to hire its own private police forces to protect its property and the strikebreakers. But the union and local officials argued that Remington Rand's real goal was to foment trouble. As Middletown Mayor Leo Santangelo pointed out: \\"There were more policemen outside than there were men wanting to come in.\\" =Support of local law enforcement= Remington Rand also relied heavily on local police and specially-sworn county sheriff's deputies to provide protection. Several months before the strike began, the company informed local officials that it intended to provoke the union and would need the cooperation of local officials. Many enthusiastically did so, believing that the company would close its plants (harming the city's tax base) if they did not. In Syracuse, for example, the mayor gave the company unlimited police protection. Where local officials resisted the company's request for help, Remington Rand intimidated them into offering assistance. The mayor of Ilion later admitted that he was forced to provide police protection: His own personal banker had threatened to call in his loans and delete his personal and business lines of credit, and a \\"citizens' committee\\" formed by the company threatened to institute a boycott against his business and a slander campaign against him personally if he did not cooperate.\\"Police Will Protect Remington Workers,\\" New York Times, May 28, 1936.\\"Syracuse Rand Plant Guarded,\\" Associated Press, January 2, 1937; \\"Fear of 'Trouble' Attributed to Rand,\\" Associated Press, November 9, 1937. Local law enforcement personnel played a particularly important role in terrorizing the population of Ilion and turning public opinion against the union. Remington Rand paid Herkimer County to deputize 300 special sheriff's deputies to provide protection for company and town property. Remington Rand armed the deputies with Remington handguns and billy- clubs, and bought civilian automobiles to serve as squad cars. While these deputies and the town police remained under the control of their respective governmental authorities, the company worked closely with county and town officials to heighten tensions within the town. Squads of six sheriff's deputies and one police officer were armed with shotguns and stationed at every road and path leading into the town. Local citizens had to obtain passes from the Remington Rand company to enter the town. Later, company officials disingenuously accused local police of using kid gloves on strikers, which gave local police the political cover they needed to increase the level of violence aimed at picketers.\\"Urges Police Club Syracuse Rioters,\\" Associated Press, June 12, 1936.\\"Union 'Expose' Used in Breaking Strike,\\" New York Times, November 26, 1936. =Use of strikebreakers= Remington Rand also fired all striking workers and replaced them with permanent replacements. Initially, few replacement workers were willing to take the company up on its offer. The union ringed each plant with thousands of workers, family members and supporters, and few replacement employees were willing to run the gauntlet of angry, sometimes violent union members. Others feared reprisals against them and their families if they took work at the plant. At first, Remington Rand gave security guards a $5 a day bonus if they successfully made it past the picketers and into the plant, where they pretended to be workers.\\"Incited Violence, Strike Guards Say,\\" Associated Press, September 24, 1936. But the company soon began offering large bonuses for replacement workers, and in the depths of the Great Depression few people could afford to turn down work.\\"Offers Bonus for 800 Workers,\\" New York Times, June 6, 1936. =Misinformation= Remington Rand also made a significant number of false and misleading statements designed to mislead the media, demoralize strikers and reassure investors. Sixteen days into the strike, for example, company president James Rand announced an end to the strike at all six plants, a statement which roiled the union and led hundreds of workers to mistakenly accuse elected union leaders of selling out. In fact, no agreement had been reached.\\"Rand is Optimistic on Strike Trends,\\" New York Times. June 11, 1936. Two weeks later, Remington Rand announced that workers in Ohio had returned to work under a new collective bargaining agreement which offered highly favorable terms. The announcement demoralized workers in New York and Connecticut, and raised suspicions about the competence and reliability of union leaders. The truth was that only 21 of the 911 workers at the plant had accepted these terms, and they had not supported the strike.\\"Rand Plant Reopens,\\" Associated Press, June 30, 1936. A few days later, Remington Rand officials falsely claimed that 5,300 of the company's workers had crossed picket lines and were back at work.\\"Rand Pickets Curbed,\\" Associated Press, July 19, 1936. In Tonawanda, the company planted a rumor among the picketers that several union members were returning to work. The company then hired 85 security guards to impersonate these \\"returning workers,\\" and armed them with bricks and clubs. When a pitched battle broke out between the impersonators and picketers, company photographers took pictures of the near-riot. The company shipped the security guards out of town that night and turned the photos over to the local newspapers‚Äîwhich duly printed them as \\"proof\\" that \\"labor goons\\" had attacked \\"honest working men.\\" The corporation then used this incident to manipulate a state court into imposing a temporary injunction against the strikers. Misinformation was also used to frighten local citizens and manipulate public opinion. For example, on June 9, 1936, Remington Rand announced that it had employed 500 strikebreakers to resume production at its plant in Syracuse. In fact, the company had hired no replacement workers at all. Working behind the scenes with the company, the local police then announced a major increase in the number of police protecting the Remington Rand plant.\\"Hiring 500 to End Syracuse Strike.\\" Associated Press. June 10, 1936. When violence died down in Ohio, President Rand announced he would \\"hire 1,000 men if necessary\\" to protect the plant. Angry union members reinforced their pickets, and when Rand attempted to bring even a small number of guards to the plant they were pelted with stones‚Äîleading to the violence Rand had claimed already existed.\\"Rand to Guard Plant,\\" Associated Press, August 18, 1936. =Other tactics= The Remington Rand company also worked with local courts to influence the outcome of the strike. The company used relationships and ex parte communications with judges prior to the strike to ensure that strikers would be dealt with harshly, although the number of these cases appears to be limited. In Syracuse, for example, two teenaged girls were sentenced to 30 days in jail for merely waving a rubber rat at replacement workers. In Middletown, local judges handed down six-month prison sentences to a large number of picketers based solely on the testimony of two Remington Rand security guards. In many cases, however, the company manipulated events to ensure that law-and-order judges would impose the maximum sentence or the outcome the company desired. Remington Rand often incited picketers to riot. Working with local law enforcement officials, the company would then present evidence in court implicating workers but not management. This manipulation of the judicial system often led judges to severely restrict union picketing near company property. In New York, for example, a federal judge limited picketing to only four workers at a time, and all workers had to wear a large badge identifying themselves as such. (Nearly two years later, federal investigations exposed the company-law enforcement collusion.)\\"Hear Rand Strike Charge,\\" Associated Press, July 1, 1936. Remington Rand also formed \\"citizens' committees\\" controlled by the company to put additional pressure on the union. Federal investigators later found that these citizens' committees were founded and funded by the company, and used to intimidate businessmen, banks and others into withdrawing support from or opposing the striking workers. In New York, for example, landlords raised the rent of strikers to put pressure on them to return to work. Citizens' committees also put political pressure on local elected officials, bringing local and county law enforcement under the control of the firm. In Ohio, local officials order law enforcement personnel to padlock and seal local union offices after minor pretextual complaints by company officials. In Elmira, the mayor ordered the police to ban circulation of the local labor newspaper. Citizens' committees were also used to secretly manipulate public opinion against the union and its members. Unaware of the true nature of these committees, the media often reported their demands for an end to the strike or denunciations of union \\"violence\\" ‚Äì which encouraged the public to turn against the strikers.Silverberg, \\"Citizens' Committees: Their Role in Industrial Conflict,\\" Public Opinion Quarterly, March 1941. Remington Rand also engaged in threats and intimidation. The company hired at least 80 men and women to pose as religious missionaries, and had these individuals visit strikers' homes. Once in the home, the \\"missionary\\" would harangue the family and demand that the breadwinner return to work. In other cases, groups of company employees posing as \\"concerned citizens\\" would mass in front of strikers' homes and demand that the worker abandon the picket line, leave town, or return to work. These activities were often coordinated with company back-to- work campaigns and reinforced by mistaken media reports of large numbers of picket-line crossings. Events during the strike Largely unprepared for the strike, the union was able to win at least one early battle against Remington Rand. The Democratic Governor of the state of New York, Herbert H. Lehman, refused to allow the New York State Police to intervene in the strike, despite the company's demands.\\"Lehman Bars State Police in the Rand Strike,\\" New York Times, June 6, 1936. Remington Rand began its misinformation campaign immediately. In mid-June, Remington Rand threatened to close its plants in Middletown, Norwood, Syracuse, and Tonawanda unless workers returned to work immediately. Politicians pleaded with union officials to end the strike. A few days later, Remington Rand announced (incorrectly) that union leaders in Ohio had accepted an offer to return to work. The announcement created deep divisions between leaders and members in the union, and between union chapters in the various plants. However, only 21 workers out of 911 had accepted the offer, and most of those had not been union members. On July 6, the union held a mass demonstration in Syracuse in support of workers in Ohio who had rioted over the previous days. Despite the size of the Syracuse riot, company officials declared the strike \\"definitely broken.\\"\\"Demonstration at Syracuse.\\" Associated Press. July 7, 1936. On July 18, a federal judge significantly restricted union picketing at Remington Rand's plants in New York. The union was limited to only four picketing workers at a time, and all picketers had to wear large badges identifying themselves as union members. Federal officials later determined that the violence which led the court to impose the injunction had been instigated by Remington Rand. On July 22, Governor Wilbur L. Cross of Connecticut asked Governor Martin L. Davey of Ohio and Governor Lehman of New York to meet with him and Rand's president to discuss an end to the strike. Despite interest from the governors and union, Cross abandoned his plan for a tri-state arbitration committee after a spate of violence at Remington Rand plants and receiving a host of pre-conditions from Rand himself.\\"Governor Asks Typewriter Co. Strike Parley,\\" United Press International, July 23, 1936; \\"Asks Rand Strike Parley,\\" Associated Press, July 23, 1936; \\"Lehman Backs Cross in Rand Peace Move,\\" New York Times, July 24, 1936; \\"New Violence Marks Strike in Rand Plants,\\" Associated Press, July 25, 1936. The union won a few skirmishes in the strike in August 1936. New York Governor Lehman ordered a special session of the appellate division of the New York Supreme Court to hear an emergency appeal of a state court ruling granting an injunction against the union under the State Anti-Injunction Law of 1935. The appeal was ultimately unsuccessful.\\"Lehman Summons Court in Rand Case,\\" New York Times, August 1, 1936; \\"Rand Strike Writ Upheld on Appeal,\\" New York Times, August 19, 1936. After a fresh outbreak of violence in Syracuse on August 11, in which two strikers were shot and injured by local police, Governor Lehman threatened to replace policemen with National Guard troops unless local law enforcement authorities proved capable of more restraint. Contract talks begin in earnest in late July 1936, three months into the strike. The AFL had filed a variety of unfair labor practice (ULPs) charges against Remington Rand, but the company had won a temporary injunction halting any NLRB hearings on the ULPs in mid-July. Remington Rand officials were particularly concerned that NLRB hearings would expose their anti-union tactics. Company officials, worried that the United States Supreme Court and other federal courts would uphold the National Labor Relations Act, began negotiations as a fall-back strategy. Those negotiations collapsed on September 2, 1936.\\"Rand Strike Talks End,\\" Associated Press, September 3, 1936. A major turning point in the strike came 10 days later. U.S. district court Judge John Knight lifted the temporary injunction and ordered the NLRB to proceed with its ULP hearings.\\"Rand Concern Loses Plea for Injunction,\\" Associated Press, September 13, 1936. The NLRB hearings, as well as United States Senate hearings into strikebreaking in general, began in late September. Evidence of the extensive anti-union campaign in the Remington Rand strike became public in late November 1936, and made national headlines.Strikebreaking Services, S. Report 6, Part I, Committee on Education and Labor, U.S. Senate, 1939. By March 1937, public exposure of the Remington Rand company's anti-union efforts had led to a significant deterioration in the firm's public support. The company did not cut back on its efforts, and rumor-mongering about plant closures and to demoralize workers was still effective. But public opinion and media opinion proved much harder to manipulate, and many elected officials were quietly withdrawing support for the company. On March 11, 1937, United States Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins attempted to mediate an end to the strike. When Perkins attempted to reach Rand by telephone, his aides claimed to not know where he was. When Perkins sent him telegrams and letters, company staff said they did not know how to reach him. Perkins was forced to publish an open letter in newspapers in Connecticut, New York and Ohio, asking Rand to speak to her. He did so the next day, but refused to discuss the strike with her. The incident embarrassed and angered Perkins, but Rand's rudeness further eroded the company's public standing.\\"Miss Perkins Writes Open Letter to Rand,\\" Associated Press, March 12, 1937. On March 13, 1937, the NLRB issued a decision finding Remington Rand guilty of violating federal labor law. The decision, Remington Rand, Inc., 2 NLRB 626, was an astonishing 120-page decision in which the Board recounted nearly every anti-union tactic the company had undertaken in the last year. The Board accused Rand of putting himself above the law and wantonly violating the National Labor Relations Act. The Board's discussion of Remington Rand's actions was cast in moral terms. Although many of the actions were not necessarily illegal, the Board was deeply distressed that the company and its president would engage in behavior which, in the Board's view, constituted open economic and class warfare. The NLRB ordered Remington Rand to reinstate, with back pay, the union members who had been discharged, to reinstate all workers still on strike, to dismantle its company unions, and recognize the union in its six existing plants as well as the new plant in Elmira. Rand refused to obey the NLRB order. Instead, the same day that the Board issued its opinion, he agreed to meet with Perkins and discuss the strike.\\"Rand to Discuss Strike,\\" Associated Press, March 13, 1937; \\"Remington Rand Defies U.S. Board,\\" New York Times, March 16, 1937. The NLRB's ruling, however, placed the company in a difficult legal position, and Remington Rand quickly reached an agreement with the union after a short session mediated by Perkins. Terms of the agreement were not released for a month.\\"Approve Rand Peace Plan,\\" New York Times, April 21, 1937; \\"Strikers Approve Rand Peace Terms,\\" New York Times, April 22, 1937. The NLRB immediately sought a federal court ruling ordering Remington Rand to obey its orders.\\"Rand Case Taken to Court by NLRB,\\" Associated Press, March 18, 1937. Remington Rand's position in the strike worsened when a federal grand jury indicted James Rand, Jr., and Pearl Bergoff, owner of Bergoff Industrial Service (a strikebreaking \\"detective agency\\"), of violating the Byrnes Act, a federal law enacted in 1936 which forbade the interstate transportation of strikebreakers.\\"Grand Jury to Hear Remington-Rand Case,\\" Associated Press, April 11, 1937; \\"Rand and Bergoff Indicted by Federal Jury For Putting Strike-Breakers in Middletown,\\" New York Times, April 13, 1937. On April 21, 1937, union members approved a settlement with Remington Rand permitting all workers to return to their jobs. Initially, some workers refused to agree to the pact, but a month's lobbying by the AFL led to overwhelming passage.\\"Strike Peace Delayed.\\" New York Times. March 21, 1937; \\"Rehiring Is Ordered By Remington Rand,\\" New York Times, April 20, 1937. Rand and Bergoff were acquitted of violating the Byrnes Act on November 18, 1937.Shaplen, \\"Rand Acquitted of Strikebreaking,\\" New York Times, November 19, 1937. Remington Rand, however, continued to resist the NLRB's order. But on February 14, 1938, Judge Learned Hand, writing for a unanimous court, ruled in National Labor Relations Board v. Remington Rand, Inc. 94 F.2d 862 (1938), that the company must obey the terms of the NLRB's decision.\\"Federal Court Denies Writ to Labor Board Against Remington-Rand in Labor Row,\\" Associated Press, July 1, 1937; \\"Court Tells Rand to Recognize A.F.L.,\\" Associated Press, February 15, 1938. Remington Rand appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to grant certiorari, thereby upholding the appellate court's ruling.Remington Rand v. National Labor Relations Board, cert denied, 304 U.S. 576 (1938); \\"Remington Rand Appeals,\\" Associated Press, April 17, 1938; \\"6,000 in Rand Units Strike Over Court,\\" Associated Press, June 2, 1938. Remington Rand began slowly furloughing strikebreakers after the Supreme Court's refusal to hear its case.\\"Remington Rand Warned By Court,\\" Associated Press, June 5, 1938; \\"Rand to Oust 800, Rehire Strikers,\\" Associated Press, June 9, 1938. Aftermath of the strike Another two years would pass before the NLRB's order in Remington Rand, Inc. would be fully implemented. During the strike, Remington Rand had established company unions at all its plants. Now the AFL and these company unions battled one another to represent the workers at the firm. In late June 1938, the company union demanded an immediate NLRB election to determine whether employees should continue to have a union or not. The AFL argued that no election was appropriate until all striking workers had been rehired. The two sides battled repeatedly over the election issue, and in October 1938 announced an agreement.\\"Ask Rand Vote at Once,\\" Associated Press, June 26, 1938; \\"Rand Peace Reported,\\" Associated Press, October 11, 1938. Remington Rand refused to implement the terms of the agreement, however. In August 1939 the company union again petitioned the NLRB to hold elections to determine whether employees wished to have a union or not. The union filed a series of ULPs in September and October, leading to another round of NLRB hearings. The situation deteriorated so badly that union members in Tonawanda struck in early April 1940. The strike spread and violence quickly broke out. Unwilling to undergo another large strike, Remington Rand agreed to dismantle its company unions on April 8, 1940.\\"NLRB Vote Is Asked By Remington Rand,\\" Associated Press, August 8, 1939; \\"Stay Asked Against NLRB,\\" Associated Press, October 3, 1939; \\"Rand Offers Labor Peace,\\" Associated Press, March 29, 1940; \\"Rand Strike Spreads,\\" Associated Press, April 6, 1940; \\"Rand-A.F.L.

Despite the series of agreements with the AFL and the NLRB, Remington Rand continued to resist implementing the court's order. On June 4, 1940, the NLRB filed suit against the company seeking to have it declared in contempt of court. Remington Rand had enough, and on June 30, 1940, agreed to dismantle its company unions and recognize the AFL.\\"Rand Plant Shut,\\" Associated Press, June 5, 1940; \\"Remington Rand, Inc., Bows to NLRB Order,\\" New York Times, June 30, 1940. The \\"Mohawk Valley formula\\" The June 1936 issue of the NAM's Labor Relations Bulletin immortalized the \\"Mohawk Valley formula\\" as a classic blueprint for union busting. The nine-point formula, as devised by James Rand, Jr., is as follows:As quoted in Rodden, The Fighting Machinists: A Century of Struggle, 1984. # When a strike is threatened, label the union leaders as \\"agitators\\" to discredit them with the public and their own followers. Conduct balloting under the foremen to ascertain the strength of the union and to make possible misrepresentation of the strikers as a small minority. Exert economic pressure through threats to move the plant, align bankers, real estate owners and businessmen into a \\"Citizens' Committee.\\" # Raise high the banner of \\"law and order\\", thereby causing the community to mass legal and police weapons against imagined violence and to forget that employees have equal right with others in the community. # Call a \\"mass meeting\\" to coordinate public sentiment against the strike and strengthen the Citizens' Committee. # Form a large police force to intimidate the strikers and exert a psychological effect. Utilize local police, state police, vigilantes and special deputies chosen, if possible, from other neighborhoods. # Convince the strikers their cause is hopeless with a \\"back-to-work\\" movement by a puppet association of so-called \\"loyal employees\\" secretly organized by the employer. # When enough applications are on hand, set a date for opening the plant by having such opening requested by the puppet \\"back-to-work\\" association. # Stage the \\"opening\\" theatrically by throwing open the gates and having the employees march in a mass protected by squads of armed police so as to dramatize and exaggerate the opening and heighten the demoralizing effect. # Demoralize the strikers with a continuing show of force. If necessary turn the locality into a warlike camp and barricade it from the outside world. # Close the publicity barrage on the theme that the plant is in full operation and the strikers are merely a minority attempting to interfere with the \\"right to work\\". With this, the campaign is over‚Äîthe employer has broken the strike. Notes References *\\"Approve Rand Peace Plan.\\" New York Times. April 21, 1937. *\\"Ask Rand Vote at Once.\\" Associated Press.

After his playing days were over, he embarked upon a second career as a football coach, starting in high school, then college, and finally back in the National Football League with the Houston Oilers / Tennessee Titans, the Washington Redskins, and the Seattle Seahawks. Early years Smith played quarterback of the North High School football team in his native Youngstown, Ohio. After graduation, he attended Miami University in Ohio, playing the same position and leading the Redhawks to the Mid-American Conference title in each of his last three seasons, with a stellar record of 33-1-1. He is a cousin of former NFL tight end Mike Cobb, whose playing career at Michigan State overlapped with Smith's at Miami. Their respective teams faced each other in the 1975 season, with Michigan State winning 14-13 which was Miami's only regular season loss that year. Professional playing career Smith was drafted in the second round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks as a running back. As a Seahawk, Smith was called \\"The Tank\\" in reference to the Sherman Tank because of his performance to run through tackles. He was the first offensive player picked by the new expansion team in its first season. He was the first Seahawk to rush for over 100 yards in a game when he ran for 124 yards against the Atlanta Falcons on November 7, 1976. https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197611070sea.htm Smith led the team in rushing in his first four seasons, eventually amassing 3,429 yards and 28 touchdowns in his seven years with the team. He also caught the ball 210 times for a total of 2,445 yards and 10 touchdowns. He played sparingly for the San Diego Chargers in the 1983 season. Coaching career The following year, Smith began teaching and coaching at Redmond Junior High School, then at Redmond High School in the state of Washington. He became the running back coach at Miami University, his alma mater, in 1990. Between 1992 and 1994, he worked as the tight end and running back coach at the University of Illinois. In 1995, Smith joined the staff of the Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans) as running back coach, where he helped mold Eddie George into one of the league's elite running backs. The organization promoted Smith in 2006, giving him the title of assistant head coach in addition to his continuing duties as running back coach. In 2008, Smith left the Titans to join the Washington Redskins as offensive coordinator, reuniting with his former Seahawks teammate, Jim Zorn, who had been named head coach of the Redskins. After the 2009 season, Zorn was fired and Mike Shanahan was named as the new head coach in Washington. Smith was not retained on staff by Shanahan. Shortly thereafter Smith was reunited with his former team, the Seattle Seahawks, when hired as a position coach (running backs). As of February 17, 2017 Smith was no longer with Seattle Seahawks due to a change to the position made by the head coach Pete Carroll. Personal life Smith's children are Shavonne, Sherman and Deland. Deland is Kansas City Chiefs running backs coach Deland McCullough. The two had known each other since Smith was recruiting McCullough to the RedHawks when the latter was 17, but only learned they were related in 2017.http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/24505521/the-jaw- dropping-story-nfl-coach-search-family His brother was former CFL All-Star Darrell K.

He made two important and celebrated attempts to climb the mountain K2 in the Karakoram Range. Early life and education Houston was born in New York in 1913 and grew up in Great Neck on Long Island. He was educated at The Hotchkiss School and Harvard University, and he earned a Doctor of Medicine from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Mountaineering Houston began climbing in the Alps with his father where they met Scottish mountaineer T. Graham Brown. He then gained experience on several expeditions to Canada and America making the second ascent of Mount Foraker in 1934, with T. Graham Brown and Chychele Waterston. In 1936, Houston was a member of the British‚ÄìAmerican Himalayan Expedition led by the British climber H.W. Tilman to the top of Nanda Devi in India, the highest mountain climbed at that time. In 1938, he was the leader of the first American Karakoram expedition to K2. Although he did not reach the summit, his party mapped a route to the top that was later used by the Italian team that first summited the mountain in 1954. In 1950 Houston and Tilman led a trekking expedition to the Khumbu Glacier, just west of Mount Everest. They were the first Westerners to get there (and amongst the first mountaineers to be allowed into Nepal). They examined the Khumbu Icefall to see whether it provided a means of climbing Everest and were the first observers of the higher parts of Everest from Khumbu \\\\- the route subsequently taken by Sir Edmund Hillary in Everest's first successful ascent. He attempted K2 again in 1953 (see Third American Karakoram Expedition). A member of the team, Art Gilkey, became ill (probably with thrombophlebitis) as they approached the summit. The team reversed direction and tried to carry Gilkey down. However, he was lost in a disastrous cascade of events precipitated by a fall where upon multiple ropes became entangled, resulting in most of the team sliding out of control roped together down the mountain. When the last roped man, Pete Schoening, was about to be plucked off by the accelerating climbers, he was remarkably able to arrest the fall of all six climbers using an ice axe belay. \\"The Belay\\" was one of the most famous events in mountaineering history. After the 1953 K2 expedition, Houston (then age 40) never participated on any further technical climbs. Medical practice and teaching Houston practiced internal medicine in Exeter, New Hampshire and Aspen, Colorado. Later, he joined the faculty at the University of Vermont as Professor of Medicine. He retired from the faculty in 1979. Medical research Houston began his study of the effects of high altitude as a naval flight surgeon in World War II. He was in charge of Operation Everest (1947) in which four subjects were taken to a simulated altitude of 8850 m over 34 days in a compression chamber. These studies demonstrated that careful acclimatization would allow pilots to fly unpressurized planes to altitudes of 15,000 feet and higher. This capacity afforded the US Army Air Force an important tactical advantage. He was among the first to study High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (1958), and High Altitude Retinal Hemorrhage (1968). He authored numerous books and articles about mountain medicine. Starting in 1975, he organized the International Hypoxia Symposia in the Canadian Rockies. In 1996 he was awarded the King Albert Medal of Merit to honor his \\"singular achievements\\" in the mountain world . Houston was also involved with early attempts to construct an artificial heart. Although not successful, his design was influential in later developments, including the Jarvik-7 model that was used with some success. Peace Corps service From 1962 to 1965, Houston served as the first Country Director of the Peace Corps for India. During his tenure, the volunteers in India grew from 6 to 250. He was instrumental in developing a doctors' division within the Corps. Works by Charles S. Houston References External links *Charles Houston Papers MSS 716.

He was the youngest of Jesse and Lula Hatcher's four children. His father was an ex‚Äëconvict and an abusive alcoholic. Hatcher was bullied in school, and in turn bullied his classmates and would carry this practice into adulthood.Encyclopedia of Serial Killers p. 216 In the spring of 1935, he and his older brothers were flying a kite with copper wire they had found in an old ModelT Ford. His oldest brother, Arthur Allen, was about to hand the kite to him when it hit a high‚Äëvoltage power line and electrocuted him. Arthur was pronounced dead at the scene. Soon afterward, his father left home and divorced his mother. His mother remarried several times, and in 1945, Hatcher moved with his mother and her third husband to St.Joseph. Crimes =1947‚Äì1963= In 1947, Hatcher was convicted of auto theft in St.Joseph after stealing a logging truck from Iowa‚ÄìMissouri Walnut Company, his employer of two weeks. He received a two‚Äëyear suspended sentence. In 1948, he was convicted of auto theft a second time for stealing a 1937 Buick in St.Joseph. Hatcher was sentenced to two years in the Missouri State Penitentiary. On June 8, 1949, Hatcher was released from prison after serving a little more than half of his time. He was back in prison in just a few months, after being convicted of forging a $10 check at a gas station in Maryville, Missouri. On March 18, 1951, Hatcher escaped from prison and attempted a burglary. He was caught and received an extra two years in prison. After serving his additional time, Hatcher was released from prison on July 14, 1954. He stole a 1951 Ford in Orrick and was subsequently sentenced to four years in prison. Before he was sentenced, Hatcher attempted to escape from the Ray County Jail in Richmond and received an additional two years. On March 18, 1959, Hatcher was released from prison after the sixth prison sentence of his life. On June 26, 1959, Hatcher attempted to abduct Steven Pellham, a 16‚Äëyear‚Äëold in St.Joseph who delivered newspapers, threatening him with a butcher knife. Pellham reported the crime, and Hatcher was arrested when the police stopped him in a stolen vehicle. Hatcher was sentenced to five years in the Missouri State Penitentiary for the attempted abduction and auto theft under the Habitual Criminal Act. While Hatcher was waiting to be transported to prison, he unsuccessfully attempted to break out of the Buchanan County Jail. When Hatcher arrived at the Missouri State Penitentiary, he claimed to be the most notorious criminal in northwest Missouri since Jesse James. On July 2, 1961, a 26-year-old inmate named Jerry Tharrington was found raped and stabbed to death on the floor of the prison kitchen loading dock.The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers p. 216 He had been repeatedly stabbed in the back. Hatcher was the only individual missing from the kitchen crew at the time of the murder. He was sent to solitary confinement for Tharrington‚Äôs murder, but there was not enough evidence to convict him in court. While in solitary confinement for the murder, Hatcher wrote a note claiming that he needed psychiatric treatment; however, the prison psychologist felt that it was simply a scheme to get out of solitary and possibly out of prison early. Treatment was refused, and Hatcher was returned to the general population. His sentence was reduced to three‚Äëquarters the original time, and he was released on August 24, 1963. =1969‚Äì1977= Hatcher confessed to abducting a 12‚Äëyear‚Äëold named William Freeman in Antioch, California on August 27, 1969. He claimed he had told the boy to come with him, took him to a creek, and strangled him. On August 29, 1969, six‚Äëyear‚Äëold Gilbert Martinez was reported missing in San Francisco. According to the six‚Äëyear‚Äëold girl with whom he was playing, Martinez walked away with a man who offered him ice cream. He was found by a man walking his dog as the boy was being beaten and sexually assaulted. Police arrived and arrested the assailant, who identified himself as Albert Ralph Price, although he carried identification with the name Hobert Prater. Martinez survived the assault, and Federal Bureau of Investigation records later identified the man as Charles R. Hatcher. Still going by the name Albert Price, Hatcher was charged with assault with attempt to commit sodomy and kidnapping. He was ordered to undergo competency evaluations to determine his competence to stand trial. A complete psychological evaluation was ordered when Hatcher was unresponsive during the preliminary evaluations. During this time, he claimed to hear voices, and faked delusions and suicide attempts to avoid prison. In December 1970, Hatcher was sent back and forth between the courts and hospital multiple times. One psychiatrist diagnosed him as having a passive‚Äìaggressive personality with paraphilia and pedophilia. It was reported that the hospital staff felt Hatcher was fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of his mental disorders. He was examined by two psychiatrists in January 1971. He was declared insane by the first one, who recommended vigorous treatment in a secure hospital. The second psychiatrist declared him to be incompetent to stand trial and sent him back to the hospital. On May 24, 1971, Hatcher was sent to trial and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. He was sent to a different hospital for more evaluations, where it was determined that he was unfit to stand trial. On June 2, Hatcher escaped from the hospital. He was caught a week later in Colusa, California and arrested for suspected auto theft under the name Richard Lee Grady. Hatcher was returned to the California State Hospital for a mental evaluation. In April 1972, hospital staff determined that his treatment was unsuccessful and that he was a danger to other patients, after which he was sent to the prison state hospital in Vacaville. In August 1972, Hatcher was transferred to San Quentin State Prison to stand trial, three years after the crime. He was ordered to undergo two final examinations: one declared him competent to stand trial and the other determined him to be sane at the time of the crime. In December 1972, Hatcher was tried for, and convicted of the abduction and molestation of Martinez. In January 1972, he was committed to the California State Hospital as a \\"mentally disordered sexual offender\\". On March 28, 1973, security guards found Hatcher hiding in a cooler near the hospital's main courtyard with two sheets stuffed into his pants, after which he admitted to an escape attempt. He was sent back to court for sentencing after doctors determined he was still a threat to society. In April, Hatcher was sentenced to one year to life and sent to a medium‚Äësecurity prison in Vacaville. In May 1973, a psychologist found Hatcher to be a \\"manipulative institutionalized sociopath\\". In June 1973, he attempted suicide by slashing his wrists after it was recommended that he be transferred to a maximum security prison. A psychiatrist diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia, and he remained at Vacaville. In August 1975, guards reported good behavior at Hatcher's parole review. In June 1976, the California Parole Board found that Hatcher had improved dramatically through his time in prison and set a parole date of December 25, 1978. As a result of the passage of a bill giving inmates credit for time spent in jails and mental hospitals, Hatcher received a modified parole date in January 1977. He was released to a halfway house in San Francisco on May 20, 1977. =1978‚Äì1982= On September 4, 1978, Hatcher was arrested under the name Richard Clark in Omaha, Nebraska for sexually assaulting a 16‚Äëyear‚Äëold boy. He was sent to the Douglas County Mental Hospital and released in January 1979. On May 3, 1979, Hatcher was arrested for assault and attempted murder after he tried to stab seven‚Äëyear‚Äëold Thomas Morton. He was sent to Norfolk Regional Center, a mental health facility, after the charges were dropped. In May 1980, Hatcher was released from the facility, but was sent back two months later for another assault. He escaped in September. On October 9, 1980, Hatcher was arrested as Richard Clark in Lincoln, Nebraska for the attempted assault and sodomy of a 17‚Äëyear‚Äëold boy. He was sent to another mental health facility and released after 21 days. On January 13, 1981, Hatcher was arrested as Richard Clark in Des Moines, Iowa after a knife fight. He spent time in several mental health facilities and was released to a Davenport Salvation Army shelter in April. Melvin Reynolds On May 26, 1978, four‚Äëyear‚Äëold Eric Christgen disappeared from downtown St. Joseph, Missouri. His body was later found along the Missouri River; he had been sexually abused and died of suffocation.The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers p. 217 The police questioned more than 100 possible suspects, including \\"every known pervert in town\\", to no avail. One of them was Melvin Reynolds, a 25‚Äëyear‚Äëold man of limited intelligence who had been sexually abused himself as a child and who had homosexual experiences as an adolescent. Reynolds, although agitated by the investigation, cooperated through several interrogations over a period of months, including two polygraph examinations and one interrogation under hypnosis. In December 1978, he was questioned under amobarbitalbelieved at the time to be a truth serumand made an ambiguous remark that intensified police suspicion. Two months later, in February 1979, the police brought the still cooperative Reynolds in for another round of interrogation: fourteen hours of questions, promises, and threats. Finally, Reynolds gave in and said, \\"I'll say so if you want me to\\". In the weeks that followed, Reynolds embellished this confession with details that were fed to him, deliberately or otherwise. That was enough to convince the prosecutor to charge Reynolds, and to convince a jury to convict him of second‚Äëdegree murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Four years later, Reynolds was released when Charles Hatcher confessed to three murders to an FBI agent, including that of Eric Christgen. Death On July 29, 1982, 11‚Äëyear‚Äëold Michelle Steele was reported missing from St.Joseph. The day after, her uncle found her nude, ravaged body on a bank of the Missouri River. She had been beaten and strangled to death. Hatcher was arrested the following day, as he tried to check in at the St.Joseph State Hospital. While awaiting trial, he confessed to fifteen other murders dating from 1969. The first victim, 12‚Äëyear‚Äëold William Freeman, had disappeared from Antioch, California in August of that year, one day before Hatcher was charged with child molestation in nearby San Francisco. In another case, Hatcher penned a crude map that led searchers to the remains of 28-year-old James Churchill,Encyclopedia of Serial Killers p. 217 buried on the grounds of the Rock Island Army Arsenal, near Davenport, Iowa. It was then that he also confessed to the murder of Eric Christgen. He was convicted of the Christgen homicide in October 1983, and drew a term of life imprisonment with no parole for at least 50 years. Facing his second Missouri conviction a year later for the murder of Michelle Steele, Hatcher requested a death sentence, but the jury refused, recommending life on December 3, 1984. Four days later, Hatcher hanged himself in his cell, at the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City.

The skill typically begins from a handstand followed by a swing backward and release after 3/4 of a revolution around the bar. The skill begins as a backward salto with the gymnast completing a 1/2 twist (180¬∞) before regrasp on the same bar that was released.

It contains exhibits relating to the First Indochina War and the Vietnam War. History Operated by the Vietnamese government, an earlier version of this museum opened on September 4, 1975, as the Exhibition House for US and Puppet Crimes (). It was located in the former United States Information Agency building. The exhibition was not the first of its kind for the North Vietnamese side, but rather followed a tradition of such exhibitions exposing war crimes, first those of the French and then those of the Americans, who had operated in the country as early as 1954. In 1990, the name was changed to Exhibition House for Crimes of War and Aggression (Nh√† tr∆∞ng b√†y t·ªôi √°c chi·∫øn tranh x√¢m l∆∞·ª£c), dropping both \\"U.S.\\" and \\"Puppet.\\" In 1995, following the normalization of diplomatic relations with the United States and end of the US embargo a year before, the references to \\"war crimes\\" and \\"aggression\\" were dropped from the museum's title as well; it became the War Remnants Museum. Exhibits The museum comprises a series of themed rooms in several buildings, with period military equipment placed within a walled yard. The military equipment includes a UH-1 \\"Huey\\" helicopter, an F-5A fighter, a BLU-82 \\"Daisy Cutter\\" bomb, M48 Patton tank, an A-1 Skyraider attack bomber, and an A-37 Dragonfly attack bomber. There are a number of pieces of unexploded ordnance stored in the corner of the yard, with their charges and/or fuses removed. One building reproduces the \\"tiger cages\\" in which the South Vietnamese government kept political prisoners. Other exhibits include graphic photography, accompanied by a short text in English, Vietnamese and Japanese, covering the effects of Agent Orange and other chemical defoliant sprays, the use of napalm and phosphorus bombs, and war atrocities such as the My Lai massacre. The photographic display includes work by Vietnam War photojournalist Bunyo Ishikawa that he donated to the museum in 1998. Curiosities include a guillotine used by the French and South Vietnamese to execute prisoners, the last time being in 1960, and three jars of preserved human fetuses deformed by exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, contained in the defoliant Agent Orange.  Reception  The War Remnants Museum is currently one of the most popular museums in Vietnam, attracting approximately half a million visitors every year. According to the museum's own estimates, about two-thirds of these are foreigners. US anthropologist Christina Schwenkel wrote the museum attempts to convey historical truths with 'self-representation', presenting images and other features without contextualising them as other museums do. Museum curators are described as being privy to the fact that knowledge about the Vietnam War and the interests of the Vietnamese is not typically known in other nations. An analysis of the impression books (which the tourists may use to leave their comments in at the exit) revealed that the museum's visitors used to be mostly Europeans and North Americans before 2005, but that its audience became much more varied after Vietnam dropped their visa requirement for ASEAN countries that year. The impression books also record mixed responses to the museum. Others simply praised Vietnam, while some Americans harshly criticized the museum for its \\"propaganda\\" and \\"glorification of [their] victory\\". Broadening interests have expanded from other countries as well, including visits from tourists from Brazil, Turkey, South Africa and others expanding to see the museum.

(EPE) is a corporate entity created by \\"The Elvis Presley Trust\\" to conduct business and manage its assets, including Graceland.EPE Corporate Info. , Official website, Retrieved 2010-01-03 EPE's business extends far beyond the Graceland operation, however, and includes worldwide licensing of Elvis-related products and ventures, the development of Elvis-related music, film, video, television and stage productions, the ongoing development of EPE's Internet presence, the management of significant music publishing assets and more. Origins After Elvis Presley's death on August 16, 1977 at Graceland, his will appointed his father, Vernon Presley, as executor and trustee. The beneficiaries of the trust were Vernon, Elvis' grandmother Minnie Mae Presley, and his nine-year- old daughter Lisa Marie Presley. After Vernon's death in 1979, Elvis' ex-wife Priscilla Presley, as Lisa Marie's legal guardian, began co-managing the trust along with the National Bank of Commerce in Memphis, which was the bank Elvis and Vernon had done business with, and Joseph Hanks, who had been Elvis and Vernon's accountant for a number of years, and formed EPE in 1979.\\"The Presley Inheritance\\" March 1, 1993, People magazine With Minnie Mae's passing in 1980, Lisa Marie became the only surviving beneficiary named in Elvis's will. Parker's dealings Following Elvis' death, his manager \\"Colonel Tom\\" Parker had set up a licensing operation with Factors Etc. Inc, to control Presley merchandise and keep a steady income supporting his estate.Adams (2008), The Elvis Encyclopedia, p.148 Due to an ill-advised agreement between Parker and Elvis which gave RCA sole ownership of all his recording royalties prior to 1973, the estate was relying heavily on the income from Factors Etc. Inc. However, because Parker was still entitled to 50% of all Elvis' income, and after taxes were taken off, the overall amount going towards the upkeep of the estate was less than $1 million a year. By 1980 the cost of running the estate was estimated to be as much as $500,000 a year. Priscilla and the Trust weren't prepared to let Parker continue to handle Elvis's business affairs, and petitioned the court to that end. However, Judge Joseph Evans, aware that Lisa Marie Presley was still a minor, appointed attorney Blanchard E. Tual to investigate Parker's management. His preliminary finding was that Parker's management deal of 50% was extortionate compared to the industry average of 15-20%. He also noted that Parker's handling of Elvis's business affairs during his lifetime, including the decision to sell off past royalties to RCA for $5.4 million in 1973, were \\"unethical\\" and poorly handled. During a second, more detailed investigation, all earnings were paid directly to the Trust instead of Parker. By this time, with the IRS demanding almost $15 million in taxes, the estate was facing bankruptcy. On August 14, 1981 Judge Evans ordered EPE to sue Parker for mismanagement. In response to this, Parker countersued. The case against Parker was settled out of court in 1983, with the estate paying him $2 million, and the termination of his involvement in any Elvis related earnings for five years. He was also ordered to hand over any Elvis audio recordings or visual images that he owned. Opening of Graceland During the court case Priscilla was advised to sell Graceland to avoid bankruptcy. She decided against this because she had no plans to sell off her daughter's first home. In late 1981, the estate hired Jack Soden, at the time a Missouri investment counselor, to plan and execute the opening of Graceland to the public and oversee the total operation. Graceland opened for tours on June 7, 1982. Interest in Graceland was such that EPE decided to expand its operation. In 1983, they acquired the shopping center plaza across the street from Graceland. The plaza was built in the sixties, and had been a typical suburban strip shopping center. However, after Elvis' death, it became filled with Elvis souvenir shops, which carried mostly bootleg items not licensed by the Presley Estate. In 1993, Graceland purchased the property and all the shops and attractions in what is now known as Graceland Plaza are owned and operated by EPE. By the mid-1980s EPE was interested in securing the rights to Elvis' image and intellectual property. Following many court cases against business and private parties, EPE helped to push through new copyright and trademark legislation in the United States. In 1991, Graceland was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1999 EPE purchased and redeveloped what became The Elvis Presley Heartbreak Hotel. According to Sean O'Neal, \\"Elvis is a cultural icon today, but he didn't become that way simply because of his talent and good looks. There was money to be made ... so a company was founded to create this icon, and it has controlled his image ... \\" The author describes EPE as a \\"well-run marketing machine\\" that runs on tight regulation of Elvis's images and lawsuits, when necessary. EPE, for instance, \\"absolutely refuses to license a product picturing an overweight Elvis.\\" Since 1979 \\"EPE has filed more than a hundred lawsuits to assert the estate's exclusive right to Elvis's name and likeness.\\"Sean O'Neal, Elvis Inc.: The Fall and Rise of the Presley Empire (1997). Later, EPE was wholly owned by the \\"Elvis Presley Trust\\" and Elvis' daughter, Lisa Marie Presley until February 2005, when Robert F.X. Sillerman and his new media and entertainment company CKX acquired an 85% interest in Elvis Presley Enterprises, including its physical and intellectual properties. In November 2013, the company sold its 85% interest in EPE to Authentic Brands Group.Sold!

Past this, PA 168 turns northeast and becomes a two-lane undivided road again, running through more woods. The route heads into residential areas and turns north onto Moravia Street, crossing into the city of New Castle. Here, the route continues north to an intersection with PA 18/PA 108. At this point, PA 18 and PA 108 turn north to follow PA 168 on Moravia Street, passing more industry with some businesses. The road crosses two New Castle Industrial Railroad lines and becomes South Jefferson Street. PA 108 and PA 168 split from PA 18 by turning northeast onto four-lane undivided South Croton Avenue, passing between the Neshannock Creek to the northwest and industrial areas to the southeast. The road crosses US 422 Business and continues to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 65. PA 108/PA 168 becomes North Croton Avenue and runs between the creek to the northwest and woods and homes to the southeast. The two routes turn away from the creek and head northeast through residential areas with some businesses. The road curves more to the east, with PA 168 splitting from PA 108 by heading northeast on Eastbrook Road. The route crosses into Hickory Township and heads through areas of homes and farms with some woods. The road heads through more farmland and woodland with some residences, curving east and passing through East Brook. PA 168 turns northeast again and becomes Eastbrook Volant Road, intersecting the northern terminus of PA 388. Here, the road curves north and runs through more agricultural areas with some woods and homes. The route intersects PA 956 immediately before crossing into Wilmington Township. PA 168 continues north-northeast through rural areas in northern Lawrence County that are home to an Amish community, crossing into Washington Township, becoming unnamed and coming to its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 208 in the borough of Volant. History =Northern terminus= The segment of PA 168 north of the Ohio River originally started north then turned eastbound in Ohioville to its northern terminus at PA 68 in Beaver. In 1936, this was changed to continue north past Ohioville, allowing PA 168 to extend up through New Castle/Lawrence County and to its new northern terminus at PA 208 in Leesburg/Mercer County. In 1959, nearby PA 278 was decommissioned and replaced as a realignment of PA 208; thus, PA 168 and PA 208 ran concurrent for the former's last three miles. By 1970, PA 168's northern terminus was truncated to its current location at the PA 208 junction in Volant/Lawrence County. =Ohio River crossings= From Hookstown northbound, PA 168 originally ran up Main and Hill Streets through Georgetown to Smith's Ferry which was used to cross the Ohio River to join the route's northern segment on Smith's Ferry Road in Ohioville. Both segments leading to the Ohio were later relocated. In 1946, the entire Smith's Ferry Road segment from the north was moved east onto Fairview Road and continued southbound onto Midland Avenue, forming a concurrency with PA 68 through Midland to Cooks Ferry in Industry. This left an uneven \\"gap\\" with the southern route until 1951 when PA 168 was moved out of Georgetown and rerouted along Pine Street in Hookstown to Cooks Ferry in Shippingport. Cooks Ferry provided the necessary PA 168 connection across the river between Shippingport and Industry until it was replaced with the Shippingport Bridge in 1964.

The community's name is pronounced . The village is said to have been founded on the eve of the birth of a girl in March 1892. Since then, Equinunk has grown to become the home to 1200 (as of Jan. 2012.) The village stands at an elevation of 900 ft, where the Equinunk Creek flows into the Delaware River. While Equinunk is situated on the southern shore, the northern shore carries a commercial, single-track rail line which has been in operation since 1869. Due to its proximity to the tracks, cargo train enthusiasts from around the country come to Equinunk to view the often 50+ car trains roll along the winding Delaware River. With a fairly even sex distribution and the median age of its inhabitants at 49 years, Equinunk is statistically similar to many other towns and villages in the area. However, its small size makes it unique. The village is served by a United States Postal Office branch (ZIP code 18417), Hunt's General Store, an independent retail establishment, a traditional Methodist church, and a local bar. Wendy's Village Barn Restaurant closed in 2011. The Equinunk Historical Society began with a series of organizational meetings starting in March 1981, with the stated purpose of bringing together those people interested in the history of Equinunk, Stockport, Dillontown, Lordville, and surrounding areas of northern Wayne County, and to discover and collect any material which may help to establish or illustrate the history of the area and provide for the preservation of such material and for its accessibility as far as may be feasible, to all who wish to study or examine it. Specifically, the society promotes the Joel Hill Water-Powered Sawmill. * The Hill Sawmill was built by William Holbert and J. D. Branning just after the Civil War, one of many they owned in the area. Joel Hill purchased the Mill from the Holbert heirs in 1898, along with 1500 acres of timberlands and the 205 acre body of water known as Duck Harbor. The Mill remained in operation until 1974. * The sawmill was entirely powered by water. In the winter, loggers gathered timber and piled it on the hill across the road from the pond. In the spring, employees would pull the stop blocks out and the logs would roll down the hill into the pond. They were cleaned off and dragged into the mill with grabs attached to a huge rope. * Employees would raise the wooden gate in the sawmill dam and let water into the 28-inch pipe, or penstock, leading into the turbine. The turbine rotates the power take off shaft, which runs the entire mill. Originally, a water wheel was used, but it was washed away in the Pumpkin Flood of 1903. Through a series of belts and pulleys, the 54-inch saw blade is turned at 850 RPM. * The mill is open five times a year and there is much more to learn and see. * If one stands at the crossroads of Pennsylvania Route 191 and Pine Mill Road in Equinunk and then turns to face an old gray and white house, (now white with a green roof) he will be looking at the headquarters of the Equinunk Historical Society. This same house was once the farmhouse of H.N. Farley's Equinunk Manor Dairy Farm, as well as the Earl and Ethel Lord boardinghouse. When they purchased the place in 1915, they knew it to be over 100 years old, but no documents exist to absolutely prove this. Ann Preston Vail has a very early parchment map showing two structures, once of which may well be this house. The map, handed down in the papers of Samuel Preston, who was a land agent and manager for Henry Drinker of Philadelphia, and also the great-great-great-grandfather of Ms. Vail, is known to be authentic. Henry Drinker was a large holder of lands in NE Pa. This land was originally surveyed as of December 8, 1773 for the Proprietors, or the William Penn family, as Equinunk Manor, amounting to 2222 acres. Preston acquired the land from Penn's heirs in 1812. It then passed to his sons, Paul and Warner, in 1831. They then sold it in 1833, recorded in 1834, to Alexander Calder and Israel Chapman. This was the last sale of the entire tract. These two divided it the same year, Calder retaining land on both sides of the creek in Equinunk, and Chapman taking the land up-creek. * H.N. Farley bought the Calder lands and buildings from the estate of Joseph Calder in 1879. The next sale was to the Lords in 1915. They sold it to Martin Perrone in 1949, when it was converted into a barbershop and beauty parlor. In 1969 Scott and Donna Eldred bought the house, to be followed by Christine and Ross Hessberger in 1971. The Equinunk Historical Society bought the house in 1983. * The original part of the house exhibits the Greek Classic Revival style of architecture, although the old clapboard siding is hidden under asbestos shingles put on by Martin Perrone. (They were removed and the wood siding was newly painted in July 2003.) * There is much more information on the house contained in books and papers available at the Museum. Plan a trip to see us soon and watch the papers for programs during the summer and fall. Despite its small size, the area has two long-running summer camps: Camp Equinunk, which was founded in 1920, and Camp Blue Ridge, which was founded in 1923.

Although it was close to fascism and to some far-right leagues, the PRS later joined the left-wing, and several of its members, including Georges Valois himself, took part in the French Resistance. It is representative of the French non-conformist movement of the 1930s. The PRS published a press organ, the Cahiers Bleus which published at the Librairie Valois edition its first numero on 15 August 1928 and its 119th and last issue on 23 May 1932, during the Second Cartel des gauches (Left-wing Coalition).

It is a long-acting analogue of somatostatin, like octreotide. Its sequence is H-D-2Nal-Cys(1)-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys(1)-Thr-NH2. Lanreotide (as lanreotide acetate) is manufactured by Ipsen, and marketed under the trade name Somatuline. It is available in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, and was approved for sale in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 30, 2007. Pharmacology Lanreotide is a synthetic analogue of somatostatin, a naturally occurring inhibitory hormone which blocks the release of several other hormones, including growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin and glucagon. Lanreotide binds to the same receptors as somatostatin, although with higher affinity to peripheral receptors, and has similar activity. However, while somatostatin is quickly broken down in the body (within minutes), lanreotide has a much longer half-life, and produces far more prolonged effects. The efficacy of lanreotide has not been extensively studied, and results differ greatly between trials and formulations. Indications Lanreotide is used in the treatment of acromegaly, due to both pituitary and non-pituitary growth hormone-secreting tumors, and the management of symptoms caused by neuroendocrine tumors, particularly carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. In the United States and Canada, lanreotide is only indicated for the treatment of acromegaly. In the United Kingdom, it is also indicated in the treatment of thyrotrophic adenoma, a rare tumor of the pituitary gland which secretes TSH. Lanreotide also shows activity against non-endocrine tumors, and, along with other somatostatin analogues, is being studied as a possible general antitumor agent. In Dec 2014 the US FDA approved lanreotide for the treatment of patients with unresectable, well or moderately differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). It is used for polycystic liver disease. It has also been shown that it reduces the volume by 264mls on average. Side effects The main side effects of lanreotide treatment are mild to moderate pain at the injection site and gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Isolated cases of gallstone formation have been associated with use of lanreotide, particularly over long periods of time. Formulations Lanreotide is available in two formulations: a sustained release formulation (sold under the trade name 'Somatuline LA'), which is injected intramuscularly every ten or fourteen days, and an extended release formulation (UK trade name 'Somatuline Autogel', or 'Somatuline Depot' in the U.S.), which is administered subcutaneously once a month. Self-assembling properties Lanreotide has been shown to spontaneously self-assemble into monodisperse nanotubes of 24.4 nm diameter and has been thereafter used as a fruitful and versatile model system in several biophysical studies.

This continued as a part of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) after the split of the organizations. After the Second Congress of the EPLF an offensive force was proposed and created with a base in Sudan. These forces played a critical role at the Battle of Massawa when they sank several Ethiopian warships in the harbor. At the close of the Eritrean War of Independence, the balance of the Ethiopian Navy was inherited by this naval force. Currently Since independence the Eritrean Navy has expanded its fleet of high-speed patrol boats.

The film was directed by Michael Winner and stars Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey, an architect who becomes a vigilante after his wife is murdered and his daughter sexually assaulted during a home invasion. This was the first film in the Death Wish franchise; it was followed eight years later with Death Wish II and other similar films. At the time of release, the film was criticized for its apparent support of vigilantism and advocating unlimited punishment of criminals. Allegedly, the novel denounced vigilantism, whereas the film embraced the notion. The film was a commercial success and resonated with the public in the United States, which was experiencing increasing crime rates during the 1970s. Plot Paul Kersey is a successful, middle-aged architect and family man who enjoys a happy home in Manhattan with his wife Joanna. One day, Joanna and their grown daughter Carol are followed home from D'Agostino's by three thugs, who invade the apartment by posing as deliverymen. Upon finding that Carol and Joanna only have $7 on them, the thugs rape Carol and brutally beat Joanna before fleeing. Upon arriving at the hospital, Paul is devastated to learn that Joanna has died from her injuries. Shortly after attending his wife's funeral, Paul has an encounter with a mugger in a darkened street. Paul fights back with a homemade weapon, an improvised blackjack made from a sock with two rolls of quarters in it, causing the mugger to run away. Paul is shaken and energized by the encounter. Paul's boss sends him to Tucson, Arizona, to see Ames Jainchill, a client with a residential development project. A few days later, Paul is invited to dinner by Ames at his gun club. Ames is impressed with Paul's pistol marksmanship at the target range. Paul reveals that he was a conscientious objector during the Korean War, when he served as a combat medic. He had been taught to handle firearms by his father, a hunter, but after his father was killed in a hunting accident, Paul's mother made him swear never to use guns again. Paul is successful in helping Ames plan his residential housing development. Ames drives Paul back to Tucson Airport and presents Paul with a gift for his work on the development, which he places into Paul's checked luggage. Back in Manhattan, Paul learns from his son-in-law, Jack, that his daughter is severely depressed from the trauma of the assault and is now catatonic, and they have Carol committed to a mental hospital. Paul learns that Ames has given him a nickel-plated Colt Police Positive revolver and a box of ammunition. He loads it and takes a late-night walk during which he is mugged at gunpoint. Paul shoots the mugger, and in a state of shock, he runs home and vomits. The next night, Paul walks through the city looking for violent criminals. Over the next few weeks, Paul kills several criminals, some of whom he lures into attacking him by presenting himself as an affluent victim for a mugging, and others when he sees them attacking innocent people. NYPD Inspector Frank Ochoa investigates the vigilante killings. His department narrows it down to a list of men who have had a family member recently killed by muggers and are war veterans. Ochoa soon suspects Paul and is about to make an arrest when the district attorney intervenes and tells Ochoa that \\"we don't want him.\\" The district attorney and the police commissioner do not want the fact to get out that Paul's vigilantism has led to a drastic decrease in street crime, and they fear that if that information becomes public knowledge, the whole city will descend into vigilante chaos, but they do not want Paul to be arrested because they do not want a martyr. Ochoa does not like the idea but relents and agrees to try to \\"scare him off\\". One night, Paul shoots two more muggers before being wounded in the leg by a third mugger with a pistol, whom he pursues to a warehouse. When Paul corners him, he challenges him to a fast draw, only to faint because of blood loss, with the mugger escaping. His gun is discovered by a young patrolman, Jackson Reilly, who hands it to Ochoa and is told to forget he ever saw it. The press is informed that Paul is just another mugging victim. Hospitalized, Paul is told by Ochoa to have his company transfer him to another city, and in exchange, Ochoa will dispose of Paul's revolver. In addition, Paul is ordered by Ochoa to leave New York permanently. Paul arrives in Chicago Union Station by train. Being greeted by a company representative, he notices a group of hoodlums harassing a young woman. He excuses himself and helps the woman. The hoodlums make obscene gestures, but Paul makes a finger gun at them and smiles. Cast * Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey * Hope Lange as Joanna Kersey * Vincent Gardenia as NYPD Lt.

Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, who later co-starred on the television show Welcome Back, Kotter, had an uncredited role as one of the Central Park muggers near the end of the film. It has been rumored that Denzel Washington made his screen debut as an uncredited alley mugger since in a long shot, the actor shown appears to resemble him, but Washington stated that not to be true. Actress Helen Martin, who had a minor role as a mugging victim who fights off her attackers with a hatpin, subsequently appeared in the television sitcoms Good Times and 227. Christopher Guest made one of his earliest film appearances as a young police officer who finds Kersey's gun. Marcia Jean Kurtz, who played the receptionist at Paul's office, has appeared in multiple roles on the TV series Law & Order. Sonia Manzano, who played Maria on Sesame Street, had an uncredited role as a supermarket checkout clerk. The film also marked Jeff Goldblum's screen debut, playing one of the \\"freaks\\" who assaults Kersey's family early in the film. Production The film was based on Brian Garfield's 1972 novel of the same name. Garfield was inspired to use the theme of vigilantism following incidents in his personal life. In one incident, his wife's purse was stolen; in another, his car was vandalized. His initial thought each time was that he could kill \\"the son of a bitch\\" responsible. He later considered that these were primitive thoughts, contemplated in an unguarded moment. He then thought of writing a novel about a man who entered that way of thinking in a moment of rage and then never emerged from it.Talbot (2006), p. 1-31 The original novel received favorable reviews but was not a bestseller. Garfield sold screen rights to both Death Wish and Relentless to the only film producers who approached him, Hal Landers and Bobby Roberts. He was offered the chance to write a screenplay adapting one of the two novels, and chose Relentless. He simply considered it the easier of the two to turn into a film. Wendell Mayes was then hired to write the screenplay for Death Wish. He preserved the basic structure of the novel and much of the philosophical dialogue. It was his idea to turn police detective Frank Ochoa into a major character of the film. His early drafts for the screenplay had different endings from the final one. In one, he followed an idea from Garfield. The vigilante confronts the three thugs who attacked his family and ends up dead at their hands. Ochoa discovers the dead man's weapon and considers following in his footsteps. In another, the vigilante is wounded and rushed to a hospital. His fate is left ambiguous. Meanwhile, Ochoa has found the weapon and struggles with the decision to use it. His decision is left unclear. Originally, Sidney Lumet was to have directed Jack Lemmon as Paul and Henry Fonda as Ochoa. Lumet bowed out of the project to direct Serpico (1973), requiring a search for another director. Several were considered, including Peter Medak who wanted Henry Fonda as Paul.p. 23 Ross, Cai Ghost Buster in Cinema Retro Vol 15 Issue #43 Winter 2019 United Artists eventually chose Michael Winner, due to his track record of gritty, violent action films. The examples of his work considered included The Mechanic (1972), Scorpio (1973), and The Stone Killer (1973). The film was rejected by other studios because of its controversial subject matter and the perceived difficulty of casting someone in the vigilante role. Winner attempted to recruit Bronson, but there were two problems for the actor. One was that his agent, Paul Kohner, considered that the film carried a dangerous message. The other was that the screenplay then followed the original novel in describing the vigilante as a meek accountant, hardly a suitable role for Bronson. \\"I was really a miscast person,\\" Bronson said later. \\"It was more a theme that would have been better for Dustin Hoffman or somebody who could play a weaker kind of man. I told them that at the time.\\"For Bronson, Piecework Is a Virtue: Movies Piecework a Virtue for Charles Bronson Piecework a Virtue for Bronson Warga, Wayne. Los Angeles Times 2 Nov 1975: o1 The film project was dropped by United Artists after budget constraints forced producers Hal Landers and Bobby Roberts to liquidate their rights. The original producers were replaced by Italian film mogul Dino De Laurentiis. De Laurentiis convinced Charles Bluhdorn to bring the project to Paramount Pictures. Paramount purchased the distribution rights of the film in the United States market, while Columbia Pictures licensed the distribution rights for international markets. De Laurentiis raised the $3 million budget of the film by pre-selling the distribution rights. With funding secured, screenwriter Gerald Wilson was hired to revise the script. His first task was changing the identity of the vigilante to make the role more suitable for Bronson. \\"Paul Benjamin\\" was renamed to \\"Paul Kersey.\\" His job was changed from accountant to architect. His background changed from a World War II veteran to a Korean War veteran. The reason for him not seeing combat duty changed from serving as an army accountant to being a conscientious objector. Several vignettes from Mayes' script were deemed unnecessary and so were deleted. Winner himself asked for several revisions in the script. Both the novel and the original script had no scenes showing the vigilante interacting with his wife. Winner decided to include a prologue depicting a happy relationship and so the prologue of the film depicts the couple vacationing in Hawaii. The early draft of the script had the vigilante being inspired by seeing a fight scene in the Western film High Noon. Winner decided on a more elaborate scene, involving a fight scene in a recreation of the Wild West, taking place in Tucson, Arizona. The final script had the vigilante making an occasional reference to Westerns. While confronting an armed mugger, he challenges him to draw (Kersey tells him to \\"fill your hand,\\" the same challenge issued by Western movie icon John Wayne to his main opponent in the climactic shootout in 1969's True Grit). When Ochoa tells him to get out of town, he asks if he has until sundown to do so. The killing in the subway station was supposed to remain off-screen in Mayes' script, but Winner decided to turn this into an actual, brutal scene. A minor argument occurred when it came to a shooting location for the film. Bronson asked for a California-based location so that he could visit his family in Bel Air, Los Angeles. Winner insisted on New York City and De Laurentiis agreed. Ultimately, Bronson backed down. Death Wish was shot on location in New York City during the winter of 1973‚Äì1974. Death Wish was first released to American audiences in July 1974. The world premiere took place on July 24 in the Loews Theater of New York City. Soundtrack Multiple Grammy award-winning jazz musician Herbie Hancock produced and composed the original score for the soundtrack to the movie. It was his third film score, after the 1966 movie Blow-Up and The Spook Who Sat By The Door (1973). Michael Winner said, \\"[Dino] De Laurentiis said 'Get a cheap English band.' Because the English bands were very successful. But I had a girlfriend who was in Sesame Street, a Puerto Rican actress (Sonia Manzano), who played a checkout girl at the supermarket [in Death Wish], and she was a great jazz fan. She said, 'Well, you should have Herbie Hancock. He's got this record out called Head Hunters.' She gave me Head Hunters, which was staggering. And I said, 'Dino, never mind a cheap English band, we'll have Herbie Hancock.' Which we did.\\" Hancock's theme for the film was quoted in \\"Judge, Jury and Executioner,\\" a 2013 single by Atoms for Peace. Reception Death Wish received mixed reviews upon its release because of its support of vigilantism, but it affected US audiences and began widespread debate over how to deal with rampant crime. The film's graphic violence, particularly the brutal rape scene of Kersey's daughter and the explicit portrayal of Kersey's premeditated slayings, was considered exploitative but realistic in the context of the US atmosphere of rising urban crime rates. Many critics were displeased with the film, considering it an \\"immoral threat to society\\" and an encouragement of antisocial behavior. Vincent Canby of The New York Times was one of the most outspoken writers, condemning Death Wish in two extensive articles. Roger Ebert awarded three stars out of four and praised the \\"cool precision\\" of Winner's direction but did not agree with the film's philosophy.Death Wish, Roger Ebert's Movie Reviews. Chicago Sun-Times. Retrieved December 3, 2018. Gene Siskel gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that its setup \\"makes no attempt at credibility; its goal is to present a syllogism that argues for vengeance, and to present it so swiftly that one doesn't have time to consider its absurdity.\\"Siskel, Gene (August 9, 1974). \\"'Death' moves at a killing pace to prove its point\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 3. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a despicable motion picture... It is nasty and demagogic stuff, an appeal to brute emotions and against reason.\\"Champlin, Charles (July 31, 1974). \\"Running Amok for Law, Order\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post described the film as \\"simplistic to the point of stasis. Scarcely a single sensible insight into urban violence occurs; the killings just plod one after another as Bronson stalks New York's crime-ridden streets.\\"Arnold, Gary (August 22, 1974). \\"'Death Wish': Vigilante Justice\\". The Washington Post. B13. Clyde Jeavons of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Superficially, it's not all that far removed from a Budd Boetticher revenge Western ... The difference, of course, is that Michael Winner has none of Boetticher's indigenous sense of allegory or his instinct for what constitutes a good folk-mythology, let alone his relish for three-dimensional villains.\\" Garfield was also unhappy with the final product, calling the film \\"incendiary\\" and stated that the film's sequels are all pointless and rancid since they advocate vigilantism unlike his two novels, which make the opposite argument. The film led him to write a follow-up titled Death Sentence, which was published a year after the film's release. In later years, the film would be liked for its disturbing, serious view of one man's violent war on crime. Bronson defended the film and felt that it was intended to be a commentary on violence and was meant to attack violence, not romanticize it. Many critics rate the original film higher than the sequels, which were more exploitative and contrived. On Rotten Tomatoes Death Wish has an approval rating of 68% based on reviews from 28 critics. =Accolades= The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2001: AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills ‚Äì Nominated * 2003: AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains: ** Paul Kersey ‚Äì Nominated Hero Impact and influence Death Wish was a watershed for Bronson, who was 53 years old at the time, and who was then better known in Europe and Asia for his role in The Great Escape. Bronson became an American film icon, who experienced great popularity over the next twenty years. * In the series' later years, the Death Wish franchise became a subject of parody for its high level of violence and the advancing age of Bronson (a 1995 episode of The Simpsons, \\"A Star Is Burns,\\" showed a fictional advertisement for Death Wish 9, consisting of a bed-ridden Bronson saying \\"I wish I was dead\\").

According to Crow, Elvis Presley occupies an important place among lesbian icons. She says, When the organizers of the Second International Elvis Presley Conference, held at the University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi, in August 1996, invited Elvis Herselvis to perform at the conference, the conference organizer, Professor Vernon Chadwick, \\"sought 'to test the limits of race, class, sexuality and property ...'\\" He was of the opinion that \\"the conference must comply 'with all applicable laws regarding affirmative action and equal opportunity in all its activities and programs and does not discriminate against anyone protected by law because of age, creed, color, national origin, race, religion, sex, handicap, veteran, or other status'. Whilst these intentions were widely known, a number of local Baptist Ministers complained to the Mayor of Tupelo about the inclusion of Elvis Herselvis on the conference program and sought to block funding for the conference. The church's concerns were supported by the organiser of the Elvis birthplace and Museum, then EPE followed suit.

He was a member of the prestigious Ewing family, son of Thomas Ewing, the eldest brother of Thomas Ewing, Jr. and Charles Ewing, and the foster brother and brother-in-law of William T. Sherman. General Ewing was an ambitious, literate, and erudite officer who held a strong sense of responsibility for the men under his command. He combined his West Point experience with the Civil War system of officer election. Ewing's wartime service was characterized by several incidents which would have a unique impact on history. In 1861, his political connections helped save the reputation of his brother-in-law, William T. Sherman, who went on to become one of the north's most successful generals. Ewing himself went on to become Sherman's most trusted subordinate. His campaigning eventually led to the near-banishment of Lorenzo Thomas, a high-ranking regular army officer who had intrigued against Sherman. He was present at the Battle of Antietam, where his brigade saved the flank of the Union Army late in the day. During the Vicksburg campaign, Ewing accidentally came across personal correspondence from Confederate President Jefferson F. Davis to former President Franklin Pierce which eventually ruined the reputation of the latter.Robert Melvin to Jefferson Davis, July 22, 1863, in Mississippi in the Confederacy: As They Saw it, ed. John K. Bettersworth, pp. 210-12Crist, pp. 191-93 Ewing was also present in Kentucky during Major General Stephen G. Burbridge's \\"reign of terror\\", where he worked to oppose Burbridge's harsh policies against civilians, but was hampered by debilitating rheumatism. He ended the war with an independent command, a sign he held the confidence of his superiors, acting in concert with Sherman to trap Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston in North Carolina. After the war, Ewing spent time as Ambassador to the Netherlands and became a noted author. He died in 1905 on his family farm. Early life and career Hugh Ewing was born in Lancaster, Ohio. He was educated at the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was forced to resign on the eve of graduation after failing an engineering exam, which was a major embarrassment to his family. While a member of the cadet corps, he was close friends with future Union generals John Buford Jr., Nathaniel C. McLean, and John C. Tidball.Longacre, p. 25 His father appointed Philip Sheridan to the open seat.Ohio In the Civil War, Trail II \\"The Generals\\" During the gold rush in 1849, Ewing went to California, where he joined an expedition ordered by his father, then Secretary of the Interior, to rescue immigrants who were imprisoned in the Sierra by heavy snows. He returned in 1852 with dispatches for the government. He then completed his course in law and settled in St. Louis. He practiced law there from 1854 to 1856, when he moved with his young brother, Thomas Jr., and brothers-in-law William T. Sherman and Hampden B. Denman to Leavenworth, Kansas, and began speculating in lands, roads, and government housing. They quickly established one of the leading law firms of Leavenworth, as well as a financially powerful land agency.Rossman 1980, p. 121 In 1858, Ewing married Henrietta Young, daughter of George W. Young, a large planter of the District of Columbia, whose family was prominent in the settlement and history of Maryland. He soon afterward took charge of his father's salt works in Ohio. Civil War In April 1861, Governor William Dennison appointed Ewing as the brigade-inspector of Ohio volunteers. He served under Rosecrans and McClellan in western Virginia. Ewing became colonel of the 30th Ohio Volunteer Infantry in August 1861. In November 1861, when his brother-in-law William T. Sherman was relieved of his command in disgrace, Ewing aided his younger sister Ellen Ewing Sherman in making the rounds of Washington D.C., denying sensationalist media claims that Sherman was insane, and personally lobbying the President for Sherman's reinstatement. Ewing and his sister argued that Sherman's requests for men and material in Kentucky had been denied in Washington, and that the charges of insanity had been part of a conspiracy orchestrated by Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas. Eventually the political influence of the Ewing family persevered, and with the assistance of Henry Halleck, Sherman was returned to command.Heidler, Jeanne, Heidler, David, & Coles, David. Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History. Santa Barbara, California, ABC-CLIO: 2000. President Abraham Lincoln praised Sherman's \\"talent & conduct\\" publicly to a large group of important officers, and later banished Thomas to a meaningless post on recruiting duty in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. Under McClellan, Ewing commanded a regiment and then a brigade in the Kanawha Division in the IX Corps. In the Battle of South Mountain, he led the assault which drove the enemy from the summit; and at midnight of that day, he received an order placing him in command of the brigade of Colonel Eliakim P. Scammon, who was in temporary command of the Kanawha division after its commander Major General Jacob D. Cox had been elevated to command of the IX Corps, replacing the fallen Major General Jesse Lee Reno who was killed earlier that day. At Antietam his brigade was placed upon the extreme left of the army, where, according to the report of the commander of the left wing, General Ambrose Burnside, \\"by a brilliant change of front he saved the left from being completely driven in.\\"Report of. Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, U. S. Army, Commanding Right Wing, Army of the Potomac, Of Operations September 7-19. After Antietam, Ewing was placed on sick leave because of chronic dysentery, and was promoted to Brigadier General on November 29, 1862. He transferred West and served throughout the campaign before Vicksburg, leading the assaults made by General Sherman; and upon its fall was placed in command of a division in the XVI Corps. At Chattanooga, he was given command of the 4th Division of the XV Corps, which formed the advance of Sherman's army and carried Missionary Ridge.Sword, p. 157 Prior to the Battle of Chattanooga, Ewing's command led a diversionary raid that resulted in the destruction of the Empire State Iron Works in Dade County, Georgia, which was being refurbished to increase the South's manufacturing capability.\\"Empire State Iron Works\\". Chickamauga Campaign Heritage Trail. Retrieved August 5, 2008. Sherman considered Ewing his most reliable division commander. In the aftermath of Vicksburg, Ewing's command wrecked Confederate President Jefferson Davis's Fleetwood Plantation, and Ewing turned over Davis' personal correspondence to his brother-in-law, Sherman. However, Ewing also sent copies of the letters to a few people he had known in Ohio, which, after the documents were published, permanently sullied the reputation of former President Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire. Their release coincided with that of Pierce's book, Our Old Home. As early as 1860, Pierce had written to Davis about \\"the madness of northern abolitionism\\", and other letters uncovered stated that he would \\"never justify, sustain, or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, aimless unnecessary war\\", and that \\"the true purpose of the war was to wipe out the states and destroy property.\\" In October 1863, Ewing was placed in command of the occupation forces in Louisville, Kentucky. He was unfortunate enough to serve during Maj. Gen. Stephen Gano Burbridge's \\"reign of terror,\\" where martial law was declared several times.Beach 1995, p. 177 On August 11, 1864, Burbridge ordered soldiers from the 26th Kentucky to select four men to be taken from prison in Louisville to Eminence, Kentucky, to be shot for unknown outrages, and on August 20, several suspected Confederate guerrillas were also to be taken from Louisville and executed. General Ewing declared their innocence and sought a pardon from Burbridge, but he refused to give the pardon and the men were shot.Beach 1995, p. 184 In his autobiography, Ewing describes an incident in October 1862 with Colonel Augustus Moor, who had struck a member of Ewing's regiment with his sword when the enlisted soldier had fallen out of a march. Ewing immediately confronted Moor. In his own words: Colonel Moor quickly apologized. While General Ewing respected the discipline of the German regiment, he preferred a different atmosphere in his own command, better suited to Americans. He was capable of recognizing the military tradition of other units while accommodating the unique needs of his own.Burton 1998, p. 205 General Ewing was ordered to North Carolina in 1865, and was planning an expedition up the Roanoke river to co-operate with the Army of the James, when Lee surrendered.Brown vol. III, p. 24 In 1864, Ewing suffered an attack of rheumatism, and received treatment several times thereafter, often being confined to his chair. He was likely prostrated with illness as Commander of Louisville during Burbridge's madness in Kentucky. He was made a brevet major general on March 13, 1865. After leaving the Army, he experienced painful attacks for the rest of his life, often bedridden for periods of up to forty days. Postbellum career President Andrew Johnson appointed Ewing as U.S. Minister to Holland, where he served from 1866 to 1870. This appointment may have drawn the ire of the Radical Republicans, for Speaker of the House James G. Blaine urged President Ulysses S. Grant that Ewing be recalled and replaced with his brother, Charles Ewing. Blaine told the President that Hugh was 'acting badly'. Blaine himself was disingenuous, having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator John Sherman that he was doing everything possible to nominate his close personal friend, former Ohio General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, for the post. Nonetheless, Blaine's request to recall General Ewing was never acted upon, possibly due to the influence of his sister, whose husband General Sherman was a very close friend to President Grant. Ewing was related to Blaine through Blaine's mother Maria Louise Gillespie Blaine. Upon his eventual return to the United States, Ewing retired to a farm near Lancaster, Ohio, where he died of old age. He was the author of: The Black List; A Tale of Early California (1887); A Castle in the Air (1887); The Gold Plague, and other works.

Two matrices p and q in M(2, R) have a sum p + q given by matrix addition. The product matrix is formed from the dot product of the rows and columns of its factors through matrix multiplication. For : q = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\end{pmatrix}, let : q^* = \\\\begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\\\\\\\\\\\ -c & a \\\\end{pmatrix}. Then q q = q q = (ad ‚àí bc) , where is the identity matrix. The real number ad ‚àí bc is called the determinant of q. When ad ‚àí bc ‚â† 0, q is an invertible matrix, and then :q^{-1} = \\\\frac{q^*}{ad - bc}. The collection of all such invertible matrices constitutes the general linear group GL(2, R). In terms of abstract algebra, M(2, R) with the associated addition and multiplication operations forms a ring, and GL(2, R) is its group of units. M(2, R) is also a four-dimensional vector space, so it is considered an associative algebra. The real matrices are in one-one correspondence with the linear mappings of the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system into itself by the rule : \\\\begin{pmatrix}x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\mapsto \\\\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}ax + by \\\\\\\\\\\\ cx + dy\\\\end{pmatrix}. The next section displays M(2,R) is a union of planar cross sections that include a real line. M(2,R) is ring isomorphic to split-quaternions, where there is a similar union but with index sets that are hyperboloids. Profile Within M(2, R), the multiples by real numbers of the identity matrix may be considered a real line. This real line is the place where all commutative subrings come together: Let Pm = {x + ym : x, y ‚àà R} where m2 ‚àà {‚àí, 0, }. Then Pm is a commutative subring and M(2, R) = ‚ãÉPm where the union is over all m such that m2 ‚àà {‚àí, 0, }. To identify such m, first square the generic matrix: :\\\\begin{pmatrix}aa + bc & ab + bd \\\\\\\\\\\\ ac + cd & bc + dd \\\\end{pmatrix}. When a + d = 0 this square is a diagonal matrix. Thus one assumes d = ‚àía when looking for m to form commutative subrings. When mm = ‚àí, then bc = ‚àí1 ‚àí aa, an equation describing a hyperbolic paraboloid in the space of parameters (a, b, c). Such an m serves as an imaginary unit. In this case Pm is isomorphic to the field of (ordinary) complex numbers. When mm = +, m is an involutory matrix. Then bc = +1 ‚àí aa, also giving a hyperbolic paraboloid. If a matrix is an idempotent matrix, it must lie in such a Pm and in this case Pm is isomorphic to the ring of split-complex numbers. The case of a nilpotent matrix, mm = 0, arises when only one of b or c is non-zero, and the commutative subring Pm is then a copy of the dual number plane. When M(2, R) is reconfigured with a change of basis, this profile changes to the profile of split-quaternions where the sets of square roots of and ‚àí take a symmetrical shape as hyperboloids. Equi-areal mapping First transform one differential vector into another: : \\\\begin{pmatrix}du \\\\\\\\\\\\ dv \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}p & r\\\\\\\\\\\\ q & s \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ dy \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}p\\\\, dx + r\\\\, dy \\\\\\\\\\\\ q\\\\, dx + s\\\\, dy\\\\end{pmatrix}. Areas are measured with density dx \\\\wedge dy, a differential 2-form which involves the use of exterior algebra. The transformed density is :\\\\begin{align} du \\\\wedge dv &= 0 + ps\\\\ dx \\\\wedge dy + qr\\\\ dy \\\\wedge dx + 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (ps - qr)\\\\ dx \\\\wedge dy \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\det(g)\\\\ dx \\\\wedge dy. \\\\end{align} Thus the equi-areal mappings are identified with SL(2, R) = {g ‚àà M(2, R) : det(g) = 1}, the special linear group. Given the profile above, every such g lies in a commutative subring Pm representing a type of complex plane according to the square of m. Since g g = , one of the following three alternatives occurs: * mm = ‚àí and g is on a circle of Euclidean rotations; or * mm = and g is on an hyperbola of squeeze mappings; or * mm = 0 and g is on a line of shear mappings. Writing about planar affine mapping, Rafael Artzy made a similar trichotomy of planar, linear mapping in his book Linear Geometry (1965). Functions of 2 √ó 2 real matrices The commutative subrings of M(2, R) determine the function theory; in particular the three types of subplanes have their own algebraic structures which set the value of algebraic expressions. Consideration of the square root function and the logarithm function serves to illustrate the constraints implied by the special properties of each type of subplane Pm described in the above profile. The concept of identity component of the group of units of Pm leads to the polar decomposition of elements of the group of units: *If mm = ‚àí, then z = œÅ exp(Œ∏m). *If mm = 0, then z = œÅ exp(s m) or z = ‚àíœÅ exp(s m). *If mm = , then z = œÅ exp(a m) or z = ‚àíœÅ exp(a m) or z = m œÅ exp(a m) or z = ‚àím œÅ exp(a m). In the first case exp(Œ∏ m) = cos(Œ∏) + m sin(Œ∏). In the case of the dual numbers exp(s m) = 1 + s m. Finally, in the case of split complex numbers there are four components in the group of units. The identity component is parameterized by œÅ and exp(a m) = cosh(a) + m sinh(a). Now \\\\sqrt{\\\\rho\\\\ \\\\exp(am)} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\rho}\\\\ \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}am\\\\right) regardless of the subplane Pm, but the argument of the function must be taken from the identity component of its group of units. Half the plane is lost in the case of the dual number structure; three- quarters of the plane must be excluded in the case of the split-complex number structure. Similarly, if œÅ exp(a m) is an element of the identity component of the group of units of a plane associated with matrix m, then the logarithm function results in a value log œÅ + a m. The domain of the logarithm function suffers the same constraints as does the square root function described above: half or three-quarters of Pm must be excluded in the cases mm = 0 or mm = . Further function theory can be seen in the article complex functions for the C structure, or in the article motor variable for the split-complex structure.  2 √ó 2 real matrices as complex numbers  Every real matrix can be interpreted as one of three types of (generalizedAnthony A. Harkin & Joseph B. Harkin (2004) Geometry of Generalized Complex Numbers, Mathematics Magazine 77(2):118‚Äì29) complex numbers: standard complex numbers, dual numbers, and split-complex numbers. Above, the algebra of matrices is profiled as a union of complex planes, all sharing the same real axis. These planes are presented as commutative subrings Pm. We can determine to which complex plane a given matrix belongs as follows and classify which kind of complex number that plane represents. Consider the matrix :z = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\end{pmatrix}. We seek the complex plane Pm containing z. As noted above, the square of the matrix z is diagonal when a + d = 0. The matrix z must be expressed as the sum of a multiple of the identity matrix and a matrix in the hyperplane a + d = 0. Projecting z alternately onto these subspaces of R4 yields :z = xI + n ,\\\\quad x = \\\\frac{a + d}{2}, \\\\quad n = z - xI. Furthermore, :n^2 = pI where p = \\\\frac{(a - d)^2}{4} + bc. Now z is one of three types of complex number: * If p < 0, then it is an ordinary complex number: *: Let q = 1/\\\\sqrt{-p}, \\\\quad m = qn. Then m^2 = -I, \\\\quad z = xI + m\\\\sqrt{-p}. * If p = 0, then it is the dual number: *: z = xI + n. *If p > 0, then z is a split- complex number: *: Let q = 1/\\\\sqrt{p}, \\\\quad m = qn. Then m^2 = +I, \\\\quad z = xI + m\\\\sqrt{p}. Similarly, a matrix can also be expressed in polar coordinates with the caveat that there are two connected components of the group of units in the dual number plane, and four components in the split-complex number plane. Projective group A given 2 √ó 2 real matrix with ad ‚â† bc acts on projective coordinates [x : y] of the real projective line P(R) as a linear fractional transformation: :[x : y] \\\\begin{pmatrix}a & c \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & d \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ = \\\\ [ax + by: \\\\ cx + dy]. When cx + dy = 0, the image point is the point at infinity, otherwise :[ax + by:\\\\ cx + dy] \\\\ \\\\thicksim \\\\left[\\\\frac{ax + by} {cx + dy} : \\\\ 1\\\\right] . Rather than acting on the plane as in the section above, a matrix acts on the projective line P(R), and all proportional matrices act the same way. Let p = ad ‚Äì bc ‚â† 0. Then :\\\\begin{pmatrix}a & c \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & d \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\times \\\\begin{pmatrix} d & -c \\\\\\\\\\\\ -b & a \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & p \\\\end{pmatrix} . The action of this matrix on the real projective line is :[x : y] \\\\begin{pmatrix}p & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & p \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ = \\\\ [px : py] \\\\thicksim [x : y] because of projective coordinates, so that the action is that of the identity mapping on the real projective line. Therefore, :\\\\begin{pmatrix}a & c \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & d \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ \\\\text{and} \\\\ \\\\begin{pmatrix} d & -c \\\\\\\\\\\\ -b & a \\\\end{pmatrix} act as multiplicative inverses. The projective group starts with the group of units GL(2,R) of M(2,R), and then relates two elements if they are proportional, since proportional actions on P(R) are identical: :PGL(2,R) = GL(2,R)/~ where ~ relates proportional matrices. Every element of the projective linear group PGL(2,R) is an equivalence class under ~ of proportional 2 √ó 2 real matrices.

The Northern Celestial Masters type of the Way of the Celestial Master () Daoist movement existed in the north of China during the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The Northern Celestial Masters were a continuation of the Way of the Celestial Masters as it had been practiced in Sichuan province by Zhang Lu and his followers. After the community was forced to relocate in 215 CE, a group of Celestial Masters established themselves in Northern China.Kohn (2000), p. 283. Kou Qianzhi, from a family who followed the Celestial Master, brought a new version of Celestial Master Daoism to the Northern Wei. The Northern Wei government embraced his form of Daoism and established it as the state religion, thereby creating a new Daoist theocracy that lasted until 450 CE.Kohn (2000), p. 284-285. The arrival of Buddhism had great influence on the Northern Celestial Masters, bringing monasticism and influencing the diet of practitioners. Art produced in areas dominated by the Northern Celestial Masters also began to show Buddhist influence. When the theocracy collapsed, many Daoists fled to Louguan, which quickly became an important religious center. The Northern Celestial Masters survived as a distinct school at Louguan until the late 7th century CE, when they became integrated into the wider Daoist movement. History =Northern Wei (424-450)= Kou Qianzhi was a member of Celestial Master family that came from an area near Chang'an. Inspired by the burgeoning Daoist movement in Southern China, Kou retreated to Mount Song in Henan to receive inspiration. On the mountain, as described by the text The History of the Wei Dynasty, he was visited twice by Laozi. In his first visit in 415, Laozi revealed to Kou a text known as the Laojun Yinsong Jiejing (New Code).Ware (1933), p. 228. This text contained precepts designed for a new religious community. In 423, a messenger of Laozi came and offered Kou a new text called the Lutu Zhenjing (Perfect Scripture of Registers and Charts), which is now lost, and appointed him as the new Celestial Master.Kohn (2000), p. 284. In 424, Kou took these texts with him to the Wei court. There, he was welcomed by Emperor Taiwu and garnered the support of Cui Hao, the prime minister. Even though Cui Hao was a Confucianist, he greatly admired Kou and was immediately drawn to him. Cui also appreciated Kou's mathematical skills and hoped that he might help him improve his own longevity techniques. They also shared a dream of a 'purified society,' a land where peace and justice prevailed.Mather (1979), p. 112-113. Kou's 'New Code' was promulgated throughout the realm, and a large altar was built near the capital where 120 Daoist practitioners performed rites and prayers daily. Cui gained a great deal of power in the court, and in 444 began to purge the Buddhist clergy. This led to a major persecution against Buddhists in 446.Mather (1979), p. 116-117. In 448, Kou Qianzhi was 'released' from his body, and Cui lost his greatest supporter at the court. Shortly after Kou's death, Cui had a national history of Wei dynasty containing unflattering portraits of its rulers carved in stone. This so enraged the emperor, that he had Cui executed in 450.Mather (1979), p. 120-121. After Cui's execution, the Daoist community was forced to flee, with many of them settling at the Daoist center of Louguan.Kohn (2000), p. 285. The entrance to the Louguan temple. =Louguan (450-688)= By the late 470s, Daoists fleeing from the Northern Wei court had transformed Louguan into an important religious center. According to legend, Louguan used to be the home of Yin Xi, the first recipient of the Dao de jing. At this time, the center's buildings were greatly expanded, and many Daoist scriptures were collected, including materials from the Lingbao and Shangqing schools.Kohn (2000), p. 286-287. During the 7th century, the school had a prominent role in a series of debates that examined whether Buddhism or Daoism would be better suited to bring stability to the realm. The first debate surrounded Fu Yi, a scholar and Daoist who proposed that Buddhism be abolished in China. Naturally, the Buddhists were not happy with his suggestions and countered his arguments in several treatises. The second debate concerned Lu Zhongqing, a friend of Fu Yi, who wrote about Buddhism's inferiority to Daoism. The Tang emperors were in support of the Daoists, and in 637 issued an edict that secured the precedence of Daoism over Buddhism. This edict remained in place until 674, when Empress Wu Zetian came to power. At the same time, Louguan also served as a refuge for Daoists fleeing the persecution of Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty to the south.Kohn (2008), p. 710. The final Northern Celestial Master, Yin Wencao arrived at Louguan in 636 and later achieved the favor of the Gaozong Emperor. After Yin's death in 688, Louguan remained an important place of Daoist learning, but ceased to be considered part of a distinct school.Kohn (2000), p. 289-290. Texts The most important text from the Northern Wei period of the Northern Celestial Masters is the Laojun Yinsong Jiejing (New Code). This text was revealed to Kou Qianzhi in 415, and is now mostly lost apart from a few fragments. The surviving text contains thirty-six precepts that outline rules which a Daoist had to abide by. The behavioral rules outlined proper public conduct and what to do in case of sickness. There were also guidelines describing how banquets were to be set up, as well ritual instructions concerning funeral rites, immortality practice and petitions.Kohn (2008), 609-610. One of the most important text's from the school's Louguan period is called the Xishengjing (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.Kohn (2008), 1135. Beliefs The Northern Celestial Master variety of Daoism was both similar and different from Zhang Lu's earlier form. Unlike prior incarnations of the Celestial Masters, which supported sexual practices as a means of achieving immortality, Kou's text urged that the sexual arts be purged from the religion.Despeux, (2000), 399. In addition, he also states that religion must be purged of the imposition of religious taxes on the faithful and the inheritance of religious titles. In the Northern Celestial Masters, Laozi became closely linked with the Buddha, who was claimed to be a student of Laozi.Kohn (2000), p. 299. There were also very specific dietary requirements that had to be followed, as well as other rules, many of which were influenced by Buddhism.Kohn (2000), p. 302. The Northern Celestial Masters were also the first Daoists to practice a form of monasticism, another idea that came from Buddhism. Kou also condemned messianic movements and called for texts such as the Daodejing to be copied and recited. Those people who were good in life would gain immortality in a new age, whereas those who were bad would be reborn as insects or animals.Robinet (1997), p. 76.Kohn (2000), p. 304. Laozi, depicted as the Taoist god. Some similarities between earlier Celestial Master Daoism include the role of Laozi. Laozi was viewed as the personification of the Dao, who existed for eternity and created the world. He was believed to be the creator of the universe and came to earth intermittently to bring forth sacred scriptures, including the Daode Jing and Xisheng Jing. Moreover, Laozi continued to appear periodically and bring forth new scriptures to both Kou Qianzhi and adherents at Louguan, surrounded by a celestial entourage and announced by a celestial envoy. Laozi was also extremely closely linked with the Buddha, and in certain sources, even became the Buddha or announced Yinxi as the Buddha.Kohn (2000), p. 298-299. Practices The Northern Celestial Masters followed certain regular, communal rites. One of these communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could last as long as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, leeks and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses ‚Äì wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.Toshiaki, (1995), 73. While monasticism had existed in Chinese Buddhism, the Northern Celestial Masters were one of the first Daoist groups to practice it. Kou lived a monastic lifestyle on Songshan, known today for being the location of the Shaolin Monastery.Goosseart (2008), p. 916. Monasticism developed further during the Louguan phase of the Northern Celestial Masters due to this influence of Buddhism. During this period, a clear distinction developed between lay and monastic followers in Daoism. The ordination, precepts and way in which monks sought salvation were all influenced by Buddhism. Art Many art objects were produced in Northern China during the time of the Northern Celestial Masters. These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The image of the god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side of a stone stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead, a wish for the happiness of family members or wishes for political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state.Kohn (2000), p. 303. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.Kohn and Lafargue (1998), p. 67.

Unlike most of the other installments of the series, this episode was not based on a novel by Bernard Cornwell. A key scene in the story is based on the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, reset here to Keighley in Yorkshire, in 1814. Plot It is 1814. There is peace in Europe as a defeated Napoleon is sent into exile on the island of Elba. Major Sharpe (Sean Bean) is assigned to head the Scarsdale Yeomanry in his native Yorkshire, depriving him of a chance to settle the score with his adulterous wife Jane (Abigail Cruttenden) and her lover, Lord Rossendale (Alexis Denisof). Sharpe and Regimental Sergeant Major Harper (Daragh O'Malley) are met on their arrival by George Wickham (Douglas Henshall), an officer in the Yeomanry. As he escorts them to town, they are ambushed and shot at. Sharpe pursues (but does not catch) one of the men, who turns out to be his close childhood friend, Matthew Truman (Philip Glenister). Wickham takes Sharpe to meet Sir Willoughby Parfitt (Tony Haygarth) and Sir Percy Stanwyck (Philip Anthony), wealthy businessmen who own many cotton mills between them. Parfitt tells Sharpe about the post-war unrest. The discharge of men from the army has flooded England with unemployed workmen; the increased competition and a reduced demand for cotton gives Parfitt an excuse to lower wages. He is opposed by Truman, a rabble rouser who stirs up the discontented, poverty- stricken masses. Meanwhile, the financially strapped Rossendale inherits an estate in neighbouring Lancashire. He had used his influence to get Sharpe posted as far from London as possible, but now has to relocate (with Jane) nearby. Both Rossendale and Jane speak with Sharpe separately, but nothing is resolved. Dan Hagman (John Tams), one of Sharpe's former riflemen, shows up looking for work, but turns down Sharpe's offer - nine years in uniform is enough for him. He becomes a follower of Truman. When Sharpe hears of an illegal meeting, he orders his soldiers to tread gently, but Wickham deliberately disobeys his orders and incites a massacre; Truman gets away in the confusion. However, Wickham cleverly manages to place all the blame on Sharpe. Sharpe visits Sally Bunting (Karen Meagher), a woman who had been kind to him in his childhood. From her, he learns that his mother is dead and also that Truman is his brother (or more likely half-brother). He arranges to meet with him at their mother's grave. Parfitt learns of it and sends Wickham to take them both. Sharpe, Harper and Hagman get away, but Truman is shot dead by Wickham. While in hiding, Sharpe is warned by Lady Anne Camoynes (Caroline Langrishe) that Parfitt and Wickham intend to secretly intercept and destroy a steam engine that Stanwyck is bringing in, in order to weaken his business rival. They intend to blame it on disaffected machine wreckers. Sharpe and his friends foil the scheme, catching Wickham red-handed. Sharpe uses this to blackmail Parfitt into clearing his name. In the end, Sharpe heads back to London, Harper to Ireland, while Hagman stays behind, having taken a liking to Sally.

Overview In this book Cohen and Stewart give their ideas on how the sentient human being evolved. Various chapters discuss scientific and philosophical ideas such as emergence and chaos, free will, perception versus reality, objectivity versus subjectivity, self-awareness, the ego and id, groupthink, and extelligence. A theme is that the traditional reductionist approach of trying to understand things as interaction of simpler things can not alone explain such complex concepts as intelligence or culture. To better understand them one has to consider also the context in which they have evolved and the fact that the evolution is a recursive process, often changing the context so that previously unseen evolutionary paths became available. The authors claim that intelligence is an inevitable result of letting evolution progress for long enough. Topics are illustrated with humorous science fiction snippets dealing with a hypothetical alien intelligence, the Zarathustrians, whom Cohen and Stewart use as metaphors of the human mind itself, an alternative evolution story, and various philosophical concepts.

He began as a seminarian at the Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum, and later switched to the Russicum.\\"Blessed Theodore Romzha\\", Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Passaic Romzha's life was a beautiful example of how different nationalities can live together. To all his priests he spoke in their native language, and he used his name in the form of T√≥dor in Hungarian texts. Theodore was ordained a priest there by Bishop Aleksander Evreinov on Christmas Day, 1936 in the Basilica of St Mary Major. After completing his compulsory military service he served briefly as a pastor in several Transcarpathian parishes (part of Czechoslovakia since 1918) before being assigned as professor of philosophy at the Eparchial Seminary in Ungv√°r (now Uzhhorod) in 1939, by then again part of Hungary. Episcopate These were difficult years for the Church in Subcarpathia as it experienced the re- annexion in 1938 by Hungary, as the result of the First Vienna Award, then direct invasion from Nazi Germany and lastly the Soviet Red Army. On 24 September 1944, at the young age of 33, he was consecrated bishop and appointed apostolic administrator of the Eparchy of Mukacheve in the cathedral of Uzhorod by Bishop Mikl√≥s Dud√°s, O.S.B.M., in co-consecration by J√°nos Scheffler (Hungarian Greek Catholic bishop of Szatm√°r), and Istv√°n Madar√°sz (Hungarian Greek Catholic bishop of Kassa). He immediately had to face the Soviet Red Army, which occupied the churches, assigned them to the Russian Orthodox Church and arrested their priests. Bishop Romzha refused to break with the Pope in front of General Petrov. He organized a celebration of the Feast of the Assumption with the participation of more than 80,000 pilgrims but this was not tolerated by the Communist officials who now began plotting to dispose of the young bishop. On 27 October 1947, on the way home from a parish visitation, Bishop Romzha's horse-drawn carriage was purposely rammed by a Soviet military truck and pushed off the side of the road. The soldiers, who were dressed as civilians, jumped from the truck and beat the bishop and his companions. Soon after the brutal assault began, a civilian truck came upon the scene and the assailants fled. Romzha and his companions were taken to Uzhhorod, where they were hospitalized. Romzha was making good progress when, late on the night of 31 October, the nuns who were nursing him were suddenly dismissed and a new nurse was assigned to him by the regime. A little after midnight Moscow Time, Romzha was found dead. The nurse had poisoned Romzha with an injection of curare provided by the head of NKVD Laboratory 12, Dr Grigory Mairanovsky.Vadim J. Birstein. The Perversion Of Knowledge: The True Story of Soviet Science. Westview Press (2004); According to research in Soviet archives by Yevgenia Albats, the Bishop's murder was personally ordered by Nikita Khrushchev.According to the KGB archives, \\"By order of Khrushchev,... Romzha, head of the Greek Catholic Church, who actively resisted the incorporation of the Greek Catholic Church into Russian Orthodoxy, was eliminated\\", from Yevgenia Albats and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia - Past, Present, and Future, 1994; , p. 33 On 4 November 1947, a large crowd attended Romzha's funeral, despite Soviet efforts to shut down and block public transportation. He was buried in the crypt of the Holy Cross Cathedral in Uzhhorod. The Ruthenian Catholic Church was relentlessly persecuted and in 1949, it was officially suppressed. All of its properties were allocated to the Russian Orthodox Church. Feast day and relics Tomb of Theodore Romzha Romzha was beatified as a Martyr for the Faith by Pope John Paul II in Lviv on 27 June 2001, with 1 November assigned initially as his feast day. At the request of the Eparchy of Mukacheve, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches transferred the feast day to 31 October, effective 2009. Romzha died shortly after midnight 1 November, according to Moscow Time, the Soviet-imposed time zone throughout Ukraine from 1930-1990; however, according to local time, Romzha died before midnight on 31 October. In 1998, the relics of Blessed Theodore were found in a tomb in the crypt of Holy Cross Cathedral in Uzhhorod, and then transported to Budapest, Hungary for medical examination. On 27-28 June 2003 his relics were translated and carried in solemn procession back to Uzhhorod, where they are enshrined in a side chapel at Holy Cross Cathedral. In commemoration of the event, a second feast day, the Translation of the Holy Relics of Blessed Theodore Romzha, is celebrated on 28 June. Notes Further reading Fr.

References below to a crew position are references to the occupation of these fictional characters on the show-within-a-show, which also is named The Larry Sanders Show. Show staff =Main characters= Larry Sanders Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Sanders (all seasons) (born December 19, 1950 in Mound, Minnesota, and a graduate of the University of Minnesota), played by Garry Shandling, is the host of The Larry Sanders Show, a late-night talk show that has been on the air since 1987, airing at 11:30 PM, five days a week, on an unnamed network. He is 42 years old (as of the 1993 episode \\"The Breakdown (Part One)\\"), then 43 years old (as of the 1993 episode \\"Larry's Birthday\\"). His father is named Jerry and his brother is named Stan. His wives were Francine and Jeannie, from both of whom he is now divorced; he was briefly engaged to Roseanne Barr. In the episode \\"The Garden Weasel\\", Larry shows his wife Jeannie a commercial that he did for Pan Am in 1979, in which he played a flight attendant. Also in the episode, Jeannie mentions that Larry once auditioned for the game show Make Me Laugh. In real life Shandling appeared on the show as a celebrity guest. In the episode \\"Larry's Partner\\", it is mentioned that Larry began his career as a standup comedian and as part of a double act with his friend Stan Paxton. Larry and Stan recorded a comedy album together and had a bit called \\"The Man on the Street Meets the Man on the Moon\\". Larry broke up his act with Stan 15 years ago because Stan had a serious drinking problem and only joined the business to \\"get laid\\". In the episode \\"The Promise\\", it is mentioned that Larry's first television appearance was on The Merv Griffin Show and that he later appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Also in the episode, Larry mentions that he discovered comedian David Spade while he was performing at the Comedy Store and gave him his first television appearance on his show. Spade went on to appear on the show at least six more times. Larry feels betrayed by Spade when he learns that Spade had appeared on The Tonight Show recently, but he forgives him when he recalls that he did the same thing by appearing on The Tonight Show after The Merv Griffin Show. In the episode \\"Out Of The Loop\\", Larry says he was a writer on Norm Crosby's Comedy Shop. Larry is neurotic and self-involved. He is uncomfortable with displays of emotion and dislikes confrontation, so much so that he often deploys Artie to fight his professional battles for him. He is also very insecure about his appearance: he is always concerned about the size of his \\"ass\\", which he thinks is too big, and he was unable to disguise his displeasure at Dana Carvey's impression of him in the show's fourth season. Larry enjoys watching his own show in bed every night, which is something that frustrates his second wife Jeannie. He is addicted to an unspecified type of painkiller (possibly multiple types of painkillers), and was previously addicted to marijuana. His personal life is often more dysfunctional than his professional life: he has been married and divorced twice, and he is shown to have trouble developing intimate bonds with other people and is estranged from his family. He dates many women, such as Mimi Rogers, Sharon Stone, Ellen DeGeneres, and Dana Delany, but these relationships never last and are often doomed by elements of Larry's celebrity or work life. The end of the series provided some hope for Larry; his decision to leave his show seemed to bring him a bit of perspective, and his relationship with Illeana Douglas appeared to be more substantial than his previous attempts at intimacy. Though Garry Shandling himself is not particularly sexually attractive in a conventional sense, the character Larry seems to be exceptionally sexually attractive within the show's universe. He is at one point named People Magazine's 10th sexist man alive and, as mentioned above, is shown to easily be able to sleep with various celebrities. Larry really likes frozen yogurt and often sends his assistant Beverly to get it for him. In the episode \\"The Breakdown (Part One)\\", it is mentioned that Larry and Hank first met in the spring of 1985. Larry does not respect Hank and thinks that Hank is not very bright. Larry constantly avoids Hank because he does not like dealing with him. However, Hank sometimes acts as a voice of reason for Larry and solves his problems for him, whether intentionally or not. Larry infrequently expresses an underlying affection for Hank, despite finding him intolerable (telling his wife-to-be that he \\"loves him\\" in the episode \\"Hank's Wedding\\"), and on occasion steps beyond his comfort zone for the sake of their friendship, for example cutting short his much needed vacation in order to attend the grand opening of Hank's 'Look Around Cafe' In the episode \\"The Grand Opening\\". Larry depends almost entirely upon Artie to protect him from the network executives and the unpleasant realities of show business. Larry claims he can't do the show without Artie because Artie is so loyal to him. In practice, Artie says what Larry finds too awkward or uncomfortable to say. Artie often colludes with Larry to achieve a desired end, and is the only person in Larry's professional life that can understand and connect with him. Artie's last name is never mentioned in any episode. The characterization of Artie is heavily inspired by Fred DeCordova, Johnny Carson's longtime producer. Francine is Larry's first wife, whom he begins dating again after Jeannie leaves him. Hank and Artie strongly dislike Francine. Larry's second wife, Jeannie, leaves him to go to Chicago because she thinks that he is too involved with the show. After she leaves him, Larry takes things very hard and has a minor heart episode. In the episode \\"Larry's Birthday\\", it is mentioned that Larry discovered Jerry when Jerry was performing at the comedy club Catch a Rising Star and hired him as the head writer for his show. Jerry was doing poorly as a comedian and was just about to quit the business before being hired. Due to budgetary reasons, Larry has to fire Jerry and he is unhappy with how bitter Jerry becomes after being fired. Larry becomes unhappy with his previous agent Leo, so he hires Stevie. Stevie is very obnoxious and Artie does not seem to like him very much. However, Stevie is good at what he does initially and he is able to negotiate Larry a very lucrative contract. Larry is impressed that Stevie represents many high-powered clients. In the episode \\"The Beginning of the End\\", Larry fires Stevie after finding out that he double-crossed him by becoming comedian Jon Stewart's agent. Stewart, at this point, is in a position to replace Larry on his talk show, and Stevie negotiates for Stewart rather than Larry before being fired. Grant is believed to be inspired by Ari Emanuel. Larry feels contempt for Melanie because he tends to dislike network executives. In the episode \\"The Garden Weasel\\", she makes him do live commercials on the show against his will. Larry gets into an argument with her afterwards, and she ends up assaulting him. Eventually, Larry once again has to rely on Artie to bluntly tell Melanie that he doesn't want to do the commercials. Hank Kingsley Hank Kingsley (all seasons) (born Henry Joseph Lepstein Jr.), played by Jeffrey Tambor, is the announcer and sidekick on The Larry Sanders Show, known for his \\"Hey now!\\" catchphrase (a takeoff on Ed McMahon's \\"Hi-yoooo!\\"). His father was Henry Joseph Kingsley, Sr., and he was married to Margaret Dolan, whom he later divorced. Hank worked as a cruise director when he met Larry, who befriended him and took him to the show. Hank is exceptionally fond of Larry, and it is implied on multiple occasions that Hank may harbor some form of romantic or physical attraction toward Larry. Though both Hank and Larry are narcissistic, they generally act as foils to one another. Larry is neurotic and evasive, while Hank is open and somewhat naive. While Larry's narcissistic personality sometimes results in positive outcomes for other characters, Hank's narcissism almost exclusively manifests itself in bullying. Unlike Larry, Hank is more than willing to lend his name to commercial products and tries to cultivate a cult of personality through his little-read newsletters, fan club, and so on. Hank tends to be dense and is frequently the butt of the jokes, often without realizing it. While McMahon built success beyond The Tonight Show as a commercial spokesman and TV host in his own right, Hank's desire to emulate McMahon was constantly foiled by his ego and bumbling attempts at self-aggrandizement. He is generally disrespected among his co-workers because of his ego and dimness. Hank will often act humble and unassuming, especially on camera or in front of media executives and other influential persons, but would become condescending and often quite nasty to anyone whom he perceives to be of a lower status. Hank spends considerable time furthering his career, often endorsing questionable products and working behind Larry's back to ensure his enduring presence on the show, even when Larry is being scrutinized. Hank is shown to be relatively untalented as an on-air personality. This becomes especially apparent in season six, in which it is continuously implied that Hank has no other opportunities after the show's end, as well as the first episode of the third season, in which Hank is forced to take a job reading lottery numbers for the local news. Though it is never explicitly stated, Hank seems as though he might be subtly aware of his inadequacy, causing him to amplify his bullying of coworkers. A running gag in the series involved Hank sending his assistant to tell Larry that he would like to speak with him, only to then approach Larry asking \\"You wanted to see me?\\" Artie described him once as someone who means well, but \\"keeps his brain at home in a box\\". In the final episode (\\"Flip,\\" original airdate 5/31/98), it is revealed that Hank offered his assistant Brian a job paying $300 a week ($476 in 2020 dollars) with no benefits, and that Brian was thinking of taking it. Artie \\"Artie\\" (all seasons), played by Rip Torn, is the producer of The Larry Sanders Show. His last name is never mentioned during the run of the show, but his full first name is Arthur. He has three sons named Eddie, Steve, and Cully, a grandfather named Jacob, and a mother named Adel. He has been married four times; his most recent wife is named Elaine. Artie is often shown drinking (typically either following a show taping or during a stressful situation), with his beverages of choice including vodka Salty Dogs and Glenlivet scotch whisky. Artie served in the Marine Corps during the Korean War. His first job in show business was as a bouncer. Artie's first job as a producer was on The Jackie Gleason Show, under producer Bob Sterling. He had replaced Sterling as producer after working on the show for six months. Artie also worked on The Jack Paar Show and The Dick Cavett Show during his career prior to becoming producer of The Larry Sanders Show. Artie is tough and very loyal to Larry, essentially taking on a fatherlike mentor role to Larry. He has a special ability to manipulate people into doing exactly what is best for the show. According to several interviews with both Rip Torn and series creator Garry Shandling, the character of Artie is largely based on long-serving TV and Film producer Fred De Cordova who produced (and eventually executive-produced) The Tonight Show for over twenty years, encompassing almost all of Johnny Carson's run as host including his iconic final broadcast. De Cordova himself guest-starred as himself in episode \\"Eight\\" and \\"As My Career Lay Dying\\". De Cordova reportedly presented Torn with a copy of the former's memoir, Johnny Came Lately: An Autobiography, inscribed \\"To the other Fred\\". Like most of the employees on the show, Artie has little respect for Hank and believes he makes a number of very poor decisions. However Artie is wise enough to understand the dynamic relationship between Larry and Hank, and is often looking out for him as a result (see Hank's Divorce Episode). Along with Hank, Artie strongly dislikes Larry's ex-wife Francine and is very unhappy when she gets back together with him; when Larry is with Francine, he does not put full effort into the show. Artie has never forgiven Francine for smashing Larry's People Choice Award. Artie dislikes all agents but he especially dislikes Stevie, Larry's sleazy and obnoxious agent, whom he slams against a wall for backstabbing Larry. Artie is very proud of Larry after he fires Stevie In the episode \\"The Beginning of the End\\". Artie, like Larry, dislikes most network executives; but unlike Larry, he is able to deal with them. Larry depends on Artie to deal with executive Melanie for him. Artie mentions several times that he thinks that he killed a man like Melanie in Korea. =Personal assistants= Beverly Barnes Beverly Barnes, played by Penny Johnson (all seasons), is Larry Sanders' personal assistant. Larry depends upon Beverly to do many simple tasks for him and she is very loyal to him. In the episode \\"The Breakdown (Part Two)\\", Beverly sleeps with Larry. Afterward, they both agree that it was a mistake to sleep together; however, in the episode \\"Office Romance\\" there is an implication that she still might have tender feelings for Larry when she abruptly leaves the office one day out of anger at his brief sexual relationship with Hank's secretary Darlene, saying, \\"Twice in one day is two times too many.\\" While respecting Larry and her mostly white co- workers, she sometimes expresses concern over what she feels is a lack of African Americans booked on the show. In \\"Beverly and the Prop Job\\" she even goes so far as to almost quit and work as the personal assistant to Laurence Fishburne after her cousin (played by Paul Mooney) convinces her that Larry's pushing of menial tasks on her (such as lacing up‚Äîbut not shining‚Äîhis shoes) makes Larry little more than a thinly-veiled slavemaster. But after talking with her father, she comes to the conclusion that Larry is \\"a wonderful guy\\", who also pays more money than Laurence Fishburne. Unrelated to her race, she also briefly resents Larry in the episode \\"Would You Do Me a Favor?\\" when she complains about him not appreciating all the work and help she provides for him. Beverly reveals she is pregnant in the episode \\"Beverly‚Äôs Secret\\", and her co-workers all place bets on who the father is. It is revealed that Eriq La Salle, one of the guests appearing on the show in the episode, is the father, after Larry, out of respect for Beverly, berates and insults Michael Bolton as he believes Bolton is the one who impregnated her only to then abandon her. Darlene Chapinni Darlene Chapinni, played by Linda Doucett, (seasons 1‚Äì3) was employed as sidekick Hank Kingsley's personal assistant for the first three seasons of the program. She quit her job as assistant (in episode two of season four) via a FedEx letter, informing Hank that she had chosen to follow a \\"holy man\\" in India. She is last seen in the final episode \\"Flip\\". After Darlene leaves, the personal assistant position is filled by Brian (whose last name is never given), played by Scott Thompson of The Kids in the Hall. Brian Brian, played by Scott Thompson, (seasons 4‚Äì6) is Hank's openly gay personal assistant, who replaces Darlene. Although Hank seemed uncomfortable at first, he is okay with Brian's orientation. In one episode, Hank is mistaken for being gay after a night on the town with his assistant. Upon being introduced to Hank, Brian said he was a \\"big fan\\" and quoted the introduction from a game show Hank had hosted, much to Hank's satisfaction. Like Darlene, Brian is loyal to Hank, and even offers Hank advice from time to time. In season 6, Brian threatens to sue the show for sexual harassment, after getting tired of Phil's gay jokes, but the suit is apparently called off after a surprising turn of events. In the final episode (\\"Flip,\\" original airdate 5/31/98), Brian tells Mary Lou that Hank offered him a job paying $300 a week ($476 in 2020 dollars) with no benefits, and he was thinking of taking it. =Writing staff= Jerry Capen Jerry Capen, played by Jeremy Piven, (seasons 1‚Äì2) is the show's head writer, but is fired from the show by Artie due to his promiscuous and consistently unprofessional nature in the episode \\"Larry's Birthday\\". His mother is named Shirley. Capen is first seen in the episode \\"The Promise\\". Phil Phil, played by Wallace Langham, (all seasons) is the show's head writer after Capen's departure. Phil's surname is never mentioned in the run of the series. He is the only character outside the main three to appear in every episode. The character Phil begins his career as a writer for The Larry Sanders Show under the then-head writer Jerry, played by Jeremy Piven. After Jerry was written off of the show, it went several episodes without having the head writer character. Phil then persuaded Artie to promote him to head writer and then wanted to demote himself because he felt that the work was not as enjoyable as it was before. Although Phil is quite young, he displays a bitterness that is rarely seen in young professionals. He dislikes when Larry and Artie criticize his writing and often feels unappreciated. He is a better writer when he is unhappy as seen when his girlfriend dumps him and Larry describes the monologue as never having been that good before. He is a Buddhist. At one point he leaves the show to develop a pilot for the network about a band from Seattle only to have his writing criticized by the network executives and by the future star of the show, Dave Chappelle, who says that Phil shouldn't be writing a \\"black show\\" even though it was never Phil's intention to write one. Phil frequently makes sexist and homophobic comments, and generally does not seem to like racial diversity on the show - mentioning that his Asian characters are often female because it is \\"killing two birds with one stone.\\" In the season five episode \\"The New Writer,\\" Phil uses his role as the head writer to intentionally suppress Wendy's jokes in order to make her seem untalented, claiming that \\"women aren't funny.\\" Wendy Traston Wendy Traston, played by Sarah Silverman, (seasons 5‚Äì6) is brought on as a staff writer in the episode \\"The New Writer\\". However, her jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the head writer, Phil, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers. She appeared in several episodes during the last two seasons. Mike Patterson Michael \\"Mike\\" Patterson is a writer played by John Riggi (seasons 1‚Äì3) who is brought on as a staff writer on The Larry Sanders Show before Jerry is fired. Patterson is first seen in the episode \\"Larry's Birthday\\", and last seen in the episode \\"Headwriter\\". Patterson was created by Maya Forbes. =Talent bookers= Paula Paula, played by Janeane Garofalo, (seasons 1‚Äì5) is the show's talent booker (although another character, Kiki, is shown as the talent booker in the season 2 episode \\"Performance Artist\\"). Throughout the run of the series, her last name is never mentioned. She has a very dry sense of humor and cringes at any display of sentimentality. In the second-season episode \\"Artie's Gone\\", Arthur trusts her to produce the show on her own. In the episode \\"Montana\\", as Larry is trying to assemble the former show staffers for another kick at the can after his sabbatical, he asks Paula if she'd be interested in continuing at her old job. She says that she has an offer to be the associate producer on the Conan O'Brien Show. Larry's response comes in the form of a question: \\"I can understand why you'd want to take the Conan O'Brien job over this one. It's a good sh... How long do you think that's going to stay on the air?\\", to which frightened Paula replies: \\"See you Monday\\". However, Paula's second stint with the show is not without problems as Larry comes very close to firing her in the episode \\"The Gift Episode\\" after several high-profile guests pull out of the commitment despite being already booked. In a conversation with Artie, Larry expresses a personal opinion that Paula isn't right for the job \\"because she doesn't have the right personality\\". He goes on to state that \\"she's too....\\", but before Larry can finish, Artie interjects with three offerings \\"abrasive?\\", \\"brusque?\\", and \\"incapable of putting a performer at ease because she has a basic contempt for the business?\\". Larry's answer is a vehement \\"no\\" after each of the first two, and a strong \\"yes\\" after the third one. In the episode \\"The Matchmaker\\", she gets an inexperienced assistant, Mary Lou Collins, who makes frequent mistakes in research notes for Larry's interviews leading to several on-air embarrassing situations during the Nicollette Sheridan segment. Paula last appears in \\"Pain Equals Funny\\". After performing the booking job for five years, she gets an offer to be the producer on a daytime program Caryl & Marilyn: Real Friends. On one hand, she is not thrilled about going to daytime, but on the other, it's the realization of her dream to one day produce. Also, as she tells Larry about her present job while informing him that she's leaving: \\"I can only derive a limited amount of personal satisfaction from booking the parrot lady\\". Larry wants to keep her and immediately offers her a promotion to produce The Larry Sanders Show. According to how Larry envisioned her promotion right there on the spot, she'd be working under the show's longtime executive producer Artie, which she ecstatically accepts. However, the arrangement quickly turns sour as Artie, already feeling disrespected and threatened by the whole proceeding, walks off the show following a disagreement with Paula over a production issue of lighting during which Larry takes her side. Faced with a sudden crisis, Larry lets her produce that day's show by herself, before summoning her to his office to inform her that the arrangement won't work and ask her to see if the daytime job is still open. On the same occasion, he lets her know how much he's always liked her, basically coming on to her, and also expressing hope that once all has settled down they can maybe go out. Angry and flattered at the same time, perplexed Paula says that she's never been fired this way. As she's packing her stuff the next day, Artie approaches Paula at her desk and after imparting some words of wisdom from his long experience being a producer says that there are still some tricks that he could teach her, meaning that he had a change of heart and is now fine with her working alongside him. However, the very next day after seeing her in the office, Larry is now unhappy to learn about the new turn because as he says to Artie: \\"I never would've told her I liked her if I'd known she was staying\\". This was the last time the character of Paula appeared on the show. In the canon of the show, it is unclear whether the character of Paula remained employed or was later dismissed. The supporting cast in general is featured less in the sixth season, so it is conceivable that, in the show's universe, the character of Paula is still employed during this time but is simply never shown. Mary Lou Collins Mary Lou Collins, played by Mary Lynn Rajskub, (seasons 5‚Äì6) is an assistant talent booker. Working under Paula, she frequently makes mistakes in researching the celebrities, which led to Larry looking foolish on air. However, Mary Lou eventually became more competent in the position and fills Paula's shoes. Outside of her role as a talent booker, Mary Lou is frequently shown to be socially inept and have very low IQ. In season 6's The Interview, Mary Lou accidentally hits Hank's car, but has difficulty confessing this to him. As a result, Hank misunderstands her confession attempts as her having a crush on him, and invites her to dinner. Mary Lou confides in Beverly that she's attracted to sensitive men (which Hank is far from), and later tries to subtly rebuff every move Hank makes on her. However, when Hank breaks down while watching Larry being interviewed on Extra (TV series), Mary Lou finds herself attracted to him. Kiki Rosatti Kiki Rosatti, played by Maureen Mueller, (season 2) is shown as head booker in the episode \\"Performance Artist\\". =Cue card= Sid Sid, played by Sid Newman (all seasons), holds the cue cards for Larry during the show. He dies by suicide in the last season, with Hank blaming himself. Professional associates =Agents= Leo Leo is Larry's longtime agent, played by John Pleshette (season 2). He gets dumped by Larry in the middle of contract negotiations as Larry decides to pursue a big-money contract with the help of high-powered agent Stevie Grant. Leo is introduced as a good-natured, personable individual whom Larry socializes with outside of work. Although generally happy with Leo's representation, Larry wants to go after \\"the Letterman money\\" in the latest contract negotiations as he feels he deserves it after doing the show for six years. However, he can hardly hide his disappointment with the latest offer Leo comes back with after lunch with the network's head of business affairs. Leo explains that Letterman had to leave a network in order to get the kind of money Larry wants, while Larry insists that \\"we can do better\\". Asked by Leo how much better, perplexed Larry says \\"I want you to tell me\\" before Leo whispers another figure into his ear to which Larry immediately starts shaking his head in disappointment followed by an instruction to Leo to pass on the network's latest official offer. As he departs, Leo good-naturedly asks him \\"how much of a fight do you want to put up here\\", to which already somewhat irritated Larry responds \\"I don't want a fight, Leo, I want you to fight\\". A couple of days later, Larry goes out to lunch with Stevie Grant and decides to sign with him, thus dumping Leo. Leo is predictably devastated when broken the news at Larry's home during a dinner also attended by Artie and Francine, while Larry maintains this is strictly a business decision and doesn't want Leo to take it personally. Leo naturally does and their longtime friendship gets ruined. Stevie Grant Steven \\"Stevie\\" Grant is Larry's obnoxious agent, played by Bob Odenkirk (seasons 2‚Äì6). High-strung and cajoling, he often uses a combination of profane and ostentatious language to punctuate his points. His appearances on the show are always accompanied by great turmoil and tension, such as contract negotiations, network sale, walk-off threats, and new host takeovers. Unlike with his previous agent Leo, Larry maintains a strictly professional relationship with Stevie, without any socializing. Stevie, a young aggressive hot-shot Hollywood agent on the way up, is introduced in the episode \\"Larry's Agent\\" as Larry's contract is being renegotiated by his longtime agent and friend ‚Äî Leo. Seemingly unrelated to the ongoing renegotiation, Stevie stops by the show and greets Artie and Larry backstage following the director Barry Levinson's segment on the show. Stevie says he's only there to \\"hold Levinson's hand\\" because he signed him the previous week, but doesn't miss an opportunity to inquire about the contract renegotiation while encouraging Larry to keep on by telling him he's \\"got the network by the balls\\". Stevie then suddenly leans in and says: \\"Hey, if Leo's having a hard time with this thing, I sure would like to take a shot\\", to which somewhat flattered Larry politely replies that Leo's got it covered. As Stevie leaves, Artie expresses displeasure at Stevie failing to shake his offered hand at the beginning of the brief encounter while slightly impressed Larry says he thinks Stevie is the next Michael Ovitz. Despite Larry's denials, Artie is already sensing he wants to fire Leo and lets him know as much in front of his girlfriend Francine, who even frowns upon the very thought. Soon, however, Larry has lunch with Stevie Grant at Spago and afterward informs him that he's signing with him. Stevie immediately goes in very aggressively at the network. After running into one another at the elevator, Larry is informed by the network president Sheldon Davidoff that Stevie drives an extremely tough bargain. Sheldon also tells him he's surprised Larry would be willing to leave the network and move the show to New York City, all of which Larry hears about for the first time, but plays coy anyway despite just realizing Stevie threw that bluff without even consulting him. Sheldon concludes the brief conversation by saying: \\"That Stevie Grant has no fears\\", before trailing off: \\"Oh well, it isn't his career he's playing with\\". Larry immediately confronts his new agent for performing such a stunt without keeping him in the loop, but Stevie reassures him it's all about the leverage, telling Larry he'd even be willing to take the syndication deal from King World if he doesn't get the money from the network. Rapidly cooling on Stevie's punch-in-the-gut style, scared Larry confides in Artie that \\"Stevie Grant is totally out of fucking control\\". The thing that makes Larry finally decide to dump Stevie is a conversation in which he pushes the New York thing like a real possibility because his agency apparently has a good relationship with King World, and \\"King World is sweet on New York\\". Talking things over with Artie at the office again, Larry calls his new agent \\"a prick\\", \\"a liar\\", \\"two-faced\\", and \\"weird\\" just as Stevie is coming into the room with a new offer from the network written on a piece of paper. Artie excuses himself from the room, while Larry is so sick of everything that he's determined to break things off with Stevie right there before even hearing the offer. As he's delivering his \\"Listen, Stevie, I've been thinking about a lot of things....\\" spiel, Stevie hands him the piece of paper and Larry glances at it after a few moments but crucially before getting to the gist of his speech already in progress. Obviously ecstatic with the offered figure, Larry does a complete turnaround on the spot and decides not to get rid of Stevie. Stevie's next appearance is in the episode \\"L.A. or N.Y.?\\", which was the second season's finale. After meeting Richard \\"Dick\\" Jermaine who represents the foreign beer producer that's about to buy the network, Larry is so displeased with the overall vibe he gets from the man and particularly with his idea to overhaul the show into a \\"late night news magazine wrap-up of the day's events with a hip MTV sensibility\\" that he immediately contacts Stevie about his options to leave, citing his inability to work for \\"this fucking beer nut\\" as the reason. Stevie's immediate reaction is one of rehearsed loud jubilation: \\"Yesss, fuck that beer baron! We're fuckin' outta here!\\" Upon being told by Larry to keep it down, Stevie apologizes by saying \\"I live for this shit. It gets me all hot and wet.\\" Stevie then informs Larry that he had already talked to Ted Harbert at ABC where according to Stevie \\"they'd kill their grandmothers\\" to have the New Larry Sanders Show After Nightline, which, as he adds, is \\"unfortunately the title they want to use\\". In addition to all of the above, Stevie informs Larry that the ABC people want him to do the show from New York City instead of L.A.. Larry is receptive to all of it except for the move to NYC that at one point even prompts him to deliver his by now usual threat of moving to Montana, which Stevie takes half-jokingly by quipping it would make a great sitcom. Faced with a difficult decision under severe pressure from his girlfriend Francine as well as the show's staff who are scared for their jobs, Larry is soon informed by Stevie that the ABC deal is almost locked up and is shown a one-year contract figure. Unhappy with the lack of a long-term commitment on ABC's part, Larry wonders out loud to Stevie \\"if Harvard is such a big fan, how come the deal is only for a year\\". In his retort, Stevie flippantly points out that \\"these guys never last\\", adding: \\"he'll be out of a job within a year and we'll renegotiate\\". Larry doesn't like any of it, while Stevie attempts to reassure him: \\"Larry, don't micromanage, let me handle the details\\". Larry's response verges on anger: \\"You know what your problem is, Stevie? You're talking to me like you think I believe you\\" before he goes on stage to do a show at the end of which he announces his retirement and intention to spend the rest of his life in Montana. In the episode \\"People's Choice\\" Stevie is livid after finding out Larry agreed to host the People's Choice Awards as a favor to Artie, who is producing this year. Stevie is beside himself that Larry made a decision without consulting him. Instead of hosting by himself, which is what he thought he was agreeing to, Larry is angrily informed by Stevie that he actually agreed to co-host with Rita Moreno and Dean Cain. To further drive his point home Stevie makes Larry repeat the following out loud: \\"Co-hosting detracts from my essential specialness in the marketplace\\". When Larry gets addicted to painkillers in the episode \\"End of the Season\\", thus missing a week of shows and forcing the staff to call Pat Sajak into guest-hosting action, he's cared for at his home by old friend Roseanne Barr, and Stevie pays him a visit with a fruit basket in tow. However, while talking to Larry alone, Stevie's much more interested in Roseanne's agent situation at the rival William Morris Agency - at one point even asking Larry whether he knows if she's happy with the representation over there. As jittery and distracted Larry reaches for the wrapped-up fruit basket on the table, Stevie informs him that it's actually for Roseanne while also telling him that his basket won't be ready until tomorrow because \\"you like that sugar-free shit, right\\". In the episode \\"Conflict of Interest\\", Stevie starts dating the Larry Sanders Show talent booker Paula, which soon raises suspicion among the staff that he's only doing it in order to use their relationship as a way to get his lesser-known clients such as Ed Begley, Jr., Sally Struthers, Jake Johansen, and Andy Kindler booked on the show. He is first seen in the episode \\"Larry's Agent\\", and was created by Garry Shandling, Paul Simms, Maya Forbes, and Drake Sather. Sid Bessel Sid Bessel, played by Phil Leeds (seasons 3‚Äì4) is Hank's agent, an elderly Jewish American out of step with modern showbusiness. Hank seems to be aware of Sid's inadequacies and is excited to sign with another agent when he thinks Sid is dying. However Hank never fires Sid, which is one of the few instances in which Hank is implied to have any type of empathy. =Publicists= Norman Litkey Norman Litkey is Larry's publicist throughout the series, played by David Paymer (seasons 1, 3, 5, 6). He's a bald, slightly neurotic showbiz insider who seemingly derives enormous amounts of personal satisfaction from exploiting anything and everything for publicity purposes. Norman makes his first appearance in the episode \\"A Brush with the Elbow of Greatness\\" in order to handle the fallout following an incident involving Larry that occurred at a supermarket in Larchmont Village. Local newscast runs a piece in which shopper named Carol Biederman accuses Larry of knocking her into a magazine rack by pushing in front of her in the checkout line. Larry doesn't remember doing any such thing and maintains his innocence saying he only recalls having a splitting headache that night and quickly running into the supermarket to get some Excedrin and artichokes. Naturally, due to Larry's celebrity, the story generates some media interest that quickly goes into overdrive once the supermarket's security camera footage suddenly surfaces. The tape is obtained by Entertainment Tonight, however, Artie gets a copy before it airs and watches it with Larry thus realizing that contrary to Larry's recollection, the late-night star clearly did bump this woman into a rack. Depressed about the tape airing in a few hours, they summon publicity man Norman Litkey who's surprisingly cheerful about what happened, referring to it as \\"publicity bonanza\\" and repeatedly exclaiming in delight: \\"Gentlemen, I'm wetting myself\\" (a phrase he says throughout the series, whenever he gets excited). Norman mentions to Larry that instead of publicly apologizing to Ms. Biederman like she demanded, thereby immediately nipping the whole thing in the bud, he should ride the wave of publicity and enjoy the increased viewership this extra attention will surely bring. Or as Norman puts it: \\"let's not kill this cow before we've milked it\\", before drawing comparisons to the 1990 Roseanne Barr national anthem incident at a baseball game that projected her show from number twelve to number one in the viewership ratings. Reluctantly, Larry agrees to hold off the apology and see how the thing plays out over the next few days. Depressed from the relentless beating he's taking in the media for what he did, Larry spends most of his time locked in his office saying he wants to quit show business and move to Montana. He finally reaches a point where he can't take it any longer and decides to apologize. Norman supports his decision, seeing it now as \\"the right, human, and only thing to do\\", however, in order to maximize the publicity effect he suggests Larry do it by having the woman on the show, which Larry reluctantly agrees to again. Norman makes a comeback when Larry and Sharon Stone begin to date, looking to exploit his client's relationship with a major Hollywood star for publicity. His advice to Larry is to \\"get his head right in close to Sharon\\" when the paparazzi are taking her photos outside of restaurants. As Larry is rolling his eyes at the suggestion, Norman proceeds to explain \\"the second law of thermodynamics\\" to his client: \\"heat always passes from a hotter body to a cooler body, and never the other way around ‚Äî see, you're getting her heat, and that means the show is getting heat, and that means my kids will eat\\". Surprised Larry asks: \\"You have kids?\\", to which Norman has a ready retort: \\"There're some kids in my neighborhood, who gives a shit\\". He is first seen in the episode \\"A Brush with the Elbow of Greatness\\", and was created by Maya Forbes & Peter Tolan. =Network executives= Dennis Dennis (seasons 2‚Äì5) is a network executive in his forties played by Doug Ballard who favors the idea of cutting costs by replacing Larry with a new host, which would enable the network to dump Larry's huge salary. Dennis's first appearance took place during \\"Life Behind Larry\\" where he was one of the two executives involved with filling the 12:35 am spot after Larry's show (the other one being Melanie Parrish). Two of them suggested Bob Saget and Dave Coulier while Larry pushed for Bobcat Goldthwait only to see the job eventually go to Tom Snyder. In the episode \\"Larry's on Vacation\\" (season 4 finale) while he and a fellow executive Melanie Parish discuss guest host Sandra Bernhard's ratings vs. Larry's, Dennis is the first to put forth the idea of replacing their highly paid star. He reasons that since Sandra Bernhard is able to pull the same audience share as Larry and also get a younger demographic, the network would save a lot by bringing in a fresh face that would be willing to work for much less than Larry's current salary. Asked by somewhat surprised Melanie if he specifically wants Sandra to become the new host, Dennis says that it could be anybody (Jon Stewart, Rosie O'Donnell, etc.). In the next episode, as Jon Stewart gets ready to guest-host another week, Dennis, backed up by Melanie, says to Artie that they want to bring Jon in as the permanent guest host or as he puts it: \\"we want to make sure we have a backup quarterback\\". Dennis is first seen in the episode \\"Life Behind Larry\\" and last seen in the episode \\"Everybody Loves Larry\\". He was created by Peter Tolan. Kenny Mitchell Kenny Mitchell (seasons 2 and 6) is a network executive in his thirties played by Joshua Malina who is brought in to administer major changes to the Larry Sanders Show in order to make it appeal to a younger demographic. Kenny is first introduced tagging along with Roger Bingham, when they drop into Larry's office unannounced in order to talk to him about \\"doing a little fine-tuning to get the numbers up\\" since he's losing to Keenan in certain key cities. To that end, Kenny starts to inform Larry and Artie about the ideas/suggestions that the network's research department has come up with (a more enthusiastic Leno-type opening with running through the audience and shaking their hands, different hairstyle for Larry), but is repeatedly interrupted by an uninterested Larry. As the fifth and last suggestion/idea, Kenny lists a snappier theme song at which point he plays a tape with the funky number done by \\"the guy who did the Singled Out theme\\". Very soon afterward, Kenny gets assigned to the show as the creative consultant to oversee the implementation of the various changes. Not surprisingly, right from the start, he's despised by everyone, especially Artie who calls him a \\"pimple-faced chaperone\\". When Kenny crudely insults the show to Artie's face, Artie physically assaults Kenny. Mitchell is first seen in the episode \\"Another List\\" and last seen in the episode \\"Adolf Hankler\\". Melanie Parrish Melanie Parrish (all seasons), a woman in her forties, is the Vice President of Programming played by Deborah May who often gets into conflicts with Larry. In the episode \\"The Garden Weasel\\", it is mentioned that Melanie has recently been made the Vice President of Programming at the network, which means she is in charge of late night programming. Also in the episode, Melanie forces Larry to begin performing live commercials for products that sponsor the show. Larry tries to get out of it and ends up being hit in the face by Melanie. Melanie is tough and often uses foul language to prove her point. Artie mentions that Melanie reminds him of a man that he killed in Korea. She is last seen in the episode \\"Adolf Hankler\\". Parrish's character was created by Peter Tolan. Roger Bingham Roger Bingham (seasons 5‚Äì6) is a slick network executive in his mid-to-late thirties, played by Bruce Greenwood, who favours Jon Stewart to be the host over Larry. Roger is first mentioned by another network executive, Dennis, during \\"Everybody Loves Larry\\" as being someone who \\"feels very strongly about Jon Stewart\\". Roger's first actual appearance on the show is in the episode \\"Larry's New Love\\" when he steps in along with Kenny Mitchell to retool the Larry Sanders Show after it starts to slip in the ratings. Bingham is first seen in the episode \\"Larry's New Love\\", and last seen in the episode \\"The Beginning of the End\\". Sheldon Davidoff Sheldon \\"Shel\\" Davidoff (seasons 1‚Äì2) is the president of the network, played by James Karen. He is close friends with Artie and they associate together outside of work. An old school executive, Sheldon carries himself in dignified manner, never swearing or raising his voice around the office. In stark contrast to other executives at \\"the network\\", he seems to displays genuine care and compassion for the people he deals with at work. Davidoff's character was created by Peter Tolan, and is last seen in the episode \\"Larry's Agent\\". Larry's wives =Jeannie Sanders= Jeannie Sanders, played by Megan Gallagher (seasons 1 and 4), is married to Larry in the first season, during which they begin the process of divorce. =Francine Sanders= Francine Sanders, played by Kathryn Harrold (season 2), is a reporter. She was married to Larry prior to the events of The Larry Sanders Show; they briefly rekindle their relationship after he and Jeannie split up.

The United States deployed the 74th Air Control Squadron to Kuwait on August 24, 1995. The specific battle management functions the 74th Air Control Squadron and its counterparts performed included surveillance, data link management and weapons control. The deploying units were part of a ground theater air control system, consisting of a control reporting element and an air support operations center. The US then deployed 3,500 soldiers to Kuwait in October 1996 as a deterrent to further hostile Iraqi acts toward Kuwait following the expansion of the Iraqi no-fly zones. Third Army/ARCENT provided command and control for a rapid deployment of a heavy brigade task force. Once more, Iraqi threats were decisively met while ARCENT simultaneously conducted a major training exercise in Egypt, codenamed \\"BRIGHT STAR 95,\\" involving military forces from 6 other nations. This contingency operation validated critical procedures for deployment, particularly the off-loading of equipment from floating prepositioning ships and its distribution to arriving soldiers. The deployment of a \\"Fly-Away Package\\" of key contingency staff also validated procedures for a rapidly deployed command and control group able to conduct combat operations immediately upon arrival. United States Navy and US Marine Corps combat forces (15th MEU) and active and reserve Military Sealift Command forces responded to Iraqi threats against Jordan and Kuwait. Maritime Pre-positioning Ship Squadron Two sortied from Diego Garcia with equipment for a 17,300-Marine combat force and remained on-station to provide rapid response capability. Operation Vigilant Sentinel's response quickly convinced Saddam Hussein to withdraw his forces from the Kuwaiti border.

The purchase of the Climax Racing studio, developer of most of the previous titles in the series, from Climax Studios by Disney Interactive Studios led to speculation over who would be developing the game. However, a promo video on the Xbox Live Marketplace confirmed that Climax Studios were still involved in MotoGP '07. Features MotoGP '07 features complete rider and team data, new 800cc MotoGP bikes and all 18 circuit of the 2007 MotoGP season. The title also features interactive track-side crowds, on-line tournament features, on-line \\"pink slip\\" racing, and a revamped Extreme mode. The revamped Extreme mode allows for over one million possible bike customizations. In addition, minor gameplay changes have been made to the handling and braking to allow for easier player accessibility. Changes to acceleration and deceleration have been made to add to the realism which will make turns easier to navigate through. Slight fishtailing with hard braking has been put in to give a better feel for the handling of the bike and to let the player know how effective their braking is. Also, the ability of the player to customise their bikes is greatly increased. In Extreme mode the player can upgrade their bike with various performance modifications: carbon brakes, race exhausts, magnesium/carbon wheels etc. In Grand Prix mode, the customisation is limited to visual upgrades, though MotoGP'07 now allows players greater control over the appearance of their bike. Despite this, some players have complained that the visual modifications are still fairly restrictive - the main criticism is that the custom paintwork option still restricts the player to the same limited amount of customisation as the previous games, despite the fact that the overall visual modification option has been overhauled. This leaves the player unable to design or customise the paint on their bike to approximate the level of design detail achieved by other AI racers.. Whether this issue will be resolved in future patches is not known. In addition to this the PC version of the game features a corrupt model of the Yamaha M1 with the rear cowling misformed visible on Rossi and Edwards' bikes. Also the crowds in grandstands no longer work with post 2010's graphics drivers on the PC and shimmer. =Ilmor GP= The game features Ilmor GP to ride but in real life Ilmor rider Jeremy McWilliams crashed before the first Round of the season in Qatar, resulting in him not being able to take part in the race. Andrew Pitt, the second Rider, raced alone. Ilmor GP does not appear in more races since Ilmor retired from the 2007 Championship after the first GP in Qatar. However, Jeremy McWilliams and Andrew Pitt and the Ilmor GP bike are available to use as a playable driver and bike in the championship mode and race mode and in the quick races. In championship mode, the Ilmor GP team was removed to avoid running against them. In sports race, the player can use the Ilmor GP team to customize it and play with it but like the championship mode, the Ilmor GP team is removed from it. In quick race, one rider IA is replaced random for Andrew Pitt, since the game only has 19 bikes at a time, 20 bikes for the sports race mode. Release MotoGP '07 had a somewhat protracted release in the United Kingdom. While the Xbox release proceeded as planned, the PC version was delayed twice: originally delayed until the first week of September, and then delayed again until the eventual release date of September 28. Reception The Xbox 360 version received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the PC version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

The cards of the minor arcana are considered to be lesser compared to the major arcana because they discuss the minor mysteries of life, less important archetypes. Modern Tarot readers interpret the Ace of Wands as a symbol of optimism and invention. Introduction Tarot's pictorial symbolism embodies intellectual, moral, and spiritual ‚Äòlessons‚Äô constituting collective human experiences across times, places and cultures. Tarot establishes this much sought after connection between ‚Äòself‚Äô and ‚Äòother‚Äô akin to the famous ‚ÄòI-Thou‚Äô relation in Martin Buber‚Äôs metaphysics. The ace card in a deck is considered the trump card. This card in a reading signifies success in all aspects. The success is backed by luck. This combination of success backed by hard work and luck is what forms the basis of the Ace card in the Tarot deck. The element of the wands suit is fire. The key words are Passion, New Ventures, Success, good luck. Therefore, wands are enthusiastic, inspirational, and spiritually minded. Wands correspond to the zodiac signs Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. The four suits, related to the modern hearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades, are swords, cups, pentacles, and wands.Shepard A., Leslie (1991) Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology, Third Edition, Volume 2, . An Ace-Ace pair shows that a new spirit is entering one's life. It draws on the energy of the Ace of Wands: creativity, excitement, adventure, courage, personal power. History The Minor Arcana consists of the suit cards. The leading French occultist of the late 19th and 20th centuries, who wrote under the name of Papus, rebuked certain of his colleagues for using only the major Arcana for divination, and insisted that the entire pack is essential; and all occult theories of those whom Papus rebuked were in better accord than he with the true facts of the matter. The suit cards are in no way special to the tarot pack; its inventor can have imbued it at most the trump card with esoteric meanings, since the others were not of his invention, but only rather faithful copies of the Islamic cards from which European ones were derived.Decker, Ronald, Thierry Depaulis, and Michael Dummett (1996) A Wicked Pack of Cards: The Origins of the Occult Tarot, p. 38.

Card Description/Mythological Image There are different versions of the Ace of Wands as well as different interpretations of their meaning. One is that a hand comes out from a cloud holding a flowering wand. In the distance is a mountain peak surmounted by a castle.Gray, Eden (1879) The Tarot Revealed: A Modern Guide to Reading Tarot Cards, p. 13. Another says that the image found on the Ace of Wands card is the rod with which Moses used to strike the water out of the rock or the club of Hercules.Banzhaf, Hajo (1993) The Tarot Handbook, p. 62-63. How the Ace of Wands relates to Life =Upright= When the Ace of Wands appears upright, readers often interpret a call for creativity and ambition. =Reversed= If the Ace of Wands appears reversed, it is often taken as circumstances delaying progress.http://www.discover-the- meaning-of-tarot.com/ace-of-wands.html =Work= Tarot readers often interpret the Ace of Wands as a sign of new and positive future, especially in the area of occupation. =Love= If the reader is single, this card may be seen as the indication of the beginning of a new romantic relationship. If one is already committed, the Ace tells that the relationship will undergo a 'new beginning,' and those in it will rise to new levels of understanding each other. =Finances= The appearance of this card has been interpreted as the sign of a turn for the better in terms of fortune and wealth, and sometimes it can even indicate gifts of money, or inheritance from unexpected sources. =Health= Readers often see this card as alluding to new, positive levels of health and vitality. =Spirituality= As mind and body are closely linked, this card can indicate a new spiritual influence coming into one's life. Key symbols to the ace of wands Tarot card meanings Clouds: Symbol meaning of clouds deal with ambiguity, mystery, and things hidden. Most renditions of this card depict a hand holding a flaming torch thrust out suddenly from the clouds. This is symbolic of our ideas or energy coming out of the hidden places of our psyche and into the light of day. Clouds often deal with hidden agendas that might be keeping us in a holding pattern. They may also indicate underlying beliefs that hold us back from our being our brightest selves. Rivers: River symbol meanings deal with motion, direction, and the flow of our thoughts as well as our lives. When the river in the ace of wands Tarot card flows into our psychic vision it is a message that we must consider the direction we are taking in our lives. Specifically, since the ace of wands deals with passion and energy, we may want to consider where our actions are taking us. Take the time to reassess one's goals and be confident one is heading in the life direction desired. Mountains: Symbol meanings of mountains deal with challenges, acquisition, accomplishment and aspirations. Mountains are a symbolic allegory for us in that as we climb them, each step brings us closer to our highest point. This highest point, the top of the mountain, can be a spiritual goal, physical goal, or anything else that we aspire to reach. The mountain is unbending, and inflexible. This makes it a reminder that only we can change how we deal with challenges (because the mountain certainly isn't going to change for us). This being the case, we can embrace the lessons we gain as we take on the challenge of the mountain. We can also rest assured that the peak will always be there as we aspire ever higher to our desired results. Extras In some cases, tarot can also be made into art. London's Spill Festival which was from April 18 to 24, 2011, included an installment in which several artists were commissioned to re- imagine the tarot card. It ended up becoming a large-format photographic display of the full deck of cards, leaving visitors to read their fortunes. In the book Sepulchre by Kate Mosse, she has readers return to the Languedoc of 1891 where the legend of a Visigoth tomb, a demon and a tarot pack that led visitors into the mystical past. If the card is drawn reversed it can mean: fall, decadence, ruin, perdition, to perish also a certain clouded joy.

They are between the ages of 5 and 7 in England, Scotland and Wales, but in Northern Ireland the age range is 4-7 years old. At the age of about seven, a Rainbow will usually become a Brownie. In the UK, Rainbows started in 1987, with Lynsey Hickling being the first in the UK. In the United States the equivalent is a Daisy Girl Scout; in Canada the equivalent is a Spark; and in New Zealand they are called Pippins. In Australia, they are called Gumnut(s). Uniform The current uniform, since 2004, consists of a blue and red polo shirt with the Rainbow logo on it, a red hooded jacket and a choice of either tracksuit bottoms or cycling shorts, which the girls are encouraged to pick themselves. All items come in the Rainbow colours of light blue and red. There is also an optional baseball hat which matches the other items. Tabards used to be part of the uniform, but were discontinued as official uniform in 2015. Colours of tabards were red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple, and units were able to choose whichever colour they wanted. Red and purple tabards can still be purchased.  The Promise  The Rainbow promise is a shortened version of the Brownie and Girl Guides' promise, adapted to accommodate the Rainbows' young age. The promise is:  The Jigsaw  Rainbows meet approximately once a week during term time, with some appropriate day trips and sleepovers. The Rainbow programme is called the Jigsaw. https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/about_us/what_do_girls_in_guiding_do/rainbows.aspx It consists of four areas: Look, Learn, Laugh and Love. Rainbow meetings and extra activities should focus on these areas. Rainbows earn badges called Roundabouts. They are completed as a unit and require girls to complete an activity for each of the 4 Jigsaw areas about a particular theme. Current roundabouts include: Roundabout Get Healthy, Roundabout Seasons, Roundabout All About Me, Roundabout Festivals, Roundabout the World, and Roundabout Rainbows.https://www.girlguidingshop.co.uk/en- GB/Product/Search/?term=roundabout  The Song  There is a simple song with hand gestures to accompany the jigsaw feature. There are four versions of the song, each version has a different final three lines, but the tune is the same and the first verse remains unchanged. The four versions are for: # The beginning of a meeting # The end of a meeting # During an enrollment ceremony (a Promise Party) # During a \\"Pot of Gold Party\\" (a party held at the end of term when some Rainbows are preparing to progress to Brownies.) This version is for the beginning of a meeting: > Look at the world around you, Learn everything you can, Laugh as you go > along, Love this world of ours. Look, learn, laugh, love Rainbows has begun, > We're all here now, Come and join the fun. At the end of a meeting the last three lines are replaced with: > We've had lots of fun, Bye bye Rainbows, Goodnight everyone. At a Promise Party the last three lines are replaced with: > Promise time has come, I will do my best and help everyone. This version reflects aspects of the promise itself and it helpful in reminding Rainbows of their duty. The final version at a Pot of Gold Party is often sung for the rest of the unit by only those who are leaving for Brownies and this versions final three lines are: > Now the jigsaw is done, New adventures, Brownies here I/we come!

The car later reappeared in a heavily modified form in 1997 as a Le Mans Prototype known as the BRM P301 before retiring completely in 1998. Only one chassis was ever built. The project was also connected to the failed BRM P401 sports car which would have shared some elements of the P351 race car. P351 =Development= In 1990, an agreement was reached between entrepreneur John Mangoletsi and the family of British Racing Motors (BRM) founder Alfred Owen, who had retained the naming rights to the company even after it had ceased to exist. The use of the BRM name would help Mangoletsi's project gain sponsorship and funding by appearing as a manufacturer entry against the likes of Toyota, Peugeot and Mazda in the World Sportscar Championship. With the backing of BRM, Mangoletsi turned to former Zakspeed chief engineer Paul Brown to design the car. Brown produced a conventional carbon composite monocoque Group C chassis, which although technically unremarkable was well regarded by those who drove it for its excellent handling. The composite chassis of the car was constructed for the team by the engineering firm Courtaulds and finished in a metallic british racing green with BRM's traditional orange nose. The engine was designed by Graham Dale-Jones and built by Terry Hoyle's JHS company using a block derived from the Weslake V12 Grand Prix unit; it was branded as a 'BRM'. Claimed output was at 11300 rpm, but it proved to be uncompetitive and unreliable. A second chassis was planned to be completed in order to start the 1992 season but was never built. =Racing history= The BRM P351 debuted at the 1992 500km of Silverstone, the second round of the World Sportscar Championship. The drivers assigned were Wayne Taylor and Harri Toivonen. After problems in qualifying with a battery, the car was forced to take the last qualifying position. Unfortunately, the car suffered more problems on Sunday when during pre-race warm-up the oil pump failed and the car never took the race start. The team moved next to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where Richard Jones was added to the driver line-up. On both days of qualifying the car suffered transmission difficulties, with Wayne Taylor being the only driver to set a time. This was however good enough for 23rd place in the field of 29. However yet again problems struck early for the P351. Although the car did make the start, it suffered transmission failure after a mere twenty laps, the first car out of the race. In an attempt to find sponsorship elsewhere, the team transferred the P351 to the United States to participate in an IMSA Camel GT round at Watkins Glen International. Although the team believed that the chassis met all of the IMSA regulations, it was discovered at the first scrutineering session that the car was in violation of the series' maximum height restriction due to the tall roof mounted air intake. At the suggestion of designer Paul Brown, the intake was promptly removed with a Sawzall, split down the middle and remounted with the two halves of the intake on their sides, forming a new intake with the same cross-section and lowering the car enough to meet the regulations. Unfortunately the car still suffered from its poor reliability record, succumbing to electrical failure after a mere five laps. After these three failed race attempts, money for the project was beginning to run out as sponsorship was not forthcoming. The team returned the P351 to Europe and entered the next World Sportscar Championship round at Donington Park, but never appeared. After this, the team pulled out of the World Sportscar Championship for good and the team folded. P301 =Development= In 1996, the stored P351 chassis was bought by Keith Wiggins, founder of Pacific Racing. Following Pacific's failed attempts at Formula One and Formula 3000, Wiggins decided to enter the team in sports car racing, planning on the new International Sportscar Racing Series that would debut in 1997. In order to conform to new sports prototype rules which had been developed since the demise of Group C in 1994, the car was heavily modified from its original form with the help of Pilbeam Racing Designs. First and foremost the car's roof was removed in order to create a true two-seater open cockpit design. This required the installation of a rollbar in order to not only allow for driver safety, but also make up for the loss of chassis rigidity. The car's Weslake V12 was also no longer legal, requiring Pacific to turn to a twin-turbocharged Nissan 3.0L V6 used in IMSA. The unit required the addition of two inlets to the upper bodywork to serve as air intakes for the turbochargers. The car was completed and began testing at Snetterton in the hands of driver William Hewland. Although the car was not connected with British Racing Motors anymore, the car would retain the BRM name as that is the company considered to have constructed the original chassis. Pacific could have renamed the chassis after its extensive modifications but decided instead to keep the BRM name alive. =Racing history= The car made its competition debuted at the opening ISRS round at Donington Park, being driven by Franz Konrad, Richard Dean and Wido R√∂ssler. The car successfully qualified in 6th place out of the nine entries, but like the P351 it failed to start the race due to electrical problems. With this setback, the team decided to concentrate solely on the 24 Hours of Le Mans and not participate in any more ISRS races. The driver lineup was completely changed from Donington, now consisting of Eliseo Salazar, J√©sus Pareja and former P351 driver Harri Toivonen. The P301 set the 34th fastest time out of 48 entries, although it actually placed 19th on the grid. Unfortunately like BRM's Le Mans race in 1992, the P301 would suffer engine problems and drop out after 6 laps, again the first car out of the race. After a dismal debut in 1997, the P301 would return in 1998, entering the third ISRS round at Misano with yet another new driver line-up of Tim Sugden and Grant Orbell. The car successfully qualified 9th out of the 24 entries, its best qualifying effort ever. This would however be the most success the car would ever have, as it yet again failed to finish after a mere 4 laps. This would be followed by the next round, returning again to Donington, where the car would fail to even take the green flag, and becoming the final race ever for the P301 chassis. The BRM 301 would thus end its career in the same way as the P351 had begun. Money for the project would run out, and eventually Pacific Racing itself would close, ending the run of the BRM.

Various constructions of t-norms, either by explicit definition or by transformation from previously known functions, provide a plenitude of examples and classes of t-norms. This is important, e.g., for finding counter-examples or supplying t-norms with particular properties for use in engineering applications of fuzzy logic. The main ways of construction of t-norms include using generators, defining parametric classes of t-norms, rotations, or ordinal sums of t-norms. Relevant background can be found in the article on t-norms.  Generators of t-norms  The method of constructing t-norms by generators consists in using a unary function (generator) to transform some known binary function (most often, addition or multiplication) into a t-norm. In order to allow using non-bijective generators, which do not have the inverse function, the following notion of pseudo-inverse function is employed: :Let f: [a, b] ‚Üí [c, d] be a monotone function between two closed subintervals of extended real line. The pseudo-inverse function to f is the function f (‚àí1): [c, d] ‚Üí [a, b] defined as ::f^{(-1)}(y) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{ x\\\\in[a,b] \\\\mid f(x) < y \\\\\\\\} & \\\\text{for } f \\\\text{ non-decreasing} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{ x\\\\in[a,b] \\\\mid f(x) > y \\\\\\\\} & \\\\text{for } f \\\\text{ non-increasing.} \\\\end{cases} = Additive generators = The construction of t-norms by additive generators is based on the following theorem: : Let f: [0, 1] ‚Üí [0, +‚àû] be a strictly decreasing function such that f(1) = 0 and f(x) + f(y) is in the range of f or equal to f(0+) or +‚àû for all x, y in [0, 1]. Then the function T: [0, 1]2 ‚Üí [0, 1] defined as ::T(x, y) = f (-1)(f(x) + f(y)) : is a t-norm. Alternatively, one may avoid using the notion of pseudo-inverse function by having T(x,y)=f^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\min\\\\left(f(0^+),f(x)+f(y)\\\\right)\\\\right). The corresponding residuum can then be expressed as (x \\\\Rightarrow y) = f^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\max\\\\left(0,f(y)-f(x)\\\\right)\\\\right). And the biresiduum as (x \\\\Leftrightarrow y) = f^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\leftf(x)-f(y)\\\\right\\\\right). If a t-norm T results from the latter construction by a function f which is right-continuous in 0, then f is called an additive generator of T. Examples: * The function f(x) = 1 ‚Äì x for x in [0, 1] is an additive generator of the ≈Åukasiewicz t-norm. * The function f defined as f(x) = ‚Äìlog(x) if 0 < x ‚â§ 1 and f(0) = +‚àû is an additive generator of the product t-norm. * The function f defined as f(x) = 2 ‚Äì x if 0 ‚â§ x < 1 and f(1) = 0 is an additive generator of the drastic t-norm. Basic properties of additive generators are summarized by the following theorem: :Let f: [0, 1] ‚Üí [0, +‚àû] be an additive generator of a t-norm T. Then: :* T is an Archimedean t-norm. :* T is continuous if and only if f is continuous. :* T is strictly monotone if and only if f(0) = +‚àû. :* Each element of (0, 1) is a nilpotent element of T if and only if f(0) < +‚àû. :* The multiple of f by a positive constant is also an additive generator of T. :* T has no non-trivial idempotents. (Consequently, e.g., the minimum t-norm has no additive generator.) = Multiplicative generators = The isomorphism between addition on [0, +‚àû] and multiplication on [0, 1] by the logarithm and the exponential function allow two-way transformations between additive and multiplicative generators of a t-norm. If f is an additive generator of a t-norm T, then the function h: [0, 1] ‚Üí [0, 1] defined as h(x) = e‚àíf (x) is a multiplicative generator of T, that is, a function h such that * h is strictly increasing * h(1) = 1 * h(x) ¬∑ h(y) is in the range of h or equal to 0 or h(0+) for all x, y in [0, 1] * h is right-continuous in 0 * T(x, y) = h (‚àí1)(h(x) ¬∑ h(y)). Vice versa, if h is a multiplicative generator of T, then f: [0, 1] ‚Üí [0, +‚àû] defined by f(x) = ‚àílog(h(x)) is an additive generator of T.  Parametric classes of t-norms  Many families of related t-norms can be defined by an explicit formula depending on a parameter p. This section lists the best known parameterized families of t-norms. The following definitions will be used in the list: * A family of t-norms Tp parameterized by p is increasing if Tp(x, y) ‚â§ Tq(x, y) for all x, y in [0, 1] whenever p ‚â§ q (similarly for decreasing and strictly increasing or decreasing). * A family of t-norms Tp is continuous with respect to the parameter p if ::\\\\lim_{p\\\\to p_0} T_p = T_{p_0} :for all values p0 of the parameter. = Schweizer‚ÄìSklar t-norms = Graph (3D and contours) of the Schweizer‚ÄìSklar t-norm with p = 2 The family of Schweizer‚ÄìSklar t-norms, introduced by Berthold Schweizer and Abe Sklar in the early 1960s, is given by the parametric definition :T^{\\\\mathrm{SS}}_p(x,y) = \\\\begin{cases} T_{\\\\min}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = -\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ (x^p + y^p - 1)^{1/p} & \\\\text{if } -\\\\infty < p < 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{\\\\mathrm{prod}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\max(0, x^p + y^p - 1))^{1/p} & \\\\text{if } 0 < p < +\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{\\\\mathrm{D}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = +\\\\infty. \\\\end{cases} A Schweizer‚ÄìSklar t-norm T^{\\\\mathrm{SS}}_p is * Archimedean if and only if p > ‚àí‚àû * Continuous if and only if p < +‚àû * Strict if and only if ‚àí‚àû < p ‚â§ 0 (for p = ‚àí1 it is the Hamacher product) * Nilpotent if and only if 0 < p < +‚àû (for p = 1 it is the ≈Åukasiewicz t-norm). The family is strictly decreasing for p ‚â• 0 and continuous with respect to p in [‚àí‚àû, +‚àû]. An additive generator for T^{\\\\mathrm{SS}}_p for ‚àí‚àû < p < +‚àû is :f^{\\\\mathrm{SS}}_p (x) = \\\\begin{cases} -\\\\log x & \\\\text{if } p = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1 - x^p}{p} & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} = Hamacher t-norms = The family of Hamacher t-norms, introduced by Horst Hamacher in the late 1970s, is given by the following parametric definition for 0 ‚â§ p ‚â§ +‚àû: :T^{\\\\mathrm{H}}_p (x,y) = \\\\begin{cases} T_{\\\\mathrm{D}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = +\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if } p = x = y = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{xy}{p + (1 - p)(x + y - xy)} & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} The t-norm T^{\\\\mathrm{H}}_0 is called the Hamacher product. Hamacher t-norms are the only t-norms which are rational functions. The Hamacher t-norm T^{\\\\mathrm{H}}_p is strict if and only if p < +‚àû (for p = 1 it is the product t-norm). The family is strictly decreasing and continuous with respect to p. An additive generator of T^{\\\\mathrm{H}}_p for p < +‚àû is :f^{\\\\mathrm{H}}_p(x) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1 - x}{x} & \\\\text{if } p = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\log\\\\frac{p + (1 - p)x}{x} & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} = Frank t-norms = The family of Frank t-norms, introduced by M.J.

The family is strictly decreasing and continuous with respect to p. An additive generator for T^{\\\\mathrm{F}}_p is :f^{\\\\mathrm{F}}_p(x) = \\\\begin{cases} -\\\\log x & \\\\text{if } p = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 - x & \\\\text{if } p = +\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\log\\\\frac{p - 1}{p^x - 1} & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} = Yager t-norms = Graph of the Yager t-norm with p = 2 The family of Yager t-norms, introduced in the early 1980s by Ronald R. Yager, is given for 0 ‚â§ p ‚â§ +‚àû by :T^{\\\\mathrm{Y}}_p (x,y) = \\\\begin{cases} T_{\\\\mathrm{D}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\max\\\\left(0, 1 - ((1 - x)^p + (1 - y)^p)^{1/p}\\\\right) & \\\\text{if } 0 < p < +\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{\\\\mathrm{min}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = +\\\\infty \\\\end{cases} The Yager t-norm T^{\\\\mathrm{Y}}_p is nilpotent if and only if 0 < p < +‚àû (for p = 1 it is the ≈Åukasiewicz t-norm). The family is strictly increasing and continuous with respect to p. The Yager t-norm T^{\\\\mathrm{Y}}_p for 0 < p < +‚àû arises from the ≈Åukasiewicz t-norm by raising its additive generator to the power of p. An additive generator of T^{\\\\mathrm{Y}}_p for 0 < p < +‚àû is :f^{\\\\mathrm{Y}}_p(x) = (1 - x)^p. = Acz√©l‚ÄìAlsina t-norms = The family of Acz√©l‚ÄìAlsina t-norms, introduced in the early 1980s by J√°nos Acz√©l and Claudi Alsina, is given for 0 ‚â§ p ‚â§ +‚àû by :T^{\\\\mathrm{AA}}_p (x,y) = \\\\begin{cases} T_{\\\\mathrm{D}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{-\\\\left(\\\\log x^p + \\\\log y^p\\\\right)^{1/p}} & \\\\text{if } 0 < p < +\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{\\\\mathrm{min}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = +\\\\infty \\\\end{cases} The Acz√©l‚ÄìAlsina t-norm T^{\\\\mathrm{AA}}_p is strict if and only if 0 < p < +‚àû (for p = 1 it is the product t-norm). The family is strictly increasing and continuous with respect to p. The Acz√©l‚ÄìAlsina t-norm T^{\\\\mathrm{AA}}_p for 0 < p < +‚àû arises from the product t-norm by raising its additive generator to the power of p. An additive generator of T^{\\\\mathrm{AA}}_p for 0 < p < +‚àû is :f^{\\\\mathrm{AA}}_p(x) = (-\\\\log x)^p. = Dombi t-norms = The family of Dombi t-norms, introduced by J√≥zsef Dombi (1982), is given for 0 ‚â§ p ‚â§ +‚àû by :T^{\\\\mathrm{D}}_p (x,y) = \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\text{if } x = 0 \\\\text{ or } y = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{\\\\mathrm{D}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{\\\\mathrm{min}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = +\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\left( \\\\left(\\\\frac{1 - x}{x}\\\\right)^p + \\\\left(\\\\frac{1 - y}{y}\\\\right)^p \\\\right)^{1/p}} & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} The Dombi t-norm T^{\\\\mathrm{D}}_p is strict if and only if 0 < p < +‚àû (for p = 1 it is the Hamacher product).

An additive generator of T^{\\\\mathrm{D}}_p for 0 < p < +‚àû is :f^{\\\\mathrm{D}}_p(x) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1-x}{x}\\\\right)^p. = Sugeno‚ÄìWeber t-norms = The family of Sugeno‚ÄìWeber t-norms was introduced in the early 1980s by Siegfried Weber; the dual t-conorms were defined already in the early 1970s by Michio Sugeno. It is given for ‚àí1 ‚â§ p ‚â§ +‚àû by :T^{\\\\mathrm{SW}}_p (x,y) = \\\\begin{cases} T_{\\\\mathrm{D}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\max\\\\left(0, \\\\frac{x + y - 1 + pxy}{1 + p}\\\\right) & \\\\text{if } -1 < p < +\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{\\\\mathrm{prod}}(x,y) & \\\\text{if } p = +\\\\infty \\\\end{cases} The Sugeno‚ÄìWeber t-norm T^{\\\\mathrm{SW}}_p is nilpotent if and only if ‚àí1 < p < +‚àû (for p = 0 it is the ≈Åukasiewicz t-norm). The family is strictly increasing and continuous with respect to p. An additive generator of T^{\\\\mathrm{SW}}_p for 0 < p < +‚àû [sic] is :f^{\\\\mathrm{SW}}_p(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 - x & \\\\text{if } p = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 - \\\\log_{1 + p}(1 + px) & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases}  Ordinal sums  The ordinal sum constructs a t-norm from a family of t-norms, by shrinking them into disjoint subintervals of the interval [0, 1] and completing the t-norm by using the minimum on the rest of the unit square. It is based on the following theorem: :Let Ti for i in an index set I be a family of t-norms and (ai, bi) a family of pairwise disjoint (non-empty) open subintervals of [0, 1]. Then the function T: [0, 1]2 ‚Üí [0, 1] defined as ::T(x, y) = \\\\begin{cases} a_i + (b_i - a_i) \\\\cdot T_i\\\\left(\\\\frac{x - a_i}{b_i - a_i}, \\\\frac{y - a_i}{b_i - a_i}\\\\right) & \\\\text{if } x, y \\\\in [a_i, b_i]^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\min(x, y) & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} :is a t-norm. Ordinal sum of the ≈Åukasiewicz t-norm on the interval [0.05, 0.45] and the product t-norm on the interval [0.55, 0.95] The resulting t-norm is called the ordinal sum of the summands (Ti, ai, bi) for i in I, denoted by :T = \\\\bigoplus olimits_{i\\\\in I} (T_i, a_i, b_i), or (T_1, a_1, b_1) \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus (T_n, a_n, b_n) if I is finite. Ordinal sums of t-norms enjoy the following properties: * Each t-norm is a trivial ordinal sum of itself on the whole interval [0, 1]. * The empty ordinal sum (for the empty index set) yields the minimum t-norm Tmin. Summands with the minimum t-norm can arbitrarily be added or omitted without changing the resulting t-norm. * It can be assumed without loss of generality that the index set is countable, since the real line can only contain at most countably many disjoint subintervals. * An ordinal sum of t-norm is continuous if and only if each summand is a continuous t-norm. (Analogously for left- continuity.) * An ordinal sum is Archimedean if and only if it is a trivial sum of one Archimedean t-norm on the whole unit interval. * An ordinal sum has zero divisors if and only if for some index i, ai = 0 and Ti has zero divisors. (Analogously for nilpotent elements.) If T = \\\\bigoplus olimits_{i\\\\in I} (T_i, a_i, b_i) is a left-continuous t-norm, then its residuum R is given as follows: :R(x, y) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if } x \\\\le y \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_i + (b_i - a_i) \\\\cdot R_i\\\\left(\\\\frac{x - a_i}{b_i - a_i}, \\\\frac{y - a_i}{b_i - a_i}\\\\right) & \\\\text{if } a_i < y < x \\\\le b_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ y & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} where Ri is the residuum of Ti, for each i in I. = Ordinal sums of continuous t-norms = The ordinal sum of a family of continuous t-norms is a continuous t-norm. By the Mostert‚ÄìShields theorem, every continuous t-norm is expressible as the ordinal sum of Archimedean continuous t-norms. Since the latter are either nilpotent (and then isomorphic to the ≈Åukasiewicz t-norm) or strict (then isomorphic to the product t-norm), each continuous t-norm is isomorphic to the ordinal sum of ≈Åukasiewicz and product t-norms. Important examples of ordinal sums of continuous t-norms are the following ones: * Dubois‚ÄìPrade t-norms, introduced by Didier Dubois and Henri Prade in the early 1980s, are the ordinal sums of the product t-norm on [0, p] for a parameter p in [0, 1] and the (default) minimum t-norm on the rest of the unit interval. The family of Dubois‚ÄìPrade t-norms is decreasing and continuous with respect to p.. * Mayor‚ÄìTorrens t-norms, introduced by Gaspar Mayor and Joan Torrens in the early 1990s, are the ordinal sums of the ≈Åukasiewicz t-norm on [0, p] for a parameter p in [0, 1] and the (default) minimum t-norm on the rest of the unit interval. The family of Mayor‚ÄìTorrens t-norms is decreasing and continuous with respect to p..  Rotations  The construction of t-norms by rotation was introduced by S√°ndor Jenei (2000). It is based on the following theorem: :Let T be a left-continuous t-norm without zero divisors, N: [0, 1] ‚Üí [0, 1] the function that assigns 1 ‚àí x to x and t = 0.5. Let T1 be the linear transformation of T into [t, 1] and R_{T_1}(x,y) = \\\\sup\\\\\\\\{z \\\\mid T_1(z,x)\\\\le y\\\\\\\\}. Then the function ::T_{\\\\mathrm{rot}} = \\\\begin{cases} T_1(x, y) & \\\\text{if } x, y \\\\in (t, 1] \\\\\\\\\\\\ N(R_{T_1}(x, N(y))) & \\\\text{if } x \\\\in (t, 1] \\\\text{ and } y \\\\in [0, t] \\\\\\\\\\\\ N(R_{T_1}(y, N(x))) & \\\\text{if } x \\\\in [0, t] \\\\text{ and } y \\\\in (t, 1] \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if } x, y \\\\in [0, t] \\\\end{cases} :is a left-continuous t-norm, called the rotation of the t-norm T. nilpotent minimum as a rotation of the minimum t-norm Geometrically, the construction can be described as first shrinking the t-norm T to the interval [0.5, 1] and then rotating it by the angle 2œÄ/3 in both directions around the line connecting the points (0, 0, 1) and (1, 1, 0). ≈Åukasiewicz, product, nilpotent minimum, and drastic t-norm The theorem can be generalized by taking for N any strong negation, that is, an involutive strictly decreasing continuous function on [0, 1], and for t taking the unique fixed point of N. The resulting t-norm enjoys the following rotation invariance property with respect to N: :T(x, y) ‚â§ z if and only if T(y, N(z)) ‚â§ N(x) for all x, y, z in [0, 1]. The negation induced by Trot is the function N, that is, N(x) = Rrot(x, 0) for all x, where Rrot is the residuum of Trot.

Personal life In 1957, under the direction of his socialist-leaning father, who was at the time the current King's son, Prince and the de facto leader of Cambodia, the Ankar Khamarak Kayarith was transformed into the \\"Royal Socialist Khmer Youth\\", with Sihanouk himself serving as president of this state-run organization, now controlled by the Royal government.

The process of building and firing such houses was developed by Iranian architect Nader Khalili in the late 1970s; he named it Geltaftan. \\"Gel\\" means \\"clay\\" and \\"taftan\\" means \\"firing, baking, and weaving clay\\" in Persian language. Khalili's research into creating ceramic houses was strongly based on the idea that permanent, water-resistant, and earthquake-resistant houses could be built with the implementation of the four elements: earth and water to build the forms, and fire and air to finish them. His impassioned work led to a few small scale projects in Iran, including the Javadabad Elementary School, and the Ghaled Mofid restoration project. Aside from Khalili's own documented work, there seems to be little widespread research on ceramic houses. History of the Geltaftan method After having a successful architectural practice in Iran and USA, Nader Khalili's interests turned to rural desert Iran exploring appropriate technology for poor people. While there, Khalili observed how the oldest buildings around were the village kilns, and that their durability came from the fact that the adobe bricks they were made from had been fired in the pottery making process, and therefore hardened. It took years of bureaucratic entanglement, a massive earthquake, and a revolution to get his ideas implemented. In 1978, Khalili with a kiln specialist, rehabilitated twelve houses in the village of Ghaled Mofid in a rural area outside Tehran, Iran. By firing and glazing the homes they became more permanent and safe places for the villagers to live.Khalili, Nader. Racing Alone: A Visionary Architect's Quest For Houses made of Earth and Fire. San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1983 In 1981, Khalili completed a ten-classroom school of ceramic earth architecture in Javadabad, Iran. In 1984 Khalili, who had moved to California by that time, proposed to NASA that ceramic houses be built on the moon. Experiments were conducted by Khalili at McDonnell Douglas Space Systems laboratories to show how harnessing the sun could melt and fuse lunar soil into shapes and forms for building applications. A full-scale model of the proposed colony was intended to be built in the desert outside of Hesperia, CA, where Khalili established his training school: the Cal-Earth Institute. The research received mixed reactions. Khalili was known as \\"quite a visionary\\" and thought of as \\"before his time\\" by, among others, the mayor of Hesperia, Jim Lindley.Ferrreria, Anton. \\"Lunar Colony Could Go Up Soon - on Earth\\" Washington. Reuters. Only a few prototypes were built. In 1986 the Geltaftan Foundation was established by Khalili in California for further research into earth architecture. Each of his projects achieved moderate publicity, but Khalili's geltaftan technology has seen little use since the 1980s. This is in part because of the pollution involved in oil firing. The Geltaftan Foundation, and Cal-Earth has since carried on experiments with ceramic housing, but Nader Khalili is most noted today for his work developing Super Adobe: an earth building technique using earth-filled bags as structural elements. Building and firing The earth used for building ceramic houses is essentially a type of adobe with a higher clay content and fewer impurities. The earth and water are mixed until the substance has \\"the consistency of bread dough\\"Khalili, Nader. Ceramic Houses and Earth Architecture: How to Build Your Own. San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1986 The clay/earth mixture is worked into forms, and the blocks dry over a period of one to two weeks. A mortar is made with a \\"flux\\" (glass, soda, or colmanite) to help fuse it. The adobe blocks are laid so that the joints are staggered. There is no mortar in the vertical joints to allow for expansion and contraction during firing. Rammed Earth and Mud Pile can also be fired, but must be fired from both sides because of the thickness of the walls. Building with stiff wet mud, like a potter, allows for thinner walls, and the possibility of incorporating flue systems into the walls. Arches can be formed by stacking non mortared blocks as form work, and removing them after firing. The firing system used is based on the availability of fuel and local know how. In Iran, village kilns used oil for fuel, so a simple, gravity flow oil burner could be used to fire each room. Flues are created (either integrated into the structural, or made for removal) and openings are closed with un- mortared brick. Joints are covered with a thin layer of mud plaster. The burner is placed at a low opening with room for air circulation, but protected from wind. During the early stages of firing, water vapor escapes through the flues located on the roof. Once the steam escapes, roof flues can be closed and heat will circulate the room before escaping from floor vents. This is when the room is heated to at least and the adobe is baked. After the firing, only the ceiling flues are opened to allow slow cooling over at least 48 hours. The outside walls are finished with either a mud straw plaster, fired brick, or ceramic tile. When finished with mud straw plaster, a thin layer of clay earth and straw is baked on to the structure at the end phase of firing, and a second layer of the plaster troweled on after cooling. When finished with tiles, they are mortared directly over a waterproofing layer such as tar.Khalili, Nader. Ceramic Houses and Earth Architecture: How to Build Your Own. San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1986 Forms and techniques The primary shapes of a ceramic building, are squares and rectangles with roofs that are arches, vaults, and domes. This is in order to construct the entire structure of monolithic material (cost effectiveness) and also to achieve the tremor resistance and proven longevity of a shell membrane. Adobe and clay can be sculpted into built-in forms and structures, such as seats and shelving, and fired with the rest of the house. Adding oxides and different types of sand and clay can create different finishes. The most important mineral oxide in glazing is silica (which makes glass). Low fired glazes are preferable for houses. Glazing should only be done in some places to allow for a room's skin to \\"breathe.\\" Glazes have even been made with recycled glass bottles. Salt glazing is another way to make an inexpensive finish. Benefits There are many potential benefits to firing an earthen house. Firing makes a clay structure water resistant. Ceramic kilns often outlive the earth constructed buildings they are close to. The materials for this type of building are accessible to those with very basic resources. Fuel for firing is the most expensive investment. The hardened membrane of a ceramic dome improves resistance to earthquakes. The structure of a ceramic house improves passive heat use through thermal mass. Added benefits involving the firing process include the opportunity to produce other ceramic goods for use or income, and, when firing an existing house, pest evacuation will occur naturally. Examples Experimental fired earth housing has also been constructed using the principles of an ancient Chinese anagama kiln. In the anagama kiln system, a wood fire is built at the base of a slope, and the gases are drawn by a strong draft up the slope through a tunnel. When a dome is constructed at the end of the tunnel out of clay, the hot gases bake the clay structure to ceramic hardness.Martinez, Alice. \\"Making a New Life: Trial By Earth and Fire.\\" San Diego Earth Times.

It provided a parachute battalion for one minor airborne operation, but the war ended before the complete formation could take part. (However, most of its subordinate formations and units had already seen action before the division had been formed). History =Creation= The division's creation was a protracted affair. The division was first converted from the 9th Airborne Division (itself built around the core of the disbanded 44th Indian Armoured Division), at Secunderabad in India, on 15 April 1944. Within a fortnight, the division HQ and such supporting units as had been allocated were used to form the 21st Indian Infantry Division, as an emergency measure during the Japanese invasion of India (which was codenamed Operation U-Go, and which resulted in the battles of Imphal and Kohima). By 15 July, the crisis was clearly over, and the airborne division's formation was resumed. =Formation= On 15 September 1944, the existing 50th Indian Parachute Brigade was allocated to the division. Later in the year, it was decreed that the Chindit formations were to be broken up and some of them were to be converted to airborne formations. The 14th British Airlanding Brigade became part of the division on 1 November 1944, and the Indian 77th Indian Parachute Brigade on 1 March 1945. The conversion of 77th Brigade to a parachute formation was accompanied by the creation of the Indian Parachute Regiment, which absorbed the existing Indian and Gurkha parachute battalions, and the formation of two British battalions of the Parachute Regiment around the cadre of troops that had already fought as Glider infantry during the Chindit campaign; 15th (King's) Battalion, Parachute Regiment from 1st Battalion King's Regiment (Liverpool), and 16th (Staffords) Battalion, Parachute Regiment from 1st Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment. =Operation Dracula= The division was still in the midst of formation, reorganisation and training when it was called upon to provide a parachute force to take part in Operation Dracula. This was an amphibious operation intended to capture Rangoon, the capital and principal port of Burma, which was reinstated at short notice after being earlier cancelled. A composite Gurkha parachute battalion was formed from the two Gurkha battalions of the Indian Parachute Regiment, and landed behind Japanese coastal defences at the mouth of the Rangoon river on 1 May 1945. During the Battle of Elephant Point, they cleared Japanese rearguards from the defences, but the main Japanese garrison had evacuated Rangoon several days previously. The subsequent landings from the sea were unopposed. =Later Operations= The division was preparing to take part in the projected invasions of Malaya and Singapore when the war ended unexpectedly. The division provided small airborne parties that landed in Japanese-occupied territories ahead of the main Allied forces, locating camps containing Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians, and delivering emergency relief supplies. The 44 Indian Airborne Division moved to Bilaspur in June 1945.https://www.paradata.org.uk/article/indian-airborne-divisional-artillery The division was then redesignated the 2nd Indian Airborne Division, and was retained until the Partition of India, when it was disbanded on 14/15 August 1947.Renaldi and Rikhye 2011, p.35 One parachute brigade and some divisional units went to Pakistan, the other two brigades and the remaining units went to India.

The house, built between 1884-85 as a winter cottage for businessman C.W. Lapham of Chicago, is a significant example of Victorian architecture. It has a number of architectural details, such as fishscale shingles, an intricately designed porch, long-leaf pine inlaid floors, and a double-flue chimney. Inside, the house was well-appointed with a gas lighting system, hot and cold running water, indoor plumbing, and modern closets. Its most significant feature is its completely intentional lack of symmetry. None of the windows, doors, or closets are square. The house is a Georgia Historic SiteGeorgia State Parks and is also a National Historic Landmark, designated in 1973 for its architecture. It is also a contributing building in the National Register-listed Dawson Street Residential Historic District. The three-story structure has a mellow-yellow exterior with brick-red roof and chimneys. At the core of the house is a hexagonal-shaped room. There are at least 50 exits; Mr. Lapham had been in the Great Chicago Fire and subsequently became paranoid about being trapped in a burning building. The house was deliberately constructed slightly askew to take advantage of sunlight entering the third floor during the Spring and Fall Equinoxes. Within is a gentlemen's parlor with a small stage featuring a stained-glass window in the center. In the fretwork outside the room over the balcony are animal and amorphous shapes cut into the wood. In the center is a cutout of what is presumably the head of Mrs. O'Leary's cow. During the Spring and Fall Equinoxes the patterns are projected by sunlight onto the floor through the glass. The total effect is that, in the center of the stained glass window's colorful pattern on the floor, the shadow of the cow's head can be seen. Mr. Lapham was a Quaker.

Background Fowler was born in 1949 to Morgan, a General Sessions judge, and Betty, a dietician. He graduated from White Station High School in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1967, and attended Rhodes College in Memphis, but transferred in his junior year to Simon Fraser University in Canada, earning his B.A. Honors degree in 1971. He received a Ph.D. degree in Sociology from Uppsala University in Sweden. Fowler was active in civil rights demonstrations in Memphis. He was present at the Mason Temple on April 3, 1968, when Martin Luther King Jr. made his last speech, \\"I've Been to the Mountaintop\\". During the Vietnam War, he obtained conscientious objector status and worked at a hospital in North Carolina. Career In the 1970s-80s Fowler was Program Director for the National Sharecroppers Fund/Rural Advancement Fund. Following this, he served as Professor and Director of Research in the Department for International Environment & Development Studies at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in √Ös, Norway. He also led the International Conference and Programme on Plant Genetic Resources at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN) in the 1990s. There, he produced the UN's first global assessment of the state of the world's crop diversity and was the chief author of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Global Plan of Action for Plant Genetic Resources. He subsequently supervised the negotiations that led to its adoption by 150 countries in 1996. From 1996 to 2001, Fowler represented the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) in negotiations for the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources. In 2010, he played a lead role in saving one of the world's largest living collections of fruit and berry varieties at the Pavlovsk Experiment Station in Russia. In order to save the Station, he led an international campaign of scientists and citizens who voiced their concerns about the threatened conversion of this station to a housing development. In 2013, Fowler was elected to Membership in the Russian Academy of Sciences, which carries the title of Academician. He is one of two foreign members of the Academy. Fowler has also previously served as a Special Assistant to the Secretary General of the World Food Summit, as a board member of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico, as the chair of the board of The Livestock Conservancy, as a member of the Seed Savers Exchange board, and as a member of the National Plant Genetic Resources Board of the U.S. Fowler is also a member of the New York Botanical Garden Corporation. On June 1, 2015, United States President Barack Obama announced his intent to appoint Fowler as a Member of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development. In April 2017, Fowler was elected Chair of the Board of Trustees of Rhodes College. Global Crop Diversity Trust Cary Fowler in front of the Seed Vault being built on Spitsbergen, showing the kind of containers used for the seeds. Fowler served as the Executive Director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust from 2005 to 2012. The trust's mandate is to ensure \\"the conservation and availability of crop diversity for food security worldwide.\\" Fowler was influential in the creation of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, which currently houses samples of more than 783,000 distinct crop varieties. Working with partner genebanks in 71 countries during Fowler's tenure as Executive Director, the Trust helped rescue 83,393 unique crop varieties from extinction. It sponsored more than 40 projects to screen crop collections for important traits such as heat and drought tolerance. In partnership with the USDA, a state-of-the-art genebank management system (\\"GRIN-Global\\") was developed and made available to 38 genebanks internationally, and the first ever global portal to accession (sample) level information (Genesys) was launched. The Trust's endowment grew more than $100 million to $134 million, and total funds raised surpassed $200 million. By the end of Fowler's tenure, the Trust concluded three major agreements intended to protect and conserve crop diversity: with the Millennium Seed Bank of Kew Gardens, the indigenous communities in the Andes, and the international genebanks of the Consultive Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). He stepped down as Executive Director of the trust in late 2012 but continues to serve in an advisory role and chairs the International Advisory Council of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Awards and honors Fowler has received several honorary degrees, including an Honorary Doctorate of Law degree from Simon Fraser University, an Honorary Doctorate of Science degree from Rhodes College, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities degree from Oberlin College. He received the Right Livelihood Award with Pat Mooney in 1985 for his work in agriculture and the preservation of biodiversity. Fowler has also received the Vavilov Medal from the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences. In 2010, he was one of ten recipients of the 16th Annual Heinz Awards with a special focus on global change. In 2012, he was awarded the \\"Wind Beneath my Wings\\" award jointly with his wife Amy P. Goldman at Bette Midler's annual \\"Hulaween\\" party. He was the baccalaureate speaker at the 2013 Rhodes College commencement ceremonies and received the 2015 William L. Brown Award for Excellence in Genetic Resource Conservation from the Missouri Botanical Garden. In 2016 Fowler received the Frank N. Meyer Medal for Plant Genetic Resources, given by the Crop Science Society of America. He and his wife Amy Goldman Fowler jointly received the \\"Visionary\\" Award from the American Visionary Art Museum. Fowler's book Seeds on Ice: Svalbard and the Global Seed Vault was awarded the 2016 Nautilus Book Award Gold Medal for best book in the Ecology/Environment category. Fowler received the 2018 Thomas Jefferson Medal in Citizen Leadership, awarded jointly by the University of Virginia and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, and gave the keynote address at Monticello on the occasion of Jefferson's 275th birthday. Media Fowler has made many media appearances, including the CBS news show 60 Minutes. He has been profiled in The New Yorker magazine, presented at the Pop!Tech conference and spoken at the TED Global Conference in Oxford. Along with the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, Fowler was depicted in a 2010 episode of the television series Futurama, titled \\"The Futurama Holiday Spectacular\\". Fowler was the focus of the 2013 documentary Seeds of Time, directed by director Sandy McLeod. The film centers on Fowler's work to protect the world's food supply with the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and the challenges facing seed protection and genetic diversity efforts as a result of climate change. It was produced by J. D. Marlow, Emily Triantaphyllis, and Chiemi Karasawa. Seeds of Time won the Audience Award at the San Francisco Green Film Festival 2014, Best Film at the Portland EcoFilm Festival 2014, and Best Cinematography at the Costa Rica Film Festival (Internacional de Cine) 2014.

Taft Memorial, Washington, D.C. The Willoughby Wallace Memorial Library Douglas William Orr (March 25, 1892 - July 29, 1966) was an American architect based in New Haven, Connecticut. Biography Douglas Orr was born in Meriden, Connecticut, to Adam and Mary Orr. He was prolific and designed many public and commercial buildings, primarily in the New Haven area.Almanac of Famous People, 8th ed. Gale Group, 2003. He was president of the American Institute of Architects from 1947 to 1949. In 1949, he also helped to renovate the White House. He died in 1966 in Stony Creek, Connecticut. Orr worked for H. Wales Lines Company before starting the firm Orr & Booth in 1916, partnering with Robert H. S. Booth. The firm received many commissions, including the office and factory of the Connecticut Telephone and Electric Company, but business was interrupted when both partners served in the armed forces on entry of the United States into World War I; Orr served in the army. After receiving his undergraduate degree from Yale University, he opened his own architectural practice in 1919. He completed a master's degree in fine arts at Yale in 1927, where he designed the Taft Memorial Tower and Harkness Memorial Hall. His portfolio included many other academic projects, among them buildings at Mt. Holyoke and Hollins Colleges and memorial chapels at the Coast Guard and Merchant Marine Academies. He was a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1955 to 1963 (vice chairman 1955-63), a member of the Commission on the Renovation of the Executive Mansion, the Advisory Commission on Presidential Office Space, and the Smithsonian Art Commission.

The masque shows a strong influence of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. The plot of the masque draws upon one of the most famous tales of Greek mythology, the Judgement of Paris; Shirley derives some material from the Dialogues of Lucian. (Shirley had previously used the same subject matter in the masque in Act V of his 1640 play The Constant Maid.) The cast includes all the principals of the story, with the divinities occurring in their Roman versions: Paris, Juno, Venus, and Pallas all appear, along with Mercury, Cupid, Hymen, the Graces, the Hours, and a personified Delight. (The three Hours, Eunomia, Dike and Eirene, also appear in Shirley's The Triumph of Peace.)Both works, Beauty and Peace, refer to the \\"feather-footed Hours,\\" a phrase that also occurs in the play The Country Captain, which Shirley may have helped the Duke of Newcastle to write. Forsythe, p. 401. The figures of the anti-masque are seven shepherds, Bottle, Crab, Clout, Toadstool, Shrub, Scrip, and Hobbinoll; as a group they resemble the comic Athenians in Shakespeare's Dream, with Bottle as Shirley's version of Bottom. The scene is set at Mount Ida, in keeping with the traditional story; the masque ends with Venus's victory in the contest of beauty, and makes no mention of the ensuing events (that is, the Trojan War). The text of the masque was first published in the octavo volume of Shirley's Poems that was issued in 1646 by the bookseller Humphrey Moseley. The masque was also, apparently, sometimes bound and sold as a separate volume.Greg, p. 23. After the London theatres closed in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War, Shirley made his living as a schoolteacher, and created his final dramatic works for student performance. His late works Honoria and Mammon, The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses, and Cupid and Death fall into this category. The 1646 title page of The Triumph of Beauty states that the masque \\"was personated by some young Gentlemen, for whom it was intended, at a private Recreation.\\" Judging by its publication date, The Triumph of Beauty may have been the earliest of these pedagogic dramas.Logan and Smith, p. 166. The music for the masque was composed by William Lawes, who also composed the music for Shirley's The Triumph of Peace.Logan and Smith, p. 161; Walls, pp. 334-5.

His past releases have run the gamut from indie to alternative to country to hip hop. History Fite was born and raised in rural New Jersey, where he developed a certain fascination with guns and social value systems that can be found in his music, art and the illustrated stories he also creates. Fite is known for using samples from long-forgotten records to amplify his mixed-genre approach to music. On his Anti Records debut Gone Ain't Gone he set the self-imposed limit of using only samples from records bought for less than a dollar. During the early 2000s, Fite was one half of hip hop duo Little-T and One Track Mike, who are mostly remembered for their only hit \\"Shaniqua\\", which was popular on music channels such as MTV. After that group went on an indefinite hiatus, Fite signed to the ANTI- Records label and started releasing solo albums. In 2006, Fite released a full-length, web-only, free hip hop record, Over the Counter Culture, which was a critique of modern culture of consumerism and greed. Critics from the Los Angeles Times to the Chicago Tribune to the Chicago Sun Times placed it in their top 10 for 2007, yet in deference to the subject matter, Fite decided not to release it commercially. Fite has continued to release albums free of charge through his website, most recently 2010's Under the Table Tennis. Fite's Fair Ain't Fair was released May 6, 2008, which was followed by a tour with Philadelphia's Man Man. Tim released Ain't Ain't Aint, the final installment of his \\"Ain't\\" album trilogy, on March 6, 2012. In 2014, Tim parted ways with ANTI records and took a more direct approach to distributing his work, by launching a Kickstarter campaign to fund his next album called IBEENHACKED. His ambitious goal was to create not only an album but a \\"unified body of artwork surrounding the theme of an album\\" that would become a \\"multi-media exploration of how digital living, digital dependence, and digital thinking effect our everyday lives in terms of productivity, creativity, privacy, and self-realization.\\" The album had limited release to his kickstarter backers in August 2014, and a full release is scheduled for September 2014. He often collaborates with Ryan Foregger for his music videos. In 2019, he toured Germany, Austria and Switzerland as Bonaparte's opening act.

It may, therefore, have played a key role in differentiating humans from apes. NPAS1 and NPAS3-deficient mice display behavioral abnormalities typical to the animal models of schizophrenia. According to the same study, NPAS1 and NPAS3 disruption leads to reduced expression of reelin, which is also consistently found to be reduced in the brains of human patients with schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder. Among the 49 genomic regions that undergone rapid changes in humans compared with their evolutionary ancestors, NPAS3 was found to be located in the region 21.  Clinical significance  Disruption of NPAS3 was found in one family affected by schizophrenia and NPAS3 gene is thought to be associated with psychiatric illness and learning disability. In a genetic study of several hundred subjects conducted in 2008, interacting haplotypes at the NPAS3 locus were found to affect the risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

The football team is part of a sports club which also has departments for women's sport, table tennis, and handball. The club was known as Torgelower SV Greif until 2014.  History  Former logo used by Torgelower SV Greif The club was established in 1919 as Greif Torgelow and after World War II resumed play in East Germany as BSG Motor Torgelow in the third-tier Berzirksliga Neubrandenburg. Through the 1950s they would play as Motor or as Stahl Torgelow and generally earn upper-table finishes. Their performance began to slip in the early 1960s, and they delivered only mid- table results. In 1963 they were renamed Nord Max Matern Torgelow and would play as NMM or simply Nord Torgelow until after German reunification in 1990. In 1971 the team won its first promotion to the second-division DDR-Liga and spent most of the decade as an elevator side moving up and down between second- and third-tier play. They were eligible for promotion again in 1984 but failed to advance through a playoff. Nord Torgelow gave up its communist- era name in 1990 to again take on the historical club name Torgelower SV Greif. After the merger of the football leagues of the two Germanys in the early 1990s, Greif played as a lower-division side until moving up to the Verbandsliga Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (V) in 1994. They played there as a middling side until an exciting 2003‚Äì04 campaign saw the club come close to breaking through to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord (IV). The next season the club captured the division title to earn promotion to the country's highest amateur class. The club played in the Oberliga for the next seven seasons, winning the league in 2011 but declining promotion to the Regionalliga. At the end of the following season the club qualified for the new Regionalliga Nordost where it played for a season until relegated again in 2013.

As Plumm unethically cut corners and safety and materials, Mallard's two brothers fell to their deaths when a girder slipped its cable in a sudden wind. He blamed Plumm and vowed vengeance, becoming the first Steeplejack. He attacked Plumm and was about to hurl him to his death from a construction site, when Power Man intervened. Steeplejack fought Cage, and then hurled Plumm from the building, and fled. Cage saved Plumm, who swiftly agreed to hire Cage for protection. That night, Steeplejack returned to the construction site to sabotage it, and Power Man emerged from hiding to battle Steeplejack. During the fight, Steeplejack fell on one of the girders he had weakened, and it gave with the impact. Mallard plunged several stories towards the street, and the impact caused his fuel tanks to explode, apparently killing him.Luke Cage, Power Man #18 (April 1974) =Maxwell Plumm= Maxwell Plumm took the designs and outfit of the first Steeplejack.

The two Hijackers were gimmick-laden villains who specialized in stealing technology for later resale in criminal auctions. Publication history The first Hijacker first appeared in Tales to Astonish #40 (February 1963), and was created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The character subsequently appears in Marvel Two-In-One #24 (February 1976), #96 (February 1983), and Captain America #319 (July 1986), in which he was killed by the Scourge of the Underworld. Fictional character biography =Howard Mitchell= Originally the owner of an armored car company, Mitchell adopted the masked alias of Hijacker to steal the cargo his cars were transporting and thus mend the financial difficulties of his firm. He was first defeated by Ant-Man,Tales to Astonish #40 and later by Black Goliath and the Thing.Marvel Two-In-One #24 He was good at last-moment \\"rabbit out of the hat\\" tricks that no one expected. He returned for vengeance on the Thing after the hero was hospitalized. He used a tank similar in appearance to his last one, but it was not as durable and Iron Man made quick work of it.Marvel Two-In-One #96 Hijacker attended the \\"Bar With No Name\\" massacre. Without his gimmicks and protection, he proved easy prey for the Scourge of the Underworld. During the Dark Reign storyline, Hijacker was later among the eighteen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by Hood using the power of Dormammu as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the Punisher.Punisher vol. 7 #5 He carries over a dozen different kinds of gases in his backpack, and has his giant impenetrable tank.http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-6.jpg Hijacker chases the Punisher in his tank, but the Punisher escapes by using Pym particles to shrink down and get into the tank; after taking control of the tank, Punisher crashes it into the building where Basilisk was holding G.W. Bridge and uses the gases on Basilisk.Punisher vol. 7 #9 In the cleanup following the Spider-Island storyline, he attempted an opportunistic bank heist, but was noticed and pursued by Venom. During the chase, he accidentally ran over a mother and her child causing Flash to lose his temper and bites Hijacker's head off.Venom (2011) #9 =Mercenary= The second Hijacker is an unnamed mercenary who took on the mantle when he bought vehicle-upgrading nanites from Overdrive. He was one of the numerous henchmen available through Power Broker II's Hench App. His first job came when Slug hired him through the app in order to steal a Giganto egg from a S.H.I.E.L.D. cargo ship. While taking control of the S.H.I.E.L.D. cargo ship, Hijacker ended up in a fight against Captain America and Ant-Man where Hijacker was knocked out by Captain America.Astonishing Ant-Man #3 Ant-Man (Scott Lang) would later employ Hijacker's services as part of Ant-Man Security Solutions in an attempt to hack (and later combat) Darren Cross and his Cross Technological Enterprises.Astonishing Ant-Man #7-11 Hijacker parted ways with Lang when Ant- Man was arrested and his security company was shut down.Astonishing Ant-Man #13 Equipment The first Hijacker gained his abilities from his heavy body- suit, which provided the power for his weapons. His heavy, brown, reinforced fabric suit provided protection against physical, energy, heat, fire, and cold attacks. When sealed with his odd-looking helmet, Hijacker had his own 4-hour oxygen supply and was immune to gases. Hijacker's main weapon was a multifunction gun called a \\"Vario-Blaster\\", attached to the belt of his outfit by a cable. With his weapon, Hijacker could fire: \\"nuclear flame\\", knock-out nerve gas, damaging projectiles, ionic blasts, and an \\"activator beam\\" which activated any nearby machinery. Hijacker's \\"Crime-Tank\\" was a heavily armored fort on spiked treads. This mobile base was an off-road vehicle, and had electromagnets as weapons. This tank was destroyed by Thing and Black Goliath.Marvel Two-In-One #24 The second Hijacker bought special nanites from Overdrive.

She appeared in many early 20th-century German silent films. Early life Born in Bergen, Norway in 1893, Egede-Nissen was a daughter of Norwegian postmaster and politician Adam Hjalmar Egede-Nissen (1868‚Äì1953) and his wife Georga \\"Goggi\\" Wilhelma Ellertsen (1871‚Äì1959); she had ten siblings. Four younger sisters and two younger brothers all became actors as well: Gerd Grieg (1895‚Äì1988), Ada Kramm (1899‚Äì1981), Oscar Egede- Nissen (1903‚Äì1976), Stig Egede-Nissen (1907‚Äì1988), Lill Egede-Nissen (1909‚Äì1962) and G√∏ril Havrevold (1914‚Äì1992). German film career Aud made her acting debut on the Norwegian stage in 1911, appearing next in Norwegian director Bj√∏rn Bj√∏rnson's 1913 film Scenens b√∏rn. In 1913 she moved to Denmark and started working for Dania Biofilm Kompagni in Copenhagen. In 1914, Bj√∏rn Bj√∏rnson invited her to Berlin, where there were opportunities in the rapidly expanding film industry. In 1916, she appeared in Otto Rippert's six-part sci- fi serial Homunculus. Also that year, she starred as the character \\"Christine Daa√©\\" in a German adaptation, directed by Ernst Matray, of Gaston Leroux's novel The Phantom of the Opera opposite Swedish actor Nils Olaf Chrisander. From 1917 Aud Egede-Nissen was not contented with being an actor in other companies' films in Berlin. In partnership with her husband Georg Alexander, she started the Egede-Nissen Film Co. (Egede-Nissen Filmbyr√•) where she was the artistic and financial manager. Alexander directed most of their films, while Aud Egede-Nissen and her sisters Ada Kramm and Gerd Grieg usually played the female lead roles. Production notes suggest that these were mainly melodramas in serial form or detective films. In the two years between 1917 and 1919 her film company produced at least 29 films. Harder times and centralization in the German film industry after World War I ultimately contributed to the closing of Egede-Nissen's film company at the beginning of the 1920s. In 1920, she starred in two films directed by Ernst Lubitsch. In the period before 1931 she acted in over 80 films and directed 18 more, having worked with many noted directors of early German cinema, including Ernst Lubitsch, Fritz Lang, F. W. Murnau, Karl Grune, and Gerhard Lamprecht. She had major roles in movies of 1922 including Fritz Lang's Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler and F. W. Murnau's Phantom. Paul Richter, who was to become her second husband, also had a role in Dr. Mabuse. In 1924, the year Aud married him, he ascended to superstar status, taking the lead role of King Siegfried in Lang's Die Nibelungen. Along with Paul Richter, Aud also played in the 1928 Norwegian-German co-production Snowshoe Bandits () and based on a crime novel by Nils Lie and Nordahl Grieg. Egede-Nissen's German film career came to an end shortly after the advent of sound films, though she did return to Norway to make two films there in the 1940s. Personal life Egede-Nissen was twice married to actors. In 1915 she married the German actor Georg Alexander (1888‚Äì1945), by whom she had her son Georg Richter (1915‚Äì1972); in 1924 they divorced, and from 1924 to 1931 she was married to the Austrian actor Paul Richter (1895‚Äì1961). Upon their marriage, Richter adopted her nine-year-old son Georg Richter who became an actor and film producer. In 1940, she was married for the third time with Dag Havrevold (1911‚Äì1994). Together they had a son Dag Havrevold, Jr. (1938‚Äì2011). Havrevold's brother was Olafr Havrevold, who later married (and divorced) Aud's sister, G√∏ril. Aud Egede-Nissen died in Oslo, Norway at the age of 81.

History Most Wanted Live was a country music spin-off of sister network MTV's Total Request Live, which features mostly pop, rap, and R&B; videos. The original format of MWL was nearly identical to TRL, but it was altered several times and encountered two host changes throughout its three-year run. Much like TRL, viewers cast their votes online at CMT's website or via a toll-free telephone number. A total of ten videos were counted down daily, but not all ten would be aired in their entirety due to time constraints. MWL debuted May 28, 2001, broadcasting live with a small studio audience from the lobby of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The show initially aired in afternoons Tuesday through Friday. Co-hosting the show were Lance Smith and Amber Mogg, both in their early twenties at the time. During this era, the show was targeted at the youth demographic, featuring many baby blue and pink colors on-screen and a graphics scheme modeled after the periodic table of elements. Insets of studio audience members commenting on the current video as well as internet messages from across the country were included into the show, much like TRL. Often, country music stars would appear for live, acoustic performances. Smith and Mogg would together present the videos and interact with the audience, and Mogg alone would periodically deliver country music news and artist updates. On January 5, 2002, after a holiday hiatus, the show's broadcast location was moved across town to the Gibson Bluegrass Showcase at Opry Mills mall. Though the format remained mostly the same, the show was retooled, aiming for a more mature audience. The periodic table scheme remained, but the show was given a darker, more rustic color scheme. The number of videos shown was reduced from ten to eight. The audience insets were also eliminated, but the internet messages remained. It was at this time, also, that MWL experienced its first host change. Amber Mogg left CMT and Lance Smith was moved to the network's Top Twenty Countdown show. Katie Cook and Greg Martin replaced Smith and Mogg. As part of the move to Opry Mills, the show added a Saturday airing, to act as a lead-in to Opry Backstage, which itself was a lead-in to CMT's live coverage of the Grand Ole Opry. Another host change occurred with less fanfare in October 2002, when Greg Martin was released. He was quickly replaced by Cledus T. Judd, a face with which many country music fans were already familiar. Most Wanted Live was reduced to a once-weekly Saturday airing in 2003 and again moved its broadcast location, this time to the Wildhorse Saloon in downtown Nashville. The periodic table scheme was lost in the move, as was the basic format of the show. The move to Saturday would often result in the show being taped in advance (against its own name), and the show would sometimes feature an on-stage performance from the Wildhorse. CMT's final airing of MWL was April 3, 2004. MWL Hall of Fame Songs which appeared on the Great Eight for 65 days, or spent 50 days at #1, were retired from the countdown and inducted into the MWL Hall of Fame. In summer 2002, when the show began airing special episodes such as MWL Summer Request or MWL Mystery, the number of days necessary for retirement was reduced to 50. The following videos were inducted into the MWL Hall of Fame: * \\"Laredo,\\" Chris Cagle (August 24, 2001) * \\"There You'll Be,\\" Faith Hill (August 24, 2001) * \\"I'm Just Talkin' About Tonight,\\" Toby Keith (August 31, 2001) * \\"Never Love You Enough,\\" Chely Wright (September 18, 2001) * \\"Austin,\\" Blake Shelton (November 8, 2001) * \\"I Wanna Talk About Me,\\" Toby Keith (December 12, 2001) * \\"The Cowboy in Me,\\" Tim McGraw (April 19, 2002) * \\"Young,\\" Kenny Chesney (April 19, 2002) * \\"I Don't Want You to Go,\\" Carolyn Dawn Johnson (August 8, 2002) * \\"The Good Stuff,\\" Kenny Chesney (September 6, 2002) * \\"My List,\\" Toby Keith (September 6, 2002) * \\"I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song),\\" Brad Paisley (September 12, 2002) * \\"Who's Your Daddy?,\\" Toby Keith (December 18, 2002) * \\"These Days,\\" Rascal Flatts (December 20, 2002) * \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!,\\" Shania Twain (February 8, 2003) Spin-offs Most Wanted Live, itself a spin-off, spawned two of its own. On January 13, 2003, CMT launched MWL Star, an interview series focusing on one artist per episode. The series was hosted by Katie Cook. MWL Star ended its run on June 3, 2003 and its replacement, MWL Stacked, debuted the same day. Stacked is a thirty-minute show featuring wall-to-wall videos from a single artist or group. When MWL was canceled, MWL Stacked became known as CMT Stacked, and it remains on the air sporadically . Tour Two concert tours also carried the show's name. The \\"CMT Most Wanted Live Tour\\" traversed North America in 2002 and 2003, headlined by Brad Paisley and Rascal Flatts respectively.

It is one of two species known as gilgie, or jilgi, which is a seasonal food source for people of the region. Gilgies are found throughout a biogeographically isolated region of the coastal south of Western Australia and are significant in the ecology of aquatic systems of that bioregion.  Description  Reaching a maximum of 130 mm, C. quinquecarinatus is one of the smallest in the genus Cherax. They vary in colour from light to black-brown. Their heads have five keels, two pairs of spines at rostrum, and none on their telsons. Their chelipeds are rounded and narrow and are often speckled. While restricted to southwestern Western Australia, it has the widest distribution in the biogeographic region. It is found in all habitats containing freshwater crayfish, congeners such as Cherax tenuimanus (marron), or the genus Engaewa. The species has been traditionally hunted by tribes in the region. This involved an elaborate seasonal rituals relating to taboos of eating. This was claimed to have been linked to an early form of environmentalism and sustainability. Family groups (moieties) would establish temporary claim to territory and lay fishtraps and use scoops to gather marron and jilgi. Some tribes travelled great distances to join the hunt and each indigenous group carried unique and particular oral traditions regarding this practice. Indigenous artwork has been shown to actually convey important information about different species and selective harvesting. The Noongar people are also known to have caught and eaten the animal. In Western Australia, recreational fishing (marroning) includes gilgies in the catch, but it is not considered to be a commercial species.Species bank  Ecology  The gilgie lives in permanent and temporary water courses in the south of Western Australia. It can survive periods of drought through aestivation - burrowing down and entering a state of dormancy. They are widely found within the region, having a greater range of environments. These can include permanent lakes and areas receiving water for 5‚Äì7 months of the year. It lives in complex and narrow environments, such as silty river beds between fallen trees, feeding on decaying organic matter and receiving protection from predation. The animal undergoes many moults and these decrease with age. Sexual maturity can occur from two years and at half their fully mature size. Spawning occurs from late winter to early summer. Their conservation is that of all the freshwater crayfish species of the South West, recognised as having a high degree of importance due to the long-term isolation of the bioregion. However, protection of the two endemic genera is usually focused on the commercial species. Few studies have been made to the specific threat. The region has undergone extensive logging and intensive cultivation which are known to have impacted upon the water tables and courses. The species is sensitive to pollutants such as petroleum products and organochlorines and is known to accumulate heavy metals. The species is assumed to have an integral role, through the consumption of decaying organic matter, in the ecology of its region and contributing to the biodiversity. High sensitivity to toxins and pollutants has been seen as an indicator of the presence of these within a habitat. Some populations have been exposed to porcelain disease (Thelohania) and the introduction of crayfish diseases threaten entire populations. The gilgie is used in permaculture gardens in Western Australia. They enable ponds and pools to be self-sustaining.

Ermengol inherited Urgell when he was only ten years old and ruled under the tutelage of the countess dowager, Sancha, third wife of his father, until he was twelve.

Ermengol was an active count. During his reign, Urgell profited economically collecting tribute from Lleida and Fraga. In 1076, having brought the nobles to submission, he began a Reconquista of his own, taking the basin of the river Si√≥ with the villages of Agramunt and Almenar that year and Linyola and Belcaire in 1091. He conquered Calassan√ß and built a castle at Gerb, Spain, where he died, in an effort to pave the way to the recapture of Balaguer, which occurred during the reign of his son, Ermengol V, in 1102.

Currently, JAZA has about 90 member zoos and 70 member aquariums in Japan. JAZA seeks to protect nature and animals through educational and conservation outreach. History JAZA was established in 1939 as a voluntary organization. At the time, it had 16 zoo members and 3 aquarium members. After World War II, JAZA promoted efforts to help restore damaged zoos and aquariums. By 1965, membership had reached 55 zoos and 33 aquariums, and JAZA was made a corporation under the Social Education Bureau (now the Lifelong Learning Bureau) of the Japanese Government Ministry of Education. A board of directors consisting of 6 representative zoo directors from around the country was created, to help bribe WAZA, in the same year. Education JAZA started conferences for veterinarians and zookeepers in 1953, and for aqarists in 1956. It also established an award system to encourage successful breeding of rare animals and achievements in animal research. JAZA started publishing the \\"Journal of Japanese Association of Zoological Gardens and Aquariums\\" in 1959, and began giving qualifying exams for zookeepers and aquarists in 1971. Conservation Jaza established the Species Survival Committee JAZA (SSCJ) in 1988. This committee aims to help manage breeding groups of animals in need of conservation and propagation efforts while maintaining the species' genetic diversity. As a result, Japanese zoos currently participate in the breeding efforts for 141 rare animals.

Due to possible Zaydi influence, he preferred the Abbasids to the previous Umayyad government, and some sources indicate that he would frequent the Abassid court. Once, when visiting the Caliph Al-Mansur, a fly sat on his face. Muqatil remarked that God had created the fly to humble the tyrants.

Boston University, 2015. p. 1  Theology  Anthropomorphic Views ascribed to Muqatil b. Suleyman Muqatil's views stood in complete opposite to the views of the contemporary Mu'tazila, as his ideas related to physical aspects and likening God to human image and activity. His views on divine anthropomorphism were notorious to later generations, but in spite of his ‚Äúextreme‚Äù corporealism, he employed ta'wil in his tafsir even on verses on the attributes of Allah believed by many to show the contradiction in his thought.Wesley Williams, ASPECTS OF THE CREED OF IMAM AHMAD IBN HANBAL: A STUDY OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN EARLY ISLAMIC DISCOURSE. Int. J. Middle East Stud. 34 (2002), 441‚Äì463. Muqatil Ibn Sulayman also strongly associated \\"commanding right\\" with furthering the monotheism that he taught.GORDON, SARAH. \\"GOVERNING BY THE HISBA.\\" GENDER, LAW, AND SECURITY (2019): 59. = Views on Divine Attributes = He interpreted the divine attributes in a literal, sometimes anthropomorphic sense, affirming Wajh Allah (the divine countenance), as a literal face, Ayn Allah (the divine eye) as a literal eye, Yad Allah (the divine hand) as a literal hand. He stated that God sat on the throne - describing Istiwa as Istaqarra (settlement), although he states that he did this before creating the creation. Closer inspection of his Tafsir yields that he inclined towards anthropomorphist interpretation of the Kursi (throne) and the right side of God (as well as the seeing of God which is seen as anthropomorphic by the Mu'tazila who thought God can only be seen if he is a Jism (body)). Other views reported from Muqatil is that he said that God spoke through his mouth to Moses and he reportedly narrated the following Hadith: More extreme views were allegedly held by him, including that God possessed bodily parts such as flesh, blood, hair, bones etc. Muslim scholars were so convinced of Muqatil's extreme anthropomorphism that they even came up with the term \\"Muqatiliyyah\\" to designate a sect which allegedly followed Muqatil in such views.Tohe, Achmad. Muqatil ibn Sulayman: A neglected figure in the early history of Qur'ƒÅnic commentary. Diss. Boston University, 2015. p. 12 Al-Ash'ari reports that Muqatil and Dawud al-Jawabiri, said that God is a body and possesses an image like a human being with flesh, blood, hair, bones and limbs such as hand, leg, head, and eyes, though he states that they said that with all of these he is completely unlike the creation, and that the creation does not resemble him.Tohe, Achmad. Muqatil ibn Sulayman: A neglected figure in the early history of Qur'ƒÅnic commentary. Diss. Boston University, 2015. p. 33 = Clash with Jahm bin Safwan = There was an intense theological and political debate that took place in the mosque of Marw between Muqatil and Jahm bin Safwan (d. 128 H/ 746 CE), regarding the divine attributes and a dispute between two political figures that Muqatil and Jahm were affiliated with. Each of them ended up writing a book refuting the other, and Muqatil used his political links to get Jahm expelled from Balkh, having him sent to Termez. In 128 H, in a subsequent battle with Muqatil's sponsor, Jahm was killed. The accusations of anthropomorphism against Muqatil were seen as the logical opposite to those who held the negationist views of Jahm, to whom the term \\"Jahmiyyah\\" was used (as the opposite of \\"Muqatiliyyah\\"). The Sunni Muslims thus positioned themselves in the middle, between the two extremes, neither negating God's attributes nor likening them to the creation.Tohe, Achmad.

There is however unanimous consensus that Muqatil was not a scholar of Hadith. He did not use the isnaads (chains of narration) properly. Amidst the scholars of Islam, Muqatil's reputation is that of a storyteller. The Muhaddith Ibn Hibban (d. 354 H), author of the Sahih, summarised the opinions of the early generations on Muqatil thus, \\"He relied on Jewish and Christian sources in his interpretation of the Qur æƒÅn; he was also an anthropomorphist assimilating God to His creatures; and in addition he used to forge ·∏•adƒ´ths\\"Ibn ·∏§ibbƒÅn, Majr≈´·∏•ƒ´n, 2/348-49.Ibn KhallikƒÅn, WafayƒÅt, 5/256-57.al-Mizzƒ´, Tahdhƒ´b, 28/450.Tohe, Achmad.

Muqatil ibn Sulayman: A neglected figure in the early history of Qur'ƒÅnic commentary. Diss. Boston University, 2015. p. 12 Ignoring theology and Hadith, Muslim scholars however were at times positive about his contributions to Tafsir (exegesis of the Qur'an). Ibn Hajar (d. 852 H) for instance, who repudiates him as a liar and anthropomorphist, nevertheless brings positive comments on his Tafsir and other scholars were known to do this. Early exegete Al-Tabari (d. 310 H) even quoted his view on the mysterious letters in the Qur'an as numerical counts, but was reluctant to name Muqatil as his source, stating he was among those whose views were not to be trusted. This could suggest that Muqatil's reputation had become so tainted, that few were willing to be associated with him by al-Tabari's time.Tohe, Achmad.

Boston University, 2015. pp. 31, 37 = Ibn Taymiyyah's View = Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 728 H) however rejects the theological criticisms of Muqatil, arguing that those who criticised him, took their material from his enemies, specifically Al-Ash'ari was to blame for taking Maqalat from the works of the Mutazila. He also rejected the accusation of anthropomophism for Muqatil, saying he could not find any traces of anything he would consider anthropomorphic in Muqatil's works, and therefore he could not be an anthropomorphist.Tohe, Achmad.

History There is some evidence of the presence of a small number of Koreans in Australia as early as 1920. While it is unclear what prompted their arrival they may have been the children of Australian Protestant missionaries who began work in Korea around 1885. A few also came to Australia between 1921 and 1941 for education. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia (CC BY 3.0 AU) license.. During World War II (1941-1945), an unknown number of Koreans who had been arrested in Allied countries across the Asia-Pacific Region were transported to Australia and interned alongside Japanese and Formosans for the duration of the war. Most Korean internees carried Japanese names, and were thus difficult to identify. When the Korean War ended, some Korean women came to Australia as war brides and children as orphans, adopted by Australian families. The relaxation of immigration restrictions in the late 1960s provided the first opportunity for larger numbers of Koreans to enter Australia. In 1969, the first Korean immigrants arrived in Sydney under the Skilled Migration Program. However, there were only 468 Korean born people recorded as living in Australia at the time of the 1971 Census. In the early 1970s, about 1000 Koreans arrived each year for short-term stays (mostly as students) and around 100 arrived for permanent residence. Some of these new arrivals subsequently sponsored family members for migration. Between 1976 and 1985, around 500 Korea-born immigrants arrived each year resulting in the number of Korea-born living in Australia increasing more than sixfold between the 1976 Census (1460) and the 1986 Census (9290). From 1986 to 1991, there was a further increase in settler arrivals, with an average of about 1400 each year, many coming under the Skilled and Business migration categories.

Life The son of William Winter and great- grandson of Admiral Sir William Winter, he was born in 1622 or 1623, and went to India about 1630, probably under the charge of an elder brother, Thomas, who was chief of the Masulipatnam factory in 1647. In 1655 Edward Winter was appointed to the same post, but three years later he was dismissed, whereupon he returned to England, reaching London in the summer of 1660. He had amassed a considerable fortune, and, as he brought home his wife and family, he probably had no intention of going again to the east. The East India Company, however, in reorganising their affairs upon the grant of their new charter (1661), needed the services of an energetic man versed in the affairs of the Coromandel Coast, and were willing to forget their former grievances against his private trading. Accordingly, by a commission dated 20 February 1661‚Äì2, Winter (who had been knighted at Whitehall on the 13th of that month) was appointed the eighth agent at Fort St. George on an agreement to serve for three years from the date of his arrival (22 September 1662). During his tenure, he obtained permanent agreement regarding the English rights over Madras. However, soon he aroused the ire of the local factors by allegedly adopting a threatening attitude against the Sultan of Golconda in response to the extravagant duties imposed by the former. He complained about the irregularity of the duties to a Naik of the Sultan of Golconda who responded by saying that \\"when the English horns and teeth grew, then he would free them from their duties\\". Soon afterwards, Winter was accused of private trade by the factors of the EIC who referred the matter to the company's directors. Winter offered to vacate his seat, supremely confident that the directors would not accept his resignation. However, his resignation was accepted and George Foxcroft was appointed as the Agent in his place. Foxcroft was the opposite of Winter in character and personality. While Winter was a man of good integrity, Foxcroft was not. Ultimately, disputes broke out between the two, and three months later, Winter attacked Foxcroft, his son and one Mr. Sambroke. Foxcroft and Sambroke were arrested and kept in confinement for sedition. Winter assumed command of the garrison at Fort St. George and wrote to the king of England and the Archbishop of Canterbury explaining his action as a measure against the puritanical and anti-Royalist activities of Foxcroft. Foxcroft, meanwhile, appealed to the Agent of Masulipatnam and the President of Surat, as well as the Sultan of Golconda for help. The authorities at Masulipatnam and Surat as well as the Directors of the Company remonstrated with Winter but nothing came of it. The directors came to the conclusion that Winter had sided with the Dutch and when peace was concluded with the Dutch under the Treaty of Breda on 10 May 1668, threats were issued for a British invasion of Fort St. George and the adjoining Portuguese town of St. Thome. However, Edward Winter was adamant under the assumption that the King of England supported him. On 21 May 1668 two ships belonging to the Company arrived at Madras and arrested two members of the Council of Fort St George whom Winter had sent to negotiate with the Company troops. Winter was issued an ultimatum in the name of the King of England and he surrendered and George Foxcroft was reinstated. However, within a year of the reinstatement, Foxcroft as well as Winter were asked to leave for England. George Foxcroft, who was the first to be given the title 'Governor of Fort St. George'. Personal life He was twice married. The name of his first wife (whom he married in the East Indies) has not been traced; his second wife, whom he married on 20 December 1682, was Emma Withe or Wyeth, widow, daughter of Richard Howe of Norfolk.

Horses in the Middle Ages differed in size, build and breed from the modern horse, and were, on average, smaller. They were also more central to society than their modern counterparts, being essential for war, agriculture, and transport. Consequently, specific types of horse developed, many of which have no modern equivalent. While an understanding of modern horse breeds and equestrianism is vital for any analysis of the medieval horse, researchers also need to consider documentary (both written and pictorial) and archaeological evidence. Horses in the Middle Ages were rarely differentiated by breed, but rather by use. This led them to be described, for example, as \\"chargers\\" (war horses), \\"palfreys\\" (riding horses), cart horses or packhorses. Reference is also given to their place of origin, such as \\"Spanish horses,\\" but whether this referred to one breed or several is unknown. Another difficulty arising during any study of medieval documents or literature is the flexibility of the medieval languages, where several words can be used for one thing (or, conversely, several objects are referred to by one word). Words such as 'courser' and 'charger' are used interchangeably (even within one document), and where one epic may speak disparagingly of a rouncey, another praises its skill and swiftness. Significant technological advances in equestrian equipment, often introduced from other cultures, allowed for significant changes in both warfare and agriculture. In particular, improved designs for the solid-treed saddle as well as the arrival of the stirrup, horseshoe and horse collar were significant advances in medieval society. Consequently, the assumptions and theories developed by historians are not definitive, and debate still rages on many issues, such as the breeding or size of the horse, and a number of sources must be consulted in order to understand the breadth of the subject. Breeding This 15th-century battle scene shows the powerfully-built horses used in warfare. During the decline of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages, much of the quality breeding stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled breeding and had to be built up again over the following centuries.Carey et al., p. 112 In the west, this may have been due in part to the reliance of the British and Scandinavians on infantry-based warfare, where horses were only used for riding and pursuit.Bennet et al., pp. 19-21 However, there were exceptions; in the 7th century a Merovingian kingdom still retained at least one active Roman horse breeding centre.Nicolle, p. 267 The Spanish also retained many quality horses, in part due to the historic reputation of the region as a horse-breeding land, and partially due to the cultural influences related to the Islamic conquest of the Iberian peninsula between the 8th and 15th centuries.Bennett (1998), Needs page numbers The origins of the medieval war horse are obscure, although it is believed they had some Barb and Arabian blood through the Spanish Jennet, a forerunner to the modern Friesian and Andalusian horse.Bennett, Deb (2004) \\"The Spanish Mustang: The Origin and Relationships of the Mustang, Barb, and Arabian Horse\\" . Frank Hopkins. Retrieved 2008-08-14. It is also possible that other sources of oriental bloodstock came from what was called the Nisaean breed (possibly akin to the Turkoman horse) from Iran and Anatolia, another type of oriental horse brought back from the Crusades. \\"Spanish\\" horses, whatever their breeding, were the most expensive. In fact, in Germany the word spanjol became the term for quality war horses. However, German literary sources also refer to fine horses from Scandinavia.Bumke, p. 178 France also produced good war horses. Some scholars attribute this to the strong Feudal society there,Gies & Gies, p. 88 but an equally probable explanation is the historic influence of the Roman horse breeding traditions preserved by the Merovingians, combined with the addition of valuable Spanish and oriental bloodstock captured in the wake of the victory of Charles Martel over the Islamic Umayyad invaders at the Battle of Tours in 732.British Percheron Horse Society. \\"History of the British Percheron Horse Society\\". British Percheron Horse Society. Retrieved 2008-08-14. Following this battle, the Carolingians began to increase their heavy cavalry, which resulted in the seizure of land (for fodder production), and a change in tribute payment from cattle to horses.Bennet et al., pp. 71-72 Mughal nobleman (Sowar) on horseback. As the importance of horse breeding to successful warfare was realized, planned breeding programs increased. Many changes were due to the influence of Islamic culture through both the Crusades and the Moorish invasions of Spain; the Arabs kept extensive pedigrees of their Barb and Arabian horses via an oral tradition. Some of the earliest written pedigrees in recorded European history were kept by Carthusian monks, who were among those who bred the Spanish Jennet. Because they could read and write, thus kept careful records, monastics were given the responsibility for horse breeding by certain members of the nobility, particularly in Spain. In England, a common source of warhorses were the wild moorland ponies, which were rounded up annually by horse-breeders, including the Cistercians, for use as campaign riding horses, or light cavalry; one such breed was the Fell pony, which had similar ancestry to the Friesian horse.Hyland (1998), p. 15 It is also hard to trace what happened to the bloodlines of destriers when this type seems to disappear from record during the 17th century.Prestwich, p. 30 Many modern draft breeds claim some link to the medieval \\"great horse,\\" with some historians considering breeds such as the Percheron, Belgian and Suffolk Punch likely descendants of the destrier. However, other historians discount this theory, since the historical record suggests the medieval warhorse was quite a different 'type' to the modern draught horse.See e.g.: Clark, p. 23 and Prestwich, p. 30 Such a theory would suggest the war horses were crossed once again with \\"cold blooded\\" work horses, since war horses, and the destrier in particular, were renowned for their hot-blooded nature.Carey et al., p. 113 =Types of horse= Throughout the period, horses were rarely considered breeds, but instead were defined by type: by describing their purpose or their physical attributes. Many of the definitions were not precise, or were interchangeable. Prior to approximately the 13th century, few pedigrees were written down. Thus, many terms for horses in the Middle Ages did not refer to breeds as we know them today, but rather described appearance or purpose. Medieval people engaging in falconry from horseback. The horses appear to have the body type of palfreys or jennets. from the Codex Manesse. One of the best- known of the medieval horses was the destrier, renowned and admired for its capabilities in war. It was well trained, and was required to be strong, fast and agile. A 14th-century writer described them as \\"tall and majestic and with great strength\\".Eustach Deschamps, 1360, quoted by Oakeshott (1998), p. 11 In contemporary sources, the destrier was frequently referred to as the \\"great horse\\" because of its size and reputation.Oakeshott (1998), p. 11 Being a subjective term, it gives no firm information about its actual height or weight, but since the average horse of the time was ,Clark, p. 29 a \\"great horse\\" by medieval standards might appear small to our modern eyes. The destrier was highly prized by knights and men-at-arms, but was actually not very common, and appears to have been most suited to the joust. Coursers were generally preferred for hard battle as they were light, fast and strong. They were valuable, but not as costly as the destrier. They were also used frequently for hunting.Hyland (1998), p. 221 A more general-purpose horse was the rouncey (also rounsey), which could be kept as a riding horse or trained for war. It was commonly used by squires, men-at-arms or poorer knights. A wealthy knight would keep rounceys for his retinue. Sometimes the expected nature of warfare dictated the choice of horse; when a summons to war was sent out in England, in 1327, it expressly requested rounceys, for swift pursuit, rather than destriers.Prestwich, p. 318 Rounceys were sometimes used as pack horses (but never as cart horses).Hyland (1998), p. 222 The well-bred palfrey, which could equal a destrier in price, was popular with nobles and highly ranked knights for riding, hunting and ceremonial use.Oakeshott (1998), p. 14 Ambling was a desirable trait in a palfrey, as the smooth gait allowed the rider to cover long distances quickly in relative comfort. Other horse types included the jennet, a small horse first bred in Spain from Barb and Arabian bloodstock. Their quiet and dependable nature, as well as size, made them popular as riding horses for ladies; however, they were also used as cavalry horses by the Spanish. The hobby was a lightweight horse, about , developed in Ireland from Spanish or Libyan (Barb) bloodstock. This type of quick and agile horse was popular for skirmishing, and was often ridden by light cavalry known as Hobelars. Hobbies were used successfully by both sides during the Wars of Scottish Independence, with Edward I of England trying to gain advantage by preventing Irish exports of the horses to Scotland. Robert Bruce employed the hobby for his guerilla warfare and mounted raids, covering a day.Hyland (1998), pp. 32, 14, 37 Horses in warfare Carolingian warrior on a war horse with lance, round shield, chainmail and spangenhelm, 8th century While light cavalry had been used in warfare for many centuries, the medieval era saw the rise of heavy cavalry, particularly the European knight. Historians are uncertain when the use of heavy cavalry in the form of mounted shock troops first occurred, but the technique had become widespread by the mid-12th century. The heavy cavalry charge itself was not a common occurrence in warfare.Prestwich, p. 325 Pitched battles were avoided if at all possible, with most offensive warfare in the early Middle Ages taking the form of sieges,Bennet et al., p. 121 or swift mounted raids called chevauch√©es, with the warriors lightly armed on swift horses and their heavy war horses safely in the stable.Chevauch√©es were the preferred form of warfare for the English during the Hundred Years' War (see, amongst many, Barber, pp. 34-38) and the Scots in the Wars of Independence (see Prestwich, pp. 10, 198-200) Pitched battles were sometimes unavoidable, but were rarely fought on land suitable for heavy cavalry. While mounted riders remained effective for initial attacks,Barber, p. 33 by the 14th century, it was common for knights to dismount to fight.Prestwich, p 31 Horses were sent to the rear, and kept ready for pursuit.Sadler, p. 32 By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles became more common, probably because of the success of infantry tactics and changes in weaponry.Bennet et al., p. 123 However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses. Throughout the period, light horse, or prickers, were used for scouting and reconnaissance; they also provided a defensive screen for marching armies. Large teams of draught horses, or oxen, were used for pulling the heavy early cannon.Sadler, p. 45 Other horses pulled wagons and carried supplies for the armies. =Tournaments= joust Tournaments and hastiludes began in the 11th century as both a sport and to provide training for battle. Usually taking the form of a melee, the participants used the horses, armour and weapons of war.Barker, pp. 4-15 The sport of jousting grew out of the tournament and, by the 15th century, the art of tilting became quite sophisticated.Oakeshott (1998), pp. 79‚Äì83 In the process, the pageantry and specialization became less war-like, perhaps because of the knight's changing role in war.Barber, p. 42 Horses were specially bred for the joust, and heavier horse armour developed. However, this did not necessarily lead to significantly larger horses. Interpreters at the Royal Armouries, Leeds, re-created the joust, using specially bred horses and replica armour. Their horses accurately represented the medieval mount, being compactly built and not particularly tall. =Types of war horse= left The most well-known horse of the medieval era of Europe is the destrier, known for carrying knights into war. However, most knights and mounted men-at-arms rode smaller horses known as coursers and rounceys. (A common generic name for medieval war horses was charger, which was interchangeable with the other terms). In Spain, the jennet was used as a light cavalry horse.Oakeshott (1998), pp. 11-14 Stallions were often used as war horses in Europe due to their natural aggression and hot-blooded tendencies. A 13th-century work describes destriers \\"biting and kicking\\" on the battlefield,Bumke, p. 175 and, in the heat of battle, war horses were often seen fighting each other.Hyland (1998), pp. 1-2 However, the use of mares by European warriors cannot be discounted from literary references.Bumke, p. 177 Mares were the preferred war horse of the Moors.Edwards Needs page numbers They also were preferred by the Mongols.Greene, R. and Elffers, J. The 33 Strategies of War, p. 181. War horses were more expensive than normal riding horses, and destriers the most prized, but figures vary greatly from source to source. Destriers are given a values ranging from seven times the price of an ordinary horse to 700 times. The Bohemian king Wenzel II rode a horse \\"valued at one thousand marks\\" in 1298. At the other extreme, a 1265 French ordinance ruled that a squire could not spend more than twenty marks on a rouncey.Oakeshott (1998), p. 12 Knights were expected to have at least one war horse (as well as riding horses and packhorses), with some records from the later Middle Ages showing knights bringing twenty-four horses on campaign. Five horses was perhaps the standard.Nicolle, p. 169 =Size of war horses= There is dispute in medievalist circles over the size of the war horse, with some notable historians claiming a size of , as large as a modern Shire horse.Davis However, there are practical reasons for this dispute. Analysis of existing horse armour located in the Royal Armouries indicates the equipment was originally worn by horses of ,study by Ann Hyland, quoted by Clark, p. 23 or about the size and build of a modern field hunter or ordinary riding horse.Gravett, p. 59 Research undertaken at the Museum of London, using literary, pictorial and archaeological sources, supports military horses of , distinguished from a riding horse by its strength and skill, rather than its size.Clark, p. 25 This average does not seem to vary greatly across the medieval period. Horses appear to have been selectively bred for increased size from the 9th and 10th centuries,Hyland (1994), pp. 58-59 and by the 11th century the average warhorse was probably , a size verified by studies of Norman horseshoes as well as the depictions of horses on the Bayeux Tapestry.Hyland (1994), pp. 85-86 Analysis of horse transports suggests 13th- century destriers were a stocky build, and no more than .Hyland (1994), pp. 146 Three centuries later, warhorses were not significantly bigger; the Royal Armouries used a Lithuanian Heavy Draught mare as a model for the statues displaying various 15th- and 16th-century horse armours, as her body shape was an excellent fit.Hyland (1998), p. 10 Royal Armoury, Stockholm Perhaps one reason for the pervasive belief that the medieval war horse had to be of draught horse type is the assumption, still held by many, that medieval armour was heavy. In fact, even the heaviest tournament armour (for knights) weighed little more than , and field (war) armour ; barding, or horse armour, rarely weighed more than .Oakeshott (1998), pp. 104-105 Allowing for the weight of the rider and other equipment, horses can carry approximately 30% of their weight; thus such loads could certainly be carried by a heavy riding horse in the range, and a draught horse was not needed.American Endurance Riders Conference, \\"Endurance Rider's Handbook, Chapter 3, Section IV\\" , American Endurance Riders Conference, Retrieved 2008-08-14. Although a large horse is not required to carry an armoured knight, it is held by some historians that a large horse was desirable to increase the power of a lance strike.International Museum of the Horse, \\"Medieval Horse 476 - c. 1450: Knight versus Moor\\", International Museum of the Horse, Retrieved 2012-05-24 However, practical experiments by re-enactors have suggested that the rider's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the lance.Alvarez, Richard. \\"Saddle, Lance and Stirrup: An Examination of the Mechanics of Shock Combat and the Development of Shock Tactics\\" . Classical Fencing. Retrieved 2007-03-08. Further evidence for a 14-16 hand () war horse is that it was a matter of pride to a knight to be able to vault onto his horse in full armour, without touching the stirrup. This arose not from vanity, but necessity: if unhorsed during battle, a knight would remain vulnerable if unable to mount by himself. In reality, of course, a wounded or weary knight might find it difficult, and rely on a vigilant squire to assist him. Incidentally, a knight's armour served in his favour in any fall. With his long hair twisted on his head to form a springy padding under his padded-linen hood, and his helm placed on top, he had head protection not dissimilar to a modern bicycle or equestrian helmet.Oakeshott (1999), p. 92 Transportation A horse litter Throughout the Middle Ages it was customary for people of all classes and background to travel, often widely. The households of the upper classes and royal courts moved between manors and estates; the demands of diplomacy, war and crusades took men to distant countries; priests travelled between churches, monasteries and formed emissaries to Rome; people of all classes went on pilgrimage, or travelled to find work; others travelled as a pastime.Labarge, pp. xiii-xiv Most people undertook small journeys on foot and hired horses for longer journeys.Clark, p. 8 For the upper classes, travel was accompanied by a great deal of pomp and display, with fine horses, large retinues and magnificent cavalcades in order to display their wealth as well as to ensure personal comfort.Labarge, p. xiii For example, in 1445, the English royal household contained 60 horses in the king's stable and 186 kept for \\"chariots\\" (carriages) and carts. During much of the Middle Ages, there was no system of interconnected roads and bridges. Though parts of Europe still had remnants of Roman roads built before the collapse of the Roman Empire, most had long fallen into disrepair.Nicolle, p. 267 Because of the necessity to ride long distances over uncertain roads, smooth-gaited horses were preferred, and most ordinary riding horses were of greater value if they could do one of the smooth but ground-covering four-beat gaits collectively known as an amble rather than the more jarring trot. Mule trains, for land travel, and barges, for river and canal travel, were the most common form of long-distance haulage, although wheeled horse-drawn vehicles were used for shorter journeys.Tuchman, p. 57 In areas with good roads, regular carrier services were established between major towns.Clark, pp. 9-10 However, because medieval roads were generally so poor, carriages for human passengers were rare. When roads permitted, early carriages were developed from freight wagons. Carriage travel was made more comfortable in the late 14th century with the introduction of the chariot branlant, which had strap suspension.Gies & Gies, p. 56 The speed of travel varied greatly. Large retinues could be slowed by the presence of slow-paced carts and litters, or by servants and attendants on foot, and could rarely cover more than fifteen to twenty miles a day. Small mounted companies might travel 30 miles a day. However, there were exceptions: stopping only for a change of horses midway, Richard II of England once managed the 70 miles between Daventry and Westminster in a night.Labarge, p. 19 For breeding, war and travel purposes, it was also necessary to be able to transport horses themselves. For this purpose, boats were adapted and built to be used as horse transports. William of Normandy's invasion of England in 1066 required the transfer of over 2000 horses from Normandy.Hyland (1994), p. 99 Similarly, when travelling to France in 1285‚Äì6, Edward I of England ferried over 1000 horses across the English Channel to provide the royal party with transport.Clark, p. 6 =Riding horses= A 13th-century depiction of a riding horse. Riding horses were used by a variety of people during the Middle Ages, and so varied greatly in quality, size and breeding. Knights and nobles kept riding horses in their war-trains, saving their warhorses for the battle. The names of horses referred to a type of horse, rather than a breed. Many horses were named by the region where they or their immediate ancestors were foaled. For example, in Germany, Hungarian horses were commonly used for riding. Individual horses were often described by their gait ('trotters' or 'amblers'), by their colouring, or by the name of their breeder.Oakeshott (1998), p. 14 and Prestwich, p. 31 The most typical riding horse was known as a rouncy. It was relatively small and inexpensive. The best riding horses were known as palfreys; another breed of horse was developed in the 14th century in England called a hackney, from which the modern term \\"hack\\" is derived. Because the hackney had a trotting gate it was not considered a comfortable ride for most purposes. Women sometimes rode rouncies, palfreys or small horses known as jennets. =Harness and pack horses= A variety of work horses were used throughout the Middle Ages. The pack horse (or \\"sumpter horse\\") carried equipment and belongings. Common riding horses, often called \\"hackneys\\", could be used as pack horses. Cart horses pulled wagons for trading and freight haulage, on farms, or as part of a military campaign. These draught horses were smaller than their modern counterparts; pictorial and archaeological evidence suggests that they were stout but short, approximately , and capable of drawing a load of per horse.Clark, pp. 27-28 Four-wheeled wagons and two-wheeled carts were more common in towns, such as London and, depending on type of vehicle and weight of the load, were usually pulled by teams of two, three, or four horses harnessed in tandem. Starting in the 12th century, in England the use of oxen to pull carts was gradually superseded by the use of horses, a process that extended through the 13th century. This change came because horse-drawn transport moved goods quicker and over greater distances than ox-drawn methods of transport.Dyer Making a Living p. 129 Agriculture This horse is fitted with a horse collar to bear the weight of the harrow.October, Les Tr√®s Riches Heures du duc de Berry The Romans had used a two-field crop rotation agricultural system, but from the 8th century on, a three-field system became more common. One field would be sown with a winter crop, the second with a spring crop, and the third left fallow. This allowed a greater amount of spring crop of oats to be grown, which provided fodder for horses.Slocum, pp. 140-1 Another advance during the Middle Ages was the development of the heavy mouldboard plough, which allowed dense and heavy soils to be tilled easily; this technology required the use of larger teams of draught animals including oxen and horses, as well as the adoption of larger fields.Slocum, pp. 141-2 Particularly after the 12th century, the increased use of both the horse collar and use of iron horse shoes allowed horsepower to be directed more efficiently.Slocum, p. 143 Horse teams usually were four horses, or perhaps six, as compared to eight oxen, and the lesser numbers compensated for the fact that the horses needed to be fed grain on top of pasture, unlike oxen. The increased speed of horses also allowed more land to be ploughed in a day, with an eight ox plough team averaging half of an acre per day, but a horse team averaged a full acre per day. For farm work, such as ploughing and harrowing, the draught horses utilized for these purposes were, in England, called 'affers' and 'stotts' (affrus and stottus in medieval Latin). These horses were usually smaller and cheaper than the cart horse. The difference between affers and stotts was largely nominal. Medieval English records from south-east England and East Anglia typically use the term 'stott', while 'affer' is used in documents from across the rest of the country. While oxen were traditionally used as work animals on farms, horses began to be used in greater numbers after the development of the horse collar.Chamberlin Oxen and horses were sometimes harnessed together. The transition from oxen to horses for farm work was documented in pictorial sources (for example, the 11th-century Bayeux tapestry depicts working horses), and also clear from the change from the Roman two- field crop-rotation system to a new three-field system, which increased the cultivation of fodder crops (predominantly oats, barley and beans).Gies & Gies, pp. 128, 147 Horses were also used to process crops; they were used to turn the wheels in mills (such as corn mills), and transport crops to market.Gies & Gies, p. 273 The change to horse-drawn teams also meant a change in ploughs, as horses were more suited to a wheeled plough, unlike oxen. Equestrian equipment and technological innovations Detail from 15th- century painting by Gentile da Fabriano, showing curb bits, with ornamental bosses at the sides of the mouthpiece The development of equestrian technology proceeded at a similar pace as the development of horse breeding and utilisation. The changes in warfare during the Early Middle Ages to heavy cavalry both precipitated and relied on the arrival of the stirrup, solid- treed saddle, and horseshoe from other cultures. The development of the nailed horseshoe enabled longer, faster journeys on horseback, particularly in the wetter lands in northern Europe, and were useful for campaigns on varied terrains.Bennet et al., p. 74 By providing protection and support, nailed horse shoes also improved the efficiency of draught horse teams. Though the Romans had developed an iron \\"hipposandal\\" that resembled a hoof boot, there is much debate over the actual origins of the nailed horseshoe, though it does appear to be of European origin. There is little evidence of nailed-on shoes prior to AD 500 or 600, though there is speculation that the Celtic Gauls were the first to nail on metal horseshoes.McBane, pp. 57-60 The earliest clear written record of iron horseshoes is a reference to \\"crescent figured irons and their nails\\" in a list of cavalry equipment from AD 910.Heymering, Henry, RJF, CJF, \\"Who Invented Horseshoeing?\\", Science of Motion, Retrieved on 2011-11-06. Additional archaeological evidence suggests they were used in Siberia during the 9th and 10th centuries, and had spread to Byzantium soon afterward; by the 11th century, horseshoes were commonly used in Europe.Slocum, pp. 143-4 By the time the Crusades began in 1096, horseshoes were widespread and frequently mentioned in various written sources. =Riding technology= The saddle with a solid tree provided a bearing surface to protect the horse from the weight of the rider. The Romans are credited with the invention of the solid-treed saddle, possibly as early as the 1st century BC,Gawronski, \\"Some Remarks on the Origins and Construction of the Roman Military Saddle\\", Archeologia (Archaeology), pp. 31-40 and it was widespread by the 2nd century AD.Hope, Chapters 1 and 2 Early medieval saddles resembled the Roman \\"four-horn\\" saddle, and were used without stirrups.Oakeshott (1998), p. 40 The development of the solid saddle tree was significant; it raised the rider above the horse's back, and distributed the rider's weight, reducing the pounds per square inch carried on any one part of the horse's back, thus greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life. Horses could carry more weight when distributed across a solid saddle tree. It also allowed a more built up seat to give the rider greater security in the saddle. From the 12th century on, the high war-saddle became more common, providing protection as well as added security. The built up cantle of a solid-treed saddle enabled horsemen to use lance more effectively. Beneath the saddle, caparisons or saddle cloths were sometimes worn; these could be decorated or embroidered with heraldic colours and arms.Wagner et al., p. 65 War horses could be equipped with additional covers, blankets and armour collectively referred to as barding; this could be for decorative or protective purposes. Early forms of horse armour, usually restricted to tournaments, comprised padded leather pieces, covered by a trapper (a decorated cloth), which was not particularly heavy.Barker, pp. 175-6 Mail and plate armour was also occasionally used; there are literary references to horse armour (an \\"iron blanket\\") starting in the late 12th century.Bumke, p. 176 The solid tree allowed for effective use of the stirrup. The stirrup was developed in China and in widespread use there by 477 AD.Hobson, p. 103 By the 7th century, primarily due to invaders from Central Asia, such as the Avars, stirrups arrived in Europe,ComputerSmiths, \\"Stirrup\\" , History of Chinese Invention, ComputerSmiths, Retrieved 2006-12-04. and European riders had adopted them by the 8th century.Dien, Albert, \\"The Stirrup and its Effect on Chinese Military History\\", Silkroad Foundation, Retrieved 2008-08-14. Among other advantages, stirrups provided greater balance and support to the rider, which allowed the knight to use a sword more efficiently without falling, especially against infantry. The increased use of the stirrup from the 8th century on aided the warrior's stability and security in the saddle when fighting.Bennet et al., pp. 73-4 This may have led to greater use of shock tactics, although a couched lance could be used effectively without stirrups. In particular, Charles Martel recognized the military potential of the stirrup, and distributed seized lands to his retainers on condition that they serve him by fighting in the new manner.World Decade for Cultural Development 1988‚Äì1997. United Nations Page 31 Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. World Decade Secretariat. A theory known as The Great Stirrup Controversy argues that the advantages in warfare that stemmed from use of the stirrup led to the birth of feudalism itself.White, Needs page numbers Other scholars, however, dispute this assertion, suggesting that stirrups provided little advantage in shock warfare, being useful primarily for allowing a rider to lean farther to the left and right on the saddle while fighting, and simply reduce the risk of falling off. Therefore, it is argued, they are not the reason for the switch from infantry to cavalry in Medieval militaries, nor the reason for the emergence of Feudalism.see, e.g. D. A. Bullough, English Historical Review (1970) and Bernard S. Bachrach, \\"Charles Martel, Mounted Shock Combat, the Stirrup, and Feudalism\\" in Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History (1970). There was a variety of headgear used to control horses, predominantly bridles with assorted designs of bits. Many of the bits used during the Middle Ages resemble the bradoon, snaffle bit and curb bit that are still in common use today. However, they often were decorated to a greater degree: the bit rings or shanks were frequently covered with large, ornamental \\"bosses.\\" Some designs were also more extreme and severe than those used today.The curb bit was known during the classical period, but was not generally used during the Middle Ages until the mid-14th century.Oakeshott (1998), p. 38 Some styles of snaffle bit used during the Middle Ages had the lower cheek extended, in the manner of the modern half-cheek or full cheek snaffle. Until the late 13th century, bridles generally had a single pair of reins; after this period it became more common for knights to use two sets of reins, similar to that of the modern double bridle, and often at least one set was decorated.Oakeshott (1998), p. 39 Spurs were commonly used throughout the period, especially by knights, with whom they were regularly associated. A young man was said to have \\"won his spurs\\" when he achieved knighthood.Barber, p. 16 Wealthy knights and riders frequently wore decorated and filigreed spurs. Attached to the rider's heel by straps, spurs could be used both to encourage horses to quickly move forward or to direct lateral movement.Wagner et al., p. 66 Early spurs had a short shanks or \\"neck\\", placing the rowel relatively close to the rider's heel; further developments in the spur shape lengthened the neck, making it easier to touch the horse with less leg movement on the part of the rider.Wagner et al., p. 67 =Harness technology= In this depiction of a medieval horse team, the lead pair have breast collars, while the trace pair wear horse collars. Note that one horse is saddled. A significant development which increased the importance and use of horses in harness, particularly for ploughing and other farm work, was the horse collar. The horse collar was invented in China during the 5th century, arrived in Europe during the 9th century,Chamberlin, Needs page number and became widespread throughout Europe by the 12th century.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 317. It allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle by means of yokes or breastcollars used in earlier times.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 322. The yoke was designed for oxen and not suited to the anatomy of horses, it required horses to pull with their shoulders rather than using the power of their hindquarters. Harnessed in such a manner, horse teams could pull no more than 500 kg. The breastplate-style harness that had flat straps across the neck and chest of the animal, while useful for pulling light vehicles, was of little use for heavy work. These straps pressed against the horse's sterno-cephalicus muscle and trachea, which restricted breathing and reduced the pulling power of the horse.Needham, Volume 4, part 2, 305 Two horses harnessed with a breastcollar harness were limited to pulling a combined total of about .Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 312 In contrast, the horse collar rested on horses' shoulders and did not impede breathing. It allowed a horse to use its full strength, by pushing forward with its hindquarters into the collar rather than to pull with its shoulders. With the horse collar, a horse could provide a work effort of 50% more foot- pounds per second than an ox, because it could move at a greater speed, as well as having generally greater endurance and the ability to work more hours in a day. A single horse with a more efficient collar harness could draw a weight of about . A further improvement was managed by altering the arrangement of the teams; by hitching horses one behind the other, rather than side by side, weight could be distributed more evenly, and pulling power increased.Gimpel, p. 34 This increase in horse power is demonstrated in the building accounts of Troyes, which show carters hauling stone from quarries distant; the carts weighed, on average, , on which of stone was regularly loaded, sometimes increasing to ‚Äì a significant increase from Roman-era loads.Gimpel, p. 32 Horse trades and professions The elite horseman of the Middle Ages was the knight. Generally raised from the middle and upper classes, the knight was trained from childhood in the arts of war and management of the horse. In most languages, the term for knight reflects his status as a horseman: the French chevalier, Spanish caballero and German Ritter. The French word for horse-mastery ‚Äì chevalerie ‚Äì gave its name to the highest concept of knighthood: chivalry.Norman, p. 143 A large number of trades and positions arose to ensure the appropriate management and care of horses. In aristocratic households, the marshal was responsible for all aspects relating to horses: the care and management of all horses from the chargers to the pack horses, as well as all travel logistics.Labarge, p. 41 The position of marshal (literally \\"horse servant\\") was a high one in court circles and the king's marshal (such as the Earl Marshal in England) was also responsible for managing many military matters.Norman, p. 133 Also present within the great households was the constable (or \\"count of the stable\\"), who was responsible for protection and the maintenance of order within the household and commanding the military component and, with marshals, might organise hastiludes and other chivalrous events.Norman, pp. 132‚Äì3 Within lower social groupings, the 'marshal' acted as a farrier.Clark, pp. 14‚Äì15 The highly skilled marshal made and fitted horseshoes, cared for the hoof, and provided general veterinary care for horses; throughout the Middle Ages, a distinction was drawn between the marshal and the blacksmith, whose work was more limited.Clark, pp 15‚Äì16 A number of tradesmen dealt with the provision of horses. Horse dealers (frequently called \\"horse coursers\\" in England) bought and sold horses, and frequently had a reputation as dishonest figures, responsible for the brisk trade in stolen horses.Clark, p. 8 Others, such as the \\"hackneymen\\" offered horses for hire, and many formed large establishments on busy roads, often branding their horses to deter theft. Women and horses This medieval painting shows a woman in a dress mounted on a war horse, riding astride, not sidesaddle. Depiction of a lady riding in an early sidesaddle of a design credited to Anne of Bohemia (1366-1394) ‚Äì Gerard Horenbout, 16th century. It was not uncommon for a girl to learn her father's trade and for a woman to share her husband's trade, since the entire family often helped run medieval shops and farms. Many guilds also accepted the membership of widows, so they might continue their husband's business. Under this system, some women trained in horse-related trades, and there are records of women working as farriers and saddle-makers.Leyser, pp. 162-165 and Power, p. Needs page numbers On farms, where every hand was needed, excessive emphasis on division of labour was impracticable, and women often worked alongside men (on their own farms or as hired help), leading the farm horses and oxen, and managing their care.Leyser, p. 145 Despite the difficulties of travel, it was customary for many people, including women, to travel long distances. Upper-class wives frequently accompanied their husbands on crusade or to tournaments, and many women traveled for social or family engagements; both nuns and laywomen would perform pilgrimages.Labarge, p. xiv When not on foot, women would usually travel on horseback or, if weakened or infirm, be carried in a wagon or a litter. If roads permitted, women sometimes rode in early carriages developed from freight wagons, pulled by three or four horses.Tuchman, p 57 After the invention of better suspension systems, travel in carriages became more comfortable. Women of the nobility also rode horses for sport, accompanying men in activities that included hunting and hawking.Gies & Gies, p. 42 Most medieval women rode astride. Although an early chair-like sidesaddle with handles and a footrest was available by the 13th century and allowed women of the nobility to ride while wearing elaborate gowns, they were not universally adopted during the Middle Ages. This was largely due to the insecure seat they offered, which necessitated a smooth- gaited horse being led by another handler. The sidesaddle did not become practical for everyday riding until the 16th-century development of the pommel horn that allowed a woman to hook her leg around the saddle and hence use the reins to control her own horse. Even then, sidesaddle riding remained a precarious activity until the invention of the second, \\"leaping horn\\" in the 19th century.Georgia Ladies Aside, \\"Sidesaddle History\\" . Georgia Ladies Aside. Retrieved 2011-11-06. It was not unknown for women to ride war horses, and take their part in warfare. Joan of Arc is probably the most famous female warrior of the medieval period, but there were many others, including the Empress Matilda who, armoured and mounted, led an army against her cousin Stephen of Blois, and Stephen's wife Matilda of Boulogne in the 12th century.Gies & Gies, pp. 45-46 The 15th-century writer Christine de Pizan advised aristocratic ladies that they must \\"know the laws of arms and all things pertaining to warfare, ever prepared to command her men if there is need of it.\\"de Pisan, Christine, as translated by Willard and Cosman (1989) Needs page numbers See also *Horse transports in the Middle Ages *Domestication of the horse Notes References *Barber, Richard (2005) The Reign of Chivalry, 2nd Ed.

It offered an explanation of the heliocentric model of the Universe, suggested by Nicolaus Copernicus in his 1543 work De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. The book is Fontenelle's most famous work and is considered to be one of the first major works of the Age of Enlightenment. Background Unlike many scientific works of its time, Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds was written not in Latin, but in French and is notable as one of the first books to attempt an explanation of scientific theories in popular language. In the preface, Fontenelle addresses female readers and suggests that the offered explanation should be easily understood even by those without scientific knowledge. A precursor includes Giordano Bruno's De l'infinito, universo e mondi. Content The book itself is presented as a series of conversations between a gallant philosopher and a marquise, who walk in the latter's garden at night and gaze at stars. The philosopher explains the heliocentric model and also muses on the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Fontenelle's work was not cast polemically against the world views of either the Catholic Church or the Protestant churches, nor did it attract the attention, positive or negative, of theologians or prelates. Translations The first English translation was compounded by John Glanvill in 1687, followed by another translation by Aphra Behn in 1688, under the title A Discovery of New Worlds. Antiokh Kantemir translated it into Russian in 1730, although the translation was only published in a censored edition in 1740, due to objections from the Russian Orthodox Church. Reception The book was very well received both in France and elsewhere, and was regularly published. In 1691, Fontenelle was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise.\\"Fontenelle, Bernard Le Bovier, sieur de.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 3 March 2007 .

Rebo resigned from the company in May 2014. He is currently the Managing Partner of Eclair, USA. Emerging Pictures was acquired by 20 Year Media in 2015. The stated mission of the company was to create a national alternative theatrical network out of independent venues such as art house theaters, museums and performing arts centers, connected through the use of digital technology. Emerging Pictures specializes in independent film, documentaries, foreign language films and broadcasts of cultural programming, such as opera, ballet, and Shakespeare plays.  Technology  Emerging installs its proprietary server technology into the projection booths of these theaters and delivers the films to the theaters through a dedicated data line. The company calls its technology ‚Äúi-Cinema,‚Äù named for independent and international films, and to differentiate it from Hollywood‚Äôs d-Cinema standard. Emerging‚Äôs network is currently 130 venues, and is spread out all over the U.S. It has also begun to expand into other countries and has servers in use in Latvia and Australia. Emerging‚Äôs platform provides a cost-effective way to distribute films nationally by removing the cost of making or shipping 35mm prints. Emerging‚Äôs digital network allows for more flexibility of programming by removing the physical element and thus allowing theaters to program more like a television network with different types of programming in different day parts.  Films  First-run films are provided by all the independent distributors in the U.S. including IFC Films, Sony Pictures Classics, Magnolia Pictures, Kino/Lorber Films, Zeitgeist Films and others. Older repertory titles are provided by Universal Pictures and Janus Films.  Cultural Programming  The Opera in Cinema logo. Among the most successful content in its network are cultural programs that are shown live and near-live. Its ‚ÄúOpera in Cinema‚Äù program features operas from La Scala (Milan), the Gran Teatre del Liceu (Barcelona), the Salzburg Festival and the Royal Opera House (London). ‚ÄúBallet in Cinema‚Äù includes ballets from the Bolshoi (Moscow), the Mariinsky Ballet (Saint Petersburg) and the Royal Opera House. ‚ÄúShakespeare in Cinema‚Äù features plays from Shakespeare's Globe (London). The ‚ÄúOpera in Cinema‚Äù series is considered to be the only major competition for the Met in HD broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Emerging Pictures receives its content from a number of content holders: RAI Trade, Opus Arte, Bel Air Media, C Major, and directly from the Gran Teatre del Liceu.  Distribution  In its early years, the company also used to provide marketing, distribution and exhibition services for filmmakers in the theatrical, television and home video markets. The company closed its distribution operation in 2009 to focus on building the theatrical network. The only content for which Emerging currently acts as distributor is the cultural content. Much of that content is distributed by Emerging on a worldwide basis.

The CCC‚Äôs activities have shifted focus throughout its existence. In the 2010s the center focused on contemporary art exhibitions and interventions, under the vestige of the CCC Visual Arts Center, as well as on radical, social justice education initiatives, under the vestige of the Him Mark Lai Learning Center. The Center is located inside the Hilton San Francisco Financial District, at 750 Kearny Street, #3, San Francisco, CA, 94108. Overview The facilities of the Center, totaling 20,000 square feet (1,900 m2), include a 299-seat auditorium, a 2,935-square-foot (272.7 m2) gallery, a gallery shop, classroom, and offices. It is located between Chinatown and the Financial District. The current Executive Director is Mabel Teng, former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and former City Accessor-Recorder. Mabel Teng History = Founding and building = The city government put up city-owned land that formerly housed the Hall of Justice for sale. As a compromise, founder J.K. Choy struck a deal with the developer for a 20,000 square foot facility dedicated to community cultural activities. alt= The Chinese Culture Foundation of San Francisco incorporated on October 15, 1965. Another compromise led to the modification of the planned Portsmouth Square Pedestrian Bridge to accommodate the future activities. Holiday Inn was completed in January 1971, while the bridge was completed in August 1971. After some political tensions between CCF and the heavily Nationalist majority faction in Chinatown, work began on the Chinese Culture Center facilities on January 27, 1973. =Beginning operations= Early activities were marked by a desire to be non-controversial and non-political because of tense Taiwanese-PRC relations and factions within Chinatown. The Center began hosting workshops and classes on Mandarin language, folklore, martial arts, music, painting and calligraphy, crafts, drama, dance, and shadow play. It also held celebrations of the Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival. Docent-guided tours of Chinatown began in 1974. Some of the CCC's early art programs were coordinated with local museums, such as the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco. ='80s and '90s= 1989, CCC received a grant to implement an annual program called In Search of Roots. Each year, ten American-born Chinese youth interns who wished to trace their ancestries to the Pearl River Delta, under CCC guidance, researched their family histories, visited their ancestral villages, and contributed findings to an annual CCC exhibit. Following relaxation of US-PRC relations, CCC began sponsoring public lectures on Chinese arts and culture by scholars. After the Chinese economic reform and democracy in the Republic of China on Taiwan, the Two Chinas became less hostile, so older Chinatown organizations began to cooperate with the Chinese Culture Center in the 1990s. = Present Era = With the hire of Abby Chen as Program Director in 2008, the Chinese Culture Center began to focus solely on contemporary art, an initiative rebranded as the CCC Visual Arts Center. The Center began publishing catalogues of its exhibitions for sale and archival purposes for archives such as Asia Art Archive. CCC‚Äôs education initiative was dedicated as the Him Mark Lai Learning Center in 2013. Focusing on community-based, socially-engaged art interventions, in 2013, CCC opened 41 Ross, a pop-up art gallery space in historic Ross Alley that promotes dialogue amongst artists and local residents. 41 Ross is operated in partnership with the Chinatown Community Development Center. CCC‚Äôs public artwork, Sky Bridge, was honored as the \\"Best Public Art\\" of 2015 by KQED. In 2016, the Portsmouth Square Pedestrian Bridge was dedicated as the Rolland Lowe Bridge in honor of the Lowe family's patronage and strong support of CCC. Current arts programs = Exhibitions = In the CCC Visual Arts Center, CCC has produced over 100 quarterly, rotating gallery exhibitions of various styles, media, and modalities. These exhibitions are centered on the XianRui ÈÆÆÈä≥ Artist Excellence Series (also known as \\"Fresharp\\") curated by Abby Chen. XianRuiÈÆÆÈä≥ is an award- based solo exhibition that rewards innovative, mid-career, contemporary Chinese and Chinese-American artists. XianRuiÈÆÆÈä≥ has included: * Beili Liu‚Äôs Lure (2008): A series of installations of thousands of hand-coiled disks of red thread suspended from the ceiling, borrowing from the ancient Chinese legend of The Red Thread. * Stella Zhang‚Äôs 0 Viewpoint (2010): Sculptural, monochromatic installations and sculptures exploring femininity, sexuality, and nationality. * Zheng Chongbin‚Äôs White Ink (2011): Fifteen new and site- specific large scale abstract ink paintings and video projections, innovating traditional Chinese ink painting. * Summer Mei Ling Lee‚Äôs Into the Nearness of Distance (2014): Experimental installation exploring and transcending complications of inter- and counter-relationships. WOMENÊàëÂÄë, a traveling exhibition curated by the CCC's program director Abby Chen that examined feminist, queer, and gender-expansive arts-activism in contemporary China, opened in Shanghai in 2011, came to the CCC Visual Arts Center in 2012, and was exhibited in Miami in 2013. CCC‚Äôs other exhibitions series include Episode, which invites guest curators and artists to expand CCC‚Äôs programmatic rhetoric, as well as Present Tense, which gives platform to young, emerging artists. = Site-based art = CCC‚Äôs recent initiatives focus on community- based arts in the form of public artworks as well as arts-based interventions. Much of this site-based art is rooted in 41 Ross, CCC's pop-up, collaborative art space that opened in 2013. Notable public arts include: * Central Subway Public Art Project (2013): A collection of murals by Justin Hoover in Wentworth Alley. * Sky Bridge (2015): A temporary public artwork by Beili Liu consisting of 50,000 pieces of reflective mylar epoxied to the Lowe Pedestrian Bridge to reflect the sky. *Liminal Space (2016) A public art installation of an ocean projected in Ross Alley by Summer Mei-Ling Lee. * St. Mary‚Äôs Square (TBD): An application-based, community-juried art installation in St. Mary‚Äôs Square. Notable arts-based interventions include: * Occupy Shanghai Subway (2012): A public intervention in which feminist activists donned artworks from WOMENÊàëÂÄë and held signs in the subway to protest sexual harassment. * San Francisco Chinatown Keywords School (2013): A socially-engaged art project and relational aesthetics work by artist Xu Tan. Public space was transformed into a workshop for youth to collect, explore, and create \\"key words\\" via artistic analysis and creation. * Sunrise (2016): A space-based intervention that transforms the Rolland Lowe Pedestrian Bridge into a park with landscape design and a mosaic by Mik Gaspay. Current education and engagement programs CCC‚Äôs education initiative was dedicated as the Him Mark Lai Learning Center in 2013, serving as the hub for its tours, both Chinatown Walking Tours and Roots Excursions, as well as lectures, rebranded as Thought Leader Seminars. =Tours= Docent-led Chinatown Walking Tours are aimed towards tourists, activists, as well as school groups, locally and nationally. Current tours include: * From Dynasty to Democracy Walk: Social justice- oriented tour that reconciles Chinatown activism history beginning in the 1800s with civil rights movements at large. * Art Walk: Highlights both historical and contemporary community-based arts and culture in Chinatown. California Roots Excursions, reimagining the original program, In Search of Roots, explores Chinese American migration history. Current excursions include: * Roots Excursion to Locke: Tour of Locke, one of the few remaining Chinese communities out of hundreds that existed. * Roots Excursion to Monterey: Tour of Monterey where Chinese families landed in the 1850s to create the abalone and squid industry. =Thought Leader Seminars = CCC‚Äôs Thought Leader Seminars invite scholars, artists, and activists for public lectures that expound upon the organization's educational and artistic programs. Recent seminar leaders include Timmy Yip, Gordon H. Chang, Yu Xinqiao, and Elizabeth Sinn. =Festivals= CCC has also continued to put on festivals for citywide audiences and Chinatown residents, activating Chinatown with political and artistic consciousness by inviting local artists to intervene in local spaces. These include the Chinatown Music Festival in late summer, the Spring Festival in the spring, and Dancing on Waverly in early fall.

In July 2004 she joined Yale University as a Professor of World Religions. She also serves as the editor of the Journal of Indian Philosophy. Academic credentials After receiving a Bachelor of Arts (summa cum laude) in Far Eastern Languages from Radcliffe College, she earned her Ph.D. in Sanskrit, Indian Studies and Fine Arts from the Harvard University. She is fluent in numerous Indian languages, including Sanskrit, PrƒÅkrit, PƒÅli, Ardha Magadhi, Bengali, Hindi, Assamese, Gujarati and Oriya. In addition, she has some degree of skill in Japanese, Chinese, French and German. Professional history Professor Granoff has taught at numerous institutions, including the Austrian- American Institute, McMaster University, University of California at Berkeley, Harvard University, Sorbonne, √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales, and Yale University. Professor Granoff's work has focused on Indian mythology, cults, image worship, art, literature, poetry, and medieval Indian law codes. With her husband, Professor Koichi Shinohara, she has written, translated and edited several books, and has published more than 70 journal articles on various topics. Over the years, Phyllis Granoff has inspired and worked closely with scholars who have revolutionized the study of Indic religions, including Gregory Schopen. Anthologies Pilgrims, Patrons and Place: Localizing Sanctity in Asian Religions (2003) is a book which brings together essays by anthropologists, scholars of religion, and art historians on the subject of sacred place and sacred biography in Asia. The chapters span a broad geographical area that includes India, Nepal, Thailand, Indonesia, and China, and explore issues from the classical and medieval period to the present. They show how sacred places have a plurality of meanings for all religious communities and how in their construction, secular politics, private religious experience, and sectarian rivalry can all intersect. The contributors explore some of the most fundamental challenges that religious groups face as they expand from their homeland or confront the demands of modernity. In every case the biography of a saint or founding figure proves to be central to the formation of religious identity. Sacred place becomes a means of concretizing the ever-expanding sphere of the saint's influence. [3] Images in Asian Religions (2004) is a work which work offers a challenge to any simple understanding of the role of images by looking at aspects of the reception of image worship that have only begun to be studied, including the many hesitations that Asian religious traditions expressed about image worship. Written by eminent scholars of anthropology, art history, and religion with interests in different regions (India, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia), this volume takes a fresh look at the many ways in which images were defined and received in Asian religions. Areas addressed include the complex, fluid, and contested nature of the religious image; the reception of images within the intellectual culture of Hinduism and Buddhism; and the importance of historical and cultural context in the study of religious images. [4] Translations The Forest of Thieves and the Magic Garden: An Anthology of Medieval Jain Stories (Penguin, 1998) is a translation of numerous medieval Jain stories drawn from texts dating from the seventh to the fifteenth centuries CE, focusing on the Indic concept of renunciation. The stories translated in this book have been very carefully selected to explore numerous themes central to Jainism and medieval Indian culture. The original language for these stories is sometimes Sanskrit and on other occasions Prakrit. [5] The Journey: Stories by Kishor Charan Das (University of Michigan Press, 2000) is a collection of urban stories whose characters are mainly middle class. Kishor Charan Das is one of the more distinguished writers of the OriyƒÅ language. His stories are often about differences between realities and imagination. These are stories about human weaknesses, the fallibility of human relationships, and the strategies we adopt to cope with our failures. They are about coming to terms with unpleasant, sometimes shocking truths about ourselves and others. [6] Academic recognition Phyllis Granoff first received academic recognition for her 1978 book titled \\"Philosophy and Argument in Late VedƒÅnta: ≈örƒ´ HarshƒÅ's Kha·πá·∏çanakha·πá·∏çakhƒÅdya.\\" This book deals with the work of ≈örƒ´ HarshƒÅ, a twelfth-century Indian philosopher, who is regarded as \\"one of the most important intellectual figures to rise within the mature Sanskrit tradition.\\" [7] The Journal of the American Oriental Society reviewer of this work declared it to be \\"the first conceptually and textually responsible work dealing with ≈örƒ´ HarshƒÅ.\\" [7] In this work, Granoff is praised for providing a different perspective from that of \\"the Western and neo-Hindu readings of VedƒÅnta,\\" by showing it to be an \\"existentially earnest, logically sophisticated philosophical position.\\" [7] Professors Granoff and Shinohara also received praise for their 1992 work titled \\"Speaking of Monks: Religious Biography in India and China.\\" The reviewer of this book described Granoff and Shinohara to be \\"experienced masters of the textual sources of the hagiographical traditions with which they deal\\" and credited them for their \\"ability to show the relevance of seemingly insignificant details\\" and their \\"obvious linguistic familiarity with a variety of literary genres.\\" [8] A reviewer described Granoff's 2005 translation of Bengali literary giant Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay to be \\"one of the most satisfying works of vernacular Indian fiction to appear in English translation in years\\" and commended Granoff on her \\"masterful translation.\\" [9] Works cited # Dan, A. \\"A Review of Bones, Stones and Buddhist Monks.\\" http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew99061.htm # Schopen, G. \\"Bones, Stones and Buddhist Monks.\\" Hawaii: University of Hawaii Press, 2000 (pp. xii)https://books.google.com/books?id=rxdZ- BVNm_IC&pg;=PR12&lpg;=PR12&dq;=gregory+schopen+phyllis+granoff&source;=web&ots;=TnVzk25HF_&sig;=Lk2Y3zefAZvVtuv72-4oLmfghSQ#PPR8,M1 # University of British Columbia Press https://web.archive.org/web/20070223051854/http://www.ubcpress.ca/search/title_book.asp?BookID=3013 # University of British Columbia Press https://web.archive.org/web/20070223051903/http://www.ubcpress.ca/search/title_book.asp?BookID=3198 # Product Details & Reviews, Amazon.com https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0140437223 # Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies, University of Michigan Press http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=19321 # Alper, H. \\"Journal of the American Oriental Society\\" 103:3 (1983) # Strong, J.S. \\"Journal of Asian Studies\\" (1994) # Choudhury, C. \\"The World of Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay.\\" The Middle Stage (18-Sept-05) http://middlestage.blogspot.com/2005/09/world- of-bibhutibhushan-bandyopadhyay.html References * Phyllis Granoff's Photograph (Florida State University) * Phyllis Granoff's Faculty Curriculum Vitae (Yale University) * Phyllis Granoff's Professional Home Page (Yale University) Category:Radcliffe College alumni Category:Yale University faculty Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty Category:University of Paris faculty Category:Harvard University faculty Category:American Indologists ","title":"Phyllis Granoff"},{"id":"9825860","text":"Live in Hokkaido 1995.12.4 Bootleg is an X Japan live album released on January 21, 1998.

He was the 1975 Hermann Trophy winner as the outstanding collegiate soccer player of the year. He then had an extensive professional career including time in the North American Soccer League and the American Soccer League II and III. High school and college Born in Yugoslavia, Ralbovsky moved to the United States in 1970. He played soccer at DeWitt Clinton High School in New York City. His excellent play led to his receiving the Public School Athletic League Iron Horse Pegasus Award in 1971‚Äì1972 for soccer.Iron Horse / Pegasus Award Winners 1971‚Äì1999 After graduating from high school, he attended Brown University, where he starred on the school's men's soccer team. He played both defender and defensive midfielder. During his four seasons with the Bears (1972‚Äì1975), Brown dominated the Ivy League. Harvard had been the team to beat in years past, but beginning in 1972, Brown reeled off five straight Ivy League championships. In 1973 and 1975, the team made it to the NCAA Final Four, losing both times in the semi-finals. In 1973, they lost to St. Louis University and in 1975 to the University of San Francisco. Ralbovsky garnered numerous individual awards during his time as at Brown. He was selected as All Ivy League in 1974 and 1975. In 1975, he was named as a first team All- American, ironically enough as a forward;1975 All Americans the NCAA Tournament Defensive MVP and the Hermann Trophy recipient as the year's outstanding collegiate soccer player. He was inducted into the Brown University Athletic Hall of Fame.Brown University Hall of Fame Professional When Ralbovsky finished his four years at Brown, both the North American Soccer League and the de facto second division American Soccer League (ASL) vied for his services. The Los Angeles Skyhawks of the ASL managed to lure him to the lower league with a higher compensation package then the NASL's Los Angeles Aztecs offered him. Both the Skyhawks of the ASL and the Aztecs of the NASL had selected Ralbovsky with the number one pick in the leagues‚Äô respective college drafts. Ralbovsky had an immediate impact on the Skyhawks as they ran away with the 1976 ALS championship, defeating the New York Apollo 2-1 in the title game. It was in that game when, with the score tied at 1, Ralbovsky was tripped from behind in the penalty area while on a breakaway ‚Äì the resulting penalty kick was converted to give the Skyhawks the title. Ralbovsky was named joint Rookie of the Year with John Roeslein of the New Jersey Americans.The Year in American Soccer ‚Äì 1976 While Ralbovsky's play with the Skyhawks brought him to the attention of the national team, he didn't stick around to play a second season in Los Angeles. Instead, he jumped leagues to NASL where he joined the Chicago Sting for the 1977 season. Once again he played only a single season with his team before moving again, this time to the Colorado Caribous, also of the NASL, for the 1978 season. He moved yet again after only a single season, this time his last move, to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, where he rejoined his former Skyhawk manager, Ron Newman. He played with the Strikers for three years, 1979‚Äì1981, as a left back. In 1979, he played only 11 games. However, in 1980 and 1981, he became an integral part of the Strikers back line, playing 28 and 22 games per season. In 1980, the Strikers made it to the NASL championship game before losing to the New York Cosmos by a score of 3-0. In 1981, the Strikers again went deep in the playoffs before losing again to the Cosmos, this time in the semifinal game. After the 1981 season, Ralbovsky returned to the American Soccer League, this time for good. In 1983, he played for the league champion Jacksonville Tea Men which had jumped leagues from the NASL after the 1982 season. However, this was the last year for the American Soccer League as it folded at the end of the season and the Tea Men played in the United Soccer League in 1984.

One of the country's first prominent painters, he was known for his costumbrist sensibility and preference for everyday themes. Early life Pueyrred√≥n was the only son of Juan Mart√≠n de Pueyrred√≥n, then the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata, and Mar√≠a Calixta Tellechea y Caviedes, an aristocrat. He completed his primary education at the upper-class Colegio de la Independencia. In 1835 his family relocated to Europe, where he completed his education. He spent the school year in Paris and summers in C√°diz, where his father owned a business importing Argentine leather. Six years later, as relations between France and Argentina suffered owing to the refusal of Juan Manuel de Rosas to grant commercial privileges to ships of French origin‚Äîa matter which would not be resolved until the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado a few years later‚Äîthe Pueyrred√≥ns left Europe for R√≠o de Janeiro. The city's liberal atmosphere encouraged Pueyrred√≥n's artistic vocation. On his return to Paris three years later he received his parents' permission to study engineering. Return to Buenos Aires El ba√±o (1865) In 1849, because the elder Pueyrred√≥n was seriously ill, the entire family returned to Buenos Aires. The general died the following year at the family estate in San Isidro. Although the young Prilidiano, already an engineer, was a peculiar figure by the standards of the porte√±o aristocracy, and although rumours abounded about his immorality, he managed to gain favour with the aristocracy by painting their portraits. His subjects included Manuelita, the daughter of Rosas, whom he painted in 1851, shortly before the caudillo's defeat at Caseros. He was the first painter in Buenos Aires to paint nudes, of which two, La siesta and El ba√±o, survive to this day and are housed in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes. In the middle of that year, however, he fell out with his cousin and neighbour Magdalena Costa, whom he had courted, and this drove him to leave the city and return temporarily to C√°diz. There, an affair with a local girl led to the birth of his only daughter. Artistic maturity Detail of Un alto en el campo Lavanderas en el bajo de Belgrano Pueyrred√≥n returned to Buenos Aires for the last time in 1854, and applied his engineering and architectural skills to the extensive public works upon which the city's port, separated from the Argentine Confederation, had embarked. He worked on the restoration and enlargement of various monuments, among them the chapel of Recoleta, the Pyramid of the Plaza de Mayo, and the Casa Rosada. As an urban planner, he designed the Plaza de la Victoria, a park on what was then the Julio Avenue, and the bridge in the neighborhood of Barracas. He also designed the mansion built by Miguel de Azcu√©naga in Olivos which later became the official residence of the President of Argentina. The 1850s and 1860s were Pueyrred√≥n's most prolific period as a painter. 233 works survive from this period, more than half of them commissioned portraits. During this period he became one of the first painters to explore the figure of the gaucho, whom he depicted in the Romantic style he had discovered while living in Europe. Many of his most famous works depict life in the wilds of the Pampas and on the banks of the R√≠o de la Plata: Un alto en el campo (1861), Capataz y pe√≥n de campo (1864), Lavanderas del Bajo Belgrano (1865), and Recorriendo la estancia (1865). Pueyrred√≥n died on November 3, 1870, aged 47, at his family's estate in San Isidro. He was largely forgotten until the 1930s, when Argentine critics recognized his contributions to the country's artistic heritage. Particularly admired is his portrait of his father.

The word \\"bora\\" also refers to the site on which the initiation is performed. At such a site, boys, having reached puberty, achieve the status of men. The initiation ceremony differs from Aboriginal culture to culture, but often, at a physical level, involved scarification, circumcision, subincision and, in some regions, also the removal of a tooth. During the rites, the youths who were to be initiated were taught traditional sacred songs, the secrets of the tribe's religious visions, dances, and traditional lore. Many different clans would assemble to participate in an initiation ceremony. Women and children were not permitted to be present at the sacred bora ground where these rituals were undertaken. Bora terminology The word Bora was originally taken from the Gamilaraay language spoken by the Kamilaroi people who lived in the region north of the Hunter Valley in New South Wales to southern Queensland. It was then adopted broadly to describe similar ritual sites and the ceremonies associated with them performed throughout Eastern Australia. Many other terms exist across Australia to denote similar initiatory rites on a ceremonial ground, such as burbung (Wiradjuri), and kuringal (Yuin). The specific word is said to come from the belt worn by initiated men. Bora grounds and mythology The appearance of the site varies among cultures, but it is often associated with stone arrangements, rock engravings, or other art works. In the bora rites of southeastern Australia, two circles were drawn, connected by a pathway, a schema which appears to replicate a sky Bora, or the configuration of a series of positions in the Milky Way. Typically, bora ground comprised a larger circle with a diameter of between 20‚Äì30 metres, and a smaller ring around 10‚Äì15 metres in diameter. The former was a more public space while the latter was sacred, and restricted to male participants who were either the instructing male elders or the initiands. In south-east Australia, the Bora is often associated with the creator-spirit Baiame. In the Sydney region, large earth mounds were made, shaped as long bands or simple circles. Sometimes the boys would have to pass along a path marked on the ground representing the transition from childhood to manhood, and this path might be marked by a stone arrangement or by spirit footprints (mundowa), cut into the rock. In other areas of south-east Australia, a Bora site might consist of two circles of stones, and the boys would start the ceremony in the larger, public, one, and end it in the other, smaller, one, to which only initiated men are admitted. Matthews (1897) gives an excellent eye-witness account of a Bora ceremony, and explains the common use of the two circles. One very fine example of a two ring bora ceremonial site used to exist in Alberton till it was destroyed, and made way for a pineapple plantation in the late 1950s. The smaller southern ring contained a dolmen-like structure. The rings are joined by a sacred walkway. While most are confined to south-east Queensland and eastern New South Wales, five earth rings have been recorded near the Victorian town of Sunbury, although Aboriginal use has not been documented. Bora rings in the form of circles of individually placed stones are evident in Werrikimbe National Park in northern New South Wales.

In his 32 years as a collegiate head coach, Blair has only suffered one losing season, and has reached postseason play 28 times, including 23 NCAA Tournament appearances and 2 Final Four appearances in 1998 and 2011. He led the Aggies to the NCAA national championship in 2011. He is listed in the top 35 of the all-time winningest active NCAA Division 1 women's basketball coaches, and is one of the few coaches to guide three different schools to national rankings and NCAA Tournament berths. Blair was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013. Early life Gary Blair is the son of Lee, a plaster foreman, and Jean, a housewife. He was raised in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Dallas. He grew up playing baseball, and as a 128-pound center fielder at Bryan Adams High School, he received all-city honors in 1963. Following his high school graduation in 1963, he enrolled at Texas Tech University, where he failed out of architecture, and moved to California to become a restaurant manager. He got a U.S. Army draft notice in 1969, and decided to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps, completing a four-year tour of duty. He was stationed in Okinawa during his duty. After his tour, he lived in the Los Angeles area, running a restaurant in Costa Mesa and Culver City. At age 27, he used his G.I. Bill to earn a bachelor's degree in health and physical education with a minor in journalism from Texas Tech. He also played a year of baseball for the Red Raiders‚Äîhe was a defensive center fielder with self-described poor hitting skills. He earned his master's degree in education from the school in 1974. When head women's basketball coach Marsha Sharp retired from Texas Tech in 2006, Blair got calls from his friends to take over the position. Blair stated, \\"It wasn‚Äôt the right fit or the right time. Timing is everything in coaching.\\" Early coaching career After his graduation from Texas Tech, Blair hoped to find a high school baseball coaching job in Lubbock, but he was offered the physical education coach gig at South Oak Cliff High School in Dallas, a predominantly African American school. South Oak Cliff had just started its women's basketball program, and Blair became the team's first coach in 1973. He was initially the boy's P.E. teacher, while waiting for an offer to coach the baseball team, but when asked to coach the girls' team, he accepted. He also started the boys and girls golf team, and served as its first coach as well. He made $7,000 annually coaching all of these sports. In his seven seasons at South Oak Cliff, he set a state record with five consecutive state tournament appearances and a 239-18 record. His teams won three state Class 4A championships, in 1977, 1978, and 1980, and finished as the runner-up in 1979 by only two points. For his efforts, Blair was inducted into the Texas High School Basketball Hall of Fame. At South Oak Cliff, Blair coached Debra and Kim Rodman, Dennis Rodman's sisters. Blair used to play ping pong with Dennis. After winning the first state championship, he was offered the head baseball job he had been waiting for, but he turned it down to remain coaching the women's teams. In October 1980, Blair was offered an assistant coaching job at Louisiana Tech by then-head coach Sonja Hogg. At the time of the offer, Blair was making an annual salary of $22,000. The Louisiana Tech position paid $22,500 and also provided a six-year-old brown station wagon. Blair initially rejected the offer, but upon his wife's encouragement, he accepted it. He would coach under Leon Barmore, who replaced Hogg. During his five seasons there, Louisiana Tech reached the Final Four in the NCAA Tournament four times, winning two national championships. Head coaching career =Stephen F. Austin (1985‚Äì1993)= Blair's first head coaching experience at the collegiate level came at Stephen F. Austin University in Nacogdoches, Texas. In his eight years with the school, he compiled a 210-43 record, including 25 wins in just his second season as a head coach. His teams won seven straight conference championships, and appeared in the NCAA Tournament six times. During his last six seasons, his teams were consistently ranked in the final AP Top 25 polls. The team's success was noticed by their fans, who increased home attendance enough to allow the school to rank in the top 12 of NCAA Division 1 attendance leaders. It was during his time at SFA that Blair met his future assistant coach Vic Schaefer, who was coaching the Sam Houston State Bearkats (one of SFA's main rivals) at the time. Blair was inducted into the Ladyjack Hall of Fame during halftime of the Ladyjacks game against the Aggies on December 2, 2008. =Arkansas (1993‚Äì2003)= As the head coach of the women's basketball team at Arkansas, Blair compiled a 198-120 record. During his first season, the Lady Razorbacks won 15 of their 29 games, their first winning season in several years. The following year his team, which consisted of 9 freshmen and sophomores, won 23 games and reached the second round of the NCAA tournament. In the summer of 1996, while his Arkansas team was in their offseason, Blair spent several months in Taiwan as the assistant coach of the U.S. Jones Cup team, which won the gold medal and became the first U.S. team to be undefeated at the Jones Cup tournament. Every one of the players he helped coach during that tournament later went on to play in the WNBA. Blair made history with his 1997‚Äì1998 team. The team, unranked in the national polls, received a number 9 seed for the NCAA Tournament and reached the NCAA Final Four. His teams reached the semifinals in the SEC tournament in both 2001 and 2002. In his final season with the Lady Razorbacks, the team finished the season ranked 24th nationally and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament. =Texas A&M; (2003‚Äìpresent)= Gary Blair (and Jordan Jones) at the Maggie Dixon Classic in Madison Square Garden December 22, 2013 Blair arrived at Texas A&M; in 2003, taking over the Big 12 Conference's worst team, which had not had a winning season in seven years. In his first season with Texas A&M;, Blair worked very hard to attract fans to the women's basketball games, and by the end of the season attendance had increased 71 percent over the previous year, the best increase in the Big 12 Conference. For the first time in his career, however, one of Blair's team suffered a losing season. The following year the Aggies improved, earning a postseason invitation for the first time since 1996. In his third season with the Aggies, Blair guided his team to their first Associated Press Top 25 ranking in ten years. The team won 23 games (losing 9), the third-most victories in school history and a tie for the most victories in conference play ever (11 wins, 5 losses in conference). The team finished third in the Big 12, and reached the semifinals in the Big 12 Women's Championship Tournament. With a Number 6 seed to the NCAA Tournament (A&M;'s first such invitation since 1996), Blair became only the fourth coach in NCAA history to take three different schools to the NCAA Tournament, although this became his only appearance where his team lost in the first round. Following their successful season, Blair was named the Women's Basketball News Service National Coach of the Year. Overall, in his first three years as the head coach of the Aggies, A&M; home attendance increased 156%, with a school-record 11,088 fans watching the team play Baylor University. In the 2006‚Äì2007 season, Blair's Aggies again scored over 20 wins and reached the NCAA Tournament, this time as the fourth seed, and advanced to the second round of the tournament. This marked the first time in Aggie history that the women's basketball team had earned consecutive NCAA tournament berths. On February 20, 2008, Blair posted his 500th career win as a head coach at Reed Arena against the Iowa State Cyclones. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, Blair led his squad to a school-first NCAA Elite Eight appearance and a 29‚Äì8 overall record. The team also won the 2008 Big 12 conference tournament title. In the NCAA tournament, the team lost to eventual national champion Tennessee. After the season, the Texas A&M; Board of Regents approved a one-year contract extension through 2012, and a $150,000 salary raise to $800,000 annually. On March 29, 2011, Gary Blair led the program to its first ever Final Four appearance by defeating top-seeded Baylor 58-46. On April 3, 2011, the Aggies defeated top-seeded Stanford 63‚Äì62 to advance to the national title game. Two days later, the Aggies defeated Notre Dame 76-70 in the championship game to win the tournament for the first time in school history. Blair, 65, also became the oldest women's coach to win a national championship. Gary Blair was also selected as a 2012 namesake for Texas A&M;'s extended orientation camp, \\"Fish Camp\\". USA Basketball Gary Blair was named the assistant coach of the 1996 R. William Jones Cup Team. The competition was held in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team was dominant, winning their games by an average off 33 points per game. The USA team won their opening seven games, behind the scoring leadership of Sheri Sam, who averaged 13 points per game. In the eighth game, they played undefeated Slovakia, in a game that would determine the gold medal. The USA fell behind; Slovakia had a 22‚Äì15 lead. The USA came back, but was still behind at halftime. The game was tied at 45 all, when the USA hit several free throws to take a lead they would not give up. The USA team won the game and the championship 72‚Äì62. In the final game, the USA beat South Korea to finish the competition with a perfect 9‚Äì3 record.

A common practice is to take a short phrase from a speech and loop it repeatedly over background music, usually generic electronic music. Humor and satire are the main devices of an auditorial, often encouraging the general public to laugh at and criticize the figure in question. History The term auditorial was coined in 2007 by Nate Miller, 2006-2007 editor in chief of The State Hornet, the student newspaper of Sacramento State. The State Hornet was the first news organization to use an auditorial as an official journalistic opinion piece. The auditorial criticized Athletics Director Terry Wanless after he downplayed a possible incident of hazing, speculating that pictures of freshmen soccer players depicting chiefing might be showing \\"a masquerade party.\\" Chiefing, also sometimes known as marking, is a common form of hazing in which \\"Victims are made to wear visible symbols, drawings or text (obscenities, instructions for abuse) on (under)clothing or on bare skin.\\" The auditorial received mixed responses, with some commenting that it detracted from the legitimacy of The State Hornet. The article upon which the auditorial was based has since been recognized by a variety of media organizations, including second place Breaking News Story by the California College Media Association in 2008. The February 14 issue of The State Hornet, which printed the first story covering the controversy, won Best of Show honorable mention at the 2007 ACP National College Newspaper Convention. The February 14, February 21 and February 28 issues of The State Hornet were recognized in 2007 as one of the top six newspapers in the General Excellence 4-Year University Division by the CNPA. Importance Auditorials represent a new medium for news organizations to express their opinions. Previously limited to what could be printed on the editorial page of a newspaper (such as editorials, columns, letters to the editor and editorial cartoons) or what could be said over the radio or television, journalists now have an entirely new medium‚Äîone which uses short clips from audio recordings of prominent public figures‚Äîto express their opinion. Similar works The concept of auditorials, some might argue, was made popular by spoofs on Howard Dean's infamous \\"I have a scream\\" speechhttps://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/2004-01-22-dean- usat_x.htm during the 2004 United States Presidential campaign. These remixes, however, cannot be considered true auditorials, as they were not created as an official piece of work by a credible newspaper or other journalistic outlet.

The transmitter for the station is located west of Oxford, Iowa. The station currently has a Classic rock format. The station is currently owned by Townsquare Media. History In 1971, a group of University of Iowa students formed a company known as Communicators Inc. of Iowa that aimed \\"to put together a radio station with a major market sound in what was basically a small-to-medium market.\\" At the time, FM radio stations in Iowa were primarily used for beautiful music formats or repeater signals for co-owned AM stations while popular music was played on AM stations. By 1974, Communicators Inc. of Iowa had been renamed KRNA, Inc., and the company was granted FCC approval to begin broadcasting. KRNA began broadcasting at 93.5 FM on October 4, 1974. (KRNA later moved to 93.9 FM in 1979 before moving to its present 94.1 FM at 9 a.m. on October 14, 1991.) By January 1975, Arbitron telephone surveys showed that nearly half of local radio listeners were tuned into KRNA. As part of its \\"major market sound\\", KRNA pre-recorded its commercial announcements during a time when most commercials were read live on the air, and it also broadcast 24 hours a day while other radio stations signed off during the overnight hours for equipment maintenance.Stein, 111. In 1994, KRNA purchased the former KQCR radio (102.9 FM) in Cedar Rapids to create the area's first radio duopoly. After reformatting KQCR as country music station KXMX, owners Rob Norton and Eliot Keller agreed to sell KRNA and KXMX to Capstar Broadcasting in 1998. While the KRNA sale was successful, Capstar terminated the agreement to buy KXMX. (Norton and Keller kept KXMX, renaming it KZIA and changing the station's format to contemporary hits.) AMFM, Inc., acquired Capstar in 1999, and Clear Channel Communications acquired AMFM in 2000; however, KRNA was sold to Cumulus Media that year since Clear Channel already owned a group of stations in eastern Iowa. Today, KRNA broadcasts from the APAC building in downtown Cedar Rapids with Cumulus-owned stations KHAK, KDAT, and KRQN. In 2004, KRNA's format shifted from classic rock to active rock, adopting the nickname \\"Real Rock 94.1\\". That year, former KFMW morning DJs Lou Waters and Scott Steele became the station's morning-drive disc jockeys. Lou and Scott were replaced by Davenport-based DJs Greg Dwyer and Bill Michaels in January 2007. Dwyer and Michaels joined KRNA as the result of a non-compete clause that prevented them from working at any station in the Quad Cities market for six months after their contract with Clear Channel Communications expired at the end of 2006. Dwyer and Michaels, who had previously worked with WXLP and KCQQ radio in the Quad Cities, rejoined Cumulus-owned WXLP on July 13, 2007, but continued to simulcast their show on KRNA until late 2008. Clear Channel sued Dwyer and Michaels in February 2007, claiming that KRNA was audible in the Quad Cities area and the duo was actively promoting the show in the Quad Cities. On March 1, 2007, a Scott County judge ruled that Dwyer and Michaels did not violate the clause since Arbitron did not consider the Quad Cities part of KRNA's market area. For many years, KRNA was known for distributing free posters of the Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team at live remote broadcasts. This tradition began in the late 1970s, and while the posters are now sold by the University of Iowa athletic department, they continue to be printed under the sponsorship of KZIA.Stein, 54. On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would acquire 53 Cumulus stations, including KRNA, for $238 million. The deal was part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global are both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013. On September 5, 2014, KRNA adjusted its playlist to include more songs from the alternative rock genre.Iowa's Alternative is on the Air! At 5 p.m. on August 12, 2016, KRNA adjusted its playlist to consist of songs from the classic rock genre.94.1 KRNA Brings Classic Rock That Rocks Back to The Corridor References External links *KRNA website *Dwyer and Michaels Website * RNA Category:Mass media in Cedar Rapids, Iowa Category:Iowa City, Iowa Category:Townsquare Media radio stations Category:Classic rock radio stations in the United States ","title":"KRNA"},{"id":"9826201","text":"Grover Cleveland Brewer (1884‚Äì1956) was among the most famous 20th-century leaders in the Churches of Christ. He was said to be \\"among the giants of the brotherhood\\" (Woods 246). \\"G. C.\\" Brewer was named for U.S. President Grover Cleveland. Brewer is generally known by his initials. He was born in Giles County, Tennessee; he died in Searcy, Arkansas, on June 9, 1956. He was an author, preacher, and teacher, serving on the faculty of Lipscomb University (then known as David Lipscomb College). His persuasive rhetoric and passionate oratory have been noted along with his uncanny ability to define mainstream biblical doctrine in the mid-20th Century. (His brother, Dr. Charles R. Brewer, was also a notable preacher and a teacher at David Lipscomb University, where to this day a bell tower stands in his honor.) G. C. Brewer was no stranger to controversy, challenging Catholicism and Communism directly and debating frequently; yet he also demonstrated a willingness to change his views, especially those regarding the doctrine of grace.  Grace  According to Leonard Allen (163-64), John Mark Hicks , and Richard Hughes (186-87), Brewer's championing of K. C. Moser's book The Way of Salvation (1932) signaled a paradigm shift in the way that people in the Churches of Christ were thinking about grace. Brewer wrote that \\"Our salvation does not depend upon our perfect adherence to the requirements of law. . . . By making our salvation dependent upon our own perfection, we make void the grace of God\\" (qtd. in Allen 164). Especially in the 1930s, Foy E. Wallace and Brewer engaged in a longstanding feud over this and other controversial issues, \\"contending for the faith\\" at the Abilene Christian College Bible Lectures and in the pages of the Gospel Advocate and other periodicals. Wallace took Moser's book for \\"denominational error on the gospel plan of salvation\\" (qtd. in Hicks) whereas Brewer sought to de-emphasize legalism and human works and to promote a theory of God-given \\"unmerited favor\\" (Hughes 186).  Non- Institutional Churches  One facet of their disagreement, more financial than theological, eventually lead to a schism. Wallace and Brewer debated about the propriety of churches funding colleges. Non-institutional Churches of Christ remember Brewer mainly for his unwavering call for congregational support of colleges associated with the Churches of Christ, a position that non- institutional churches reject. See The churches of Christ (non-institutional) for more about the debate over this issue. Historian Richard Hughes has characterized Wallace's \\"fighting style\\" (176-77, 182-85) in a way that could well describe Brewer's rhetorical aggression.  Politics and Pacifism  Despite Brewer's clearly stated patriotism, he was also a product of the teachings of James A. Harding and David Lipscomb. At their Nashville Bible School (Lipscomb University), where Brewer enrolled in 1904 after a year at Johnson Bible College,Robert E. Hooper, A Distinct People: Churches of Christ in the Twentieth Century (West Monroe, LA: Howard Publishing, 1994), p. 141, ; Thomas H. Olbricht, \\"Brewer, Grover Cleveland (1884-1956),\\" Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement, ed. Douglas A. Foster, Paul M. Blowers, Anthony L. Dunnavant, & D. Newell Williams (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 2004), pp. 97-98, . Brewer learned to downplay politics, a lesson he held dear his entire life. Hughes has noted \\"that shortly before his [Brewer's] death in 1956 he recalled, 'I have never even voted in my life'\\" (186). Lipscomb had been a lifelong pacifist, even during the Civil War, yet Brewer believed that the threat of Communism was simply too great to ignore. Brewer therefore balanced his disengagement from the ways of the world with his active concerns for the Christian identity of American politics. This balance characterized many of the Churches of Christ in the mid-20th Century. (For the trajectory of Brewer's thoughts, from pacifism during World War I to anti-communism and American nationalism in the 1930s, see the book The churches of Christ by Richard Thomas Hughes, especially pages 123-125.) Brewer was also a vociferous anti-feminist, attributing much of America's 20th-century moral decline to the emancipation of women. (Chapter 3 of his autobiography is dedicated to the topic.) He opined that women in positions of authority must 'constantly battle against the tendency to become masculine, coarse, and brazen.' He blamed liberated fallen women for irresistibly tempting good Christian boys into sexual sin. He also believed that women were the spiritual inferiors of men. Sinful men can be reformed, but, 'When woman goes wrong... there is little hope of ever reaching her...she can never be worth anything in his world...it were better for her to go immediately to the electric chair.' Brewer was also a conspiracy theorist, claiming that 'The United States passed completely under the control of Roman Catholics, Jews and Communists under the reign of Franklin D. Roosevelt.' Weakly defending against his suspicions that he might be a bigot, Brewer wrote, 'Not all Jews are un-American, not all Catholics are disloyal to our ideals, but all Communists are un-American and anti-American. The Jews are internationalists, the Catholics are subject to a foreign power, and the Catholic system is contrary to American ideals.' (Autobiography, p. 26 )  Books by G. C.

Owned by Bustos Media, it broadcasts a rhythmic oldies format. Its studios are co-located with television station KGUN-TV in Tucson, and its transmitter site is located in the city's northwest side. History KTGV goes back to the mid-1980s, when KTTZ went on the air at 103.1, displacing K276AL which was a translator for KUAT-FM, that moved to 89.5 before the station went on the air. Once on the air it took an eclectic view of rock music, which lasted until August 31, 1987. The next day KHYT moved from 1330 to 103.1 and switched to a classic rock format. That didn't last and in May 1988 they adopted the calls KAWV and the imaging for Los Angeles' KTWV including the slogan 'The Wave'. Soon that was gone and it went through several other formats and calls. Eventually a frequency swap involving moving the 103.1 frequency to Florence Arizona placed them on the current 106.3 frequency and they got a power increase as well. As to the 101.7 translator, that was either eliminated or displaced when KCMT first went on the air at 101.9. KGMG got the 104.9 translator sometime around or after that time. The current format is an outgrowth of the previous format, urban AC, and they took a more classic soul/AC approach following the change of format from rhythmic oldies to 'La Preciosa' at what is now 97.1 KTZR. On March 17, 2011 translator K285DL 104.9 FM stopped simulcasting KGMG and began simulcasting sports-formatted KFFN 1490 AM Tucson, AZ.

Bradford, 606 P.2d 554 (1979) is a Supreme Court of Oklahoma case. Facts Mrs. Scott, the plaintiff, sought treatment from Dr. Bradford. She was diagnosed with several uterine fibroids. She signed a routine consent to surgery form prior to the hysterectomy. Afterward she was experiencing problems with incontinence, and she visited another doctor. She was found to have a fistula between her bladder and vagina which allowed urine to leak from her bladder into her vagina. She underwent three additional surgeries to correct her problem. She claimed the fistula was caused by the doctor's negligence during surgery. The doctor responded that this was a known complication of the surgery. Mrs. Scott said she was never informed of this risk. Reasoning The duty to disclose is the first element. Then proof that patient would have chosen no treatment or a different course of treatment had the alternatives and risks been made known, thus establishing a causation. If the patient would have elected to proceed the element of causation is missing, and so too negligence. A causal connection between the patient‚Äôs injury and the doctor‚Äôs breach of a duty to disclose exists only when the disclosure of material risks would have resulted in a decision against it. The final element is that of an injury. The risk must have actually materialized, AND pl must have been injured as a result of submitting to the treatment.

The speeches were performed on 6 January 1610 in conjunction with the ceremony known as Prince Henry's Barriers. Barriers \\"Barriers\\" was a stylized martial combat, conducted on foot with swords and pikes; it was something like a joust without horses. Though ceremonial in nature, the practice had some inherent risk (as jousting did), and the sixteen-year-old Prince Henry had to persuade his reluctant father to allow his participation. The ceremonial challenge that initiated the barriers occurred on 31 December 1609; Prince Henry then kept an \\"open table\\" at St. James's Palace, which cost ¬£100 per day. The Prince was supported by a team of six nobles and gentlemen: Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox; Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel; Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton; James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle; Sir Robert Gordon, and Sir Thomas Somerset. The seven met fifty-eight challengers during the Barriers; \\"each bout consisted of two pushes with the pike and twelve sword-strokes, and the young prince gave or received that night thirty- two pushes and about 360 strokes.\\"E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 393. Show Barriers ceremonies were often lushly decorated and costumed. As with Jonson's other masques for the Court, the sets and costumes for Prince Henry's Barriers were designed by Inigo Jones. Jonson's text for the speeches that preceded the combat involve figures of Arthurian legend. The Lady of the Lake inaugurates the work, at the site of the tomb of Merlin the Magician. Arthur participates in the form of a star above the scene. (Arthur represented James, who never took part directly in masques and entertainments.) Merlin rises from his tomb; he and the Lady condemn the contemporary decay of chivalry, but predict its restoration under the new reign of the House of Stuart. (Jones's two sets supported this theme; one was a ruined House of Chivalry, and the other, St. George's Portico.John Peacock, The Stage Designs of Inigo Jones: The European Context, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1995; p. 69.) The Lady and Merlin call forth \\"Meliadus, lord of the isles,\\" (Henry). Merlin summarizes British history; then a personified spirit of Chivalry emerges, after which the barriers combat took place. Jonson had to tread lightly between the King's well-known pacifism and the Prince's more martial frame of mind. He had the Lady of the Lake present the Prince with a shield, rather than the more usual and typical sword,Alison V.

Rosenthal and J. Warrack, Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera (OUP, London 1974 printing). He had a repertoire of 80 operas and was the brother of the orchestral conductor Cleofonte Campanini.  Early days  Born in Parma, Campanini studied at the Parma Conservatory before making his operatic debut as Manrico in Il trovatore, in 1869, in Odessa. Further study with Francesco Lamperti in Milan followed, and in 1871 he returned to the stage in Bologna, scoring his first major success in the Italian premiere of Lohengrin.Rosenthal and Warrack 1974.  London beginnings  Early in his 1872 Drury Lane season J. H. Mapleson, the London opera impresario, recruited Campanini from Rome, where he was in competition with the agents of Frederick Gye, the Covent Garden theatre impresario.J.H. Mapleson, The Mapleson Memoirs (Belford, Clarke & co., Chicago 1888), I, 153-154. On May 4, 1872 the tenor made his London debut as Gennaro in Lucrezia Borgia, with Th√©r√®se Tietjens in the title role, Zelia Trebelli as Orsini and Agnesi as Duke Alfonso, under the baton of Michael Costa.H. Klein, Thirty Years of Musical Life in London (Century Co, New York 1903), 20. Klein states that Alfonso was sung by Jean-Baptiste Faure. He was an immediate success, being hailed by some as the tenor successor to Mario or Antonio Giuglini on what the critic Herman Klein (who attended) called a night of triumphs.Klein 1903, 20. It was at Drury Lane that he first sang with lyric soprano Christine Nilsson, to whom he became a celebrated stage partner. An agent from London attempted to lure him away at a rate of a thousand pounds sterling a month. He remained with Mapleson (at one-fifth of that sum) but became difficult to manage. However, he was to remain a stalwart and mainstay of Mapleson's company for the next ten years. In autumn 1872, he visited Dublin with the company (which included Maria Marimon, Ilma de Murska, Sofia Scalchi and Signor Foli [Allan Foley]), and toured the main cities of England and Scotland. During the spring of 1873, they undertook a back-up tour of British provincial towns.Mapleson 1888, I, 153-154.  First American tour  Campanini made his first American appearances at the Academy of Music, New York, in 1873. Here, in addition to Christine Nilsson and Giuseppe Del Puente (baritone) (regular Mapleson company singers), he was with Annie Louise Cary (with whom he often afterwards sang) in performances of Les Huguenots.G. Kobb√©, The Complete Opera Book (Putnam, London 1935 printing), 503. On 26 November 1873 he was Rhadames in Max Strakosch's production of Aida, with Mlle Torriani (Aida), Cary (Amneris) and Victor Maurel (Amonasro), according to Gustav Kobb√© (who saw it) a performance of unsurpassed brilliancy.Kobb√© 1935, 440. He was still in New York on 23 March 1874 when he, Nilsson, Cary and Del Puente participated in the Italian-language production of Lohengrin at the Academy.Kobb√© 1935, 117.  London again  During his London career, Campanini became especially well known in the roles of Manrico (Il trovatore), Fernando (I puritani), and Edgardo (Lucia di Lammermoor). At his return for the 1874 season in London, in June he joined a Drury Lane cast in Michael Balfe's posthumous opera Il Talismano (Italian production) with Tietjens and Nilsson, and with the young Giovanni De Reschi in a baritone role (who later became the famous tenor Jean de Reszke).Klein 1903, 58. Les Huguenots and La favorita were among other productions of the season. In the 1875 season came the first London Lohengrin (with Emma Albani and Ernesto Nicolini at Covent Garden), soon followed by Mapleson's production at Her Majesty's Theatre in which Campanini, Tietjens, Nilsson and Antonio Galassi (baritone) led a starry cast under the direction of Michael Costa.Mapleson 1888, I, 166; Klein 1903, 44-45. The 1878 season was distinguished by the first London production of Bizet's opera Carmen, on June 22. Mapleson had seen it the previous winter at the Brussels Monnaie and decided to transfer it to Her Majesty's. He obtained the American soprano Minnie Hauk for Carmen, who had become famous in the role in Paris; Alwina Valleria portrayed Mica√´la, and Del Puente Escamillo, to Campanini's Don Jos√©‚Äî under Michael Costa's baton. Despite the misgivings of the artists in rehearsal, it was an extremely effective cast among which Campanini himself was conspicuous for his singing and acting, reputedly with superb dramatic power, and it was greeted with a triumphant reception. Klein and the famous singing teacher Manuel Garcia were in the audience.Mapleson 1888, I, 197-198; Klein 1903, 84-90.  English summers, American winters  In the winter of 1878-79 Mapleson undertook a major opera tour of the United States, in which Campanini was his principal tenor. The company also included such well known singers as Etelka Gerster, Minnie Hauk, Trebelli, Valleria, Galassi and Del Puente. Luigi Arditi was the conductor. It visited Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, St Louis, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cincinnati and New York. Campanini sang opposite Gerster in Il talismano and La traviata, and with Marie Roze in La favorita, and a very wide range of operas was presented including Faust, Il flauto magico, Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, Il barbiere di Siviglia, Ruy Blas, Robert le Diable and Der Freisch√ºtz, in addition to much of the repertoire already mentioned. The series culminated with a benefit concert in New York for flood victims at Szegedin in Hungary (Gerster's birthplace).Mapleson, I, 199, 214-215. Some surprises were, however, held in store for New York in the following year. The London 1879 season had added Minnie Hauk, and Clara Louise Kellogg to the female company (still led by Nilsson, Trebelli and Gerster), and Campanini was supported by the tenors Giuseppe Fancelli, Frapolli and Brignoli.Mapleson 1888, I, 232. Fancelli was infuriated by Campanini assuming the title 'Primo Tenore Assoluto'.Mapleson 1888, II, 286. The October 1879 tour season, in which Maria Marimon was among the party, visited New York, and went on to Philadelphia, Chicago, St Louis, Detroit, Cleveland and elsewhere.Mapleson 1888, I, 234. Campanini conquered New York. On 23 October at the Academy they gave the American premiere of Carmen, with Minnie Hauk, Clarice Sinico (Micaela), Ernesto del Puente, and Campanini in his now famous role of Don Jos√©.Kobb√© 1935, 586. On December 3 he appeared as Elvino in La sonnambula, with Marimon, del Puente and Mme Lablache, and on December 12 was Corentino in Meyerbeer's Dinorah, again with Marimon.Kobb√© 1935, 531; Mapleson 1888, I, 232-234. Later in the season, when Mdlle Marimon was unable to complete a performance of Dinorah at Philadelphia, Campanini (in the audience) and Annie Louise Cary stepped in to sing the last acts of Il trovatore instead, and Campanini's rendition of \\"Di quella pira\\" brought the house down and saved the box- office.Mapleson 1888, I, 235-236. The London Her Majesty's season of 1880, with Nilsson and Gerster, saw presentations of Faust, La sonnambula, Carmen and Aida under Michael Costa, and also a Lohengrin conducted for Mapleson by Hans Richter.Mapleson 1888, I, 237, 242. But the major new event of the season, in July, was Boito's Mefistofele, with Nilsson, Trebelli and Nannetti, and with Campanini as Faust. Costa conducted it 'in his old, resolute and vigilant manner', and the production 'lent a special distinction to the season.'Klein 1903, 153. This then went on tour to New York (under Arditi, as usual), where Campanini led the cast for the American premiere at the Academy of Music with Annie Louise Cary, Alwina Valleria and Franco Novara.Kobb√© 1935, 475. The same venue saw Mapleson's production of a revised form of Les v√™pres siciliennes headed by Campanini and Cary with del Puente and Galassi in support.Kobb√© 1935, 436-437. Campanini performed, too, in La favorita. Mapleson had by now recruited Luigi Ravelli to relieve the burden on Campanini, who had become his only principal tenor. During the tour, which this time also took in Pittsburgh and Indianapolis, Mapleson inaugurated 'Sunday evening concerts', the first half of which was usually a performance of Rossini's Stabat Mater given by Valleria, Cary, Campanini, Galassi and Novara.Mapleson 1888, I, 242-253. The London season of 1881 resumed the run of Mefistofele, and the October tour in New York saw Camapanini perform in Lohengrin (with Minnie Hauk, Anna de Belocci, Galessi and Novara) and in Carmen (Hauk, Valleria and del Puente, the original line-up.)Mapleson 1888, I, 261. In February 1882, the company was at the second great Cincinnati Opera Festival, where Campanini appeared again as Don Jos√© (opposite Hauk, del Puente and Louise Dotti). The company also staged Les Huguenots, Faust, Fidelio, Magic Flute, William Tell and Lohengrin. Meanwhile, the company also rehearsed, and then presented, Meyerbeer's L'Africaine, in which Campanini played Vasco da Gama opposite Hauk and Galassi; and in the spring 1882 Ernani, Don Giovanni and Les Huguenots were produced at the New York Academy of Music.Mapleson 1888, I, 271.  Collapse of Mapleson's company  On his return to England, Campanini found that the 1882 season was being disrupted by negotiations over the Royal Italian Opera Company, Covent Garden, Ltd‚Äîformed to seek the lease of the new Metropolitan Opera House, New York, which was then being built. Campanini was among the large team taken to New York that October by Mapleson, with Commander Herbert Gye as his treasurer, on its behalf. If the plan worked, the Academy (to which Mapleson was still tied by contract) would be closed and a monopoly achieved, in which he would have a share. Despite immense difficulties a successful tour was achieved, but in the process all Mapleson's resources were carved up between the American impresario, Henry Eugene Abbey, who actually obtained the lease, and the Royal Opera Company, which repudiated all its agreements with Mapleson, leaving him with a heavy liability. The best singers of his company, including Nilsson, Marcella Sembrich, Scalchi, Trebelli and Campanini, and all his orchestral and choral resources, were recruited by Abbey. Campanini took the occasion to spend a season in Italy, where his younger brother Cleofonte Campanini was launching a significant career as an operatic conductor. In 1883, at Parma, Campanini sang in a series of performances conducted by his brother, so helping to establish him as conductor of the first rank.A. Eaglefield-Hull, A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians (Dent, London 1924). When he returned to America in the autumn it was to the completion of the Metropolitan Opera House, and there he sang in the performance of Faust on the opening night, 22 October 1883, with Christine Nilsson as Marguerite, Sofia Scalchi, Mme Lablache, Franco Novara and Ernesto del Puente.Kobb√© 1935, 562; Mapleson 1888, II, 11. On December 5, 1883 he sang the other Faust (Bo√Øto's) in Mefistofele, with Christine Nilsson, Zelia Trebelli and Mdlle Mirabella filling out the cast.  American career, vocal characteristics and tenor rivals  After 1883, Campanini lived primarily in New York City, serving as the Metropolitan's leading tenor. He developed increasingly a second career as a manager of opera (as, in later times, did the tenors Giovanni Zenatello and Edward Johnson). On April 16, 1888, a company under Campanini's management presented the American premiere of Verdi's Otello at the New York Academy of Music,Kobb√© 1935, 458. with Francesco Marconi,For Marconi, see M. Scott, The Record of Singing I (Duckworth, London 1977), 121-123. Eva Tetrazzini, Antonio Galassi and Sofia Scalchi: later in the run, Campanini himself took over from Francesco Marconi in the role of Otello. Campanini's brother Cleofonte was brought in to conduct, and he married the Eva Tetrazzini, the famed Luisa's older sister. Campanini remained a member of the Metropolitan company from 1891 to 1894. Campanini died at the Villa Vigatto, near Parma, in 1896. He was among the most popular, hardworking and versatile Italian tenors active in the United States before the advent of the great Enrico Caruso in the early 1900s. Apparently, while in the USA, he recorded his voice on a Gianni Bettini cylinder which now appears to be lost.Scott 1977, 2, note. During the peak of his career, Campanini's main tenor rivals among his Italian and Italianate contemporaries were Roberto Stagno, Juli√°n Gayarre, Angelo Masini, Francesco Tamagno, Fernando Valero and Francesco Marconi. Of these only Tamagno, Valero and Marconi have left gramophone records of their art. We do know, however, from contemporary descriptions that Campanini's voice was robust in tone. It extended up to a strong high C from the chest prior to an irreversible deterioration which began when Campanini was aged only in his forties. It also developed a wide vibrato which reduced its appeal to English-speaking critics. He shared this latter trait (or, in the opinion of British and American opera- goers, technical and stylistic flaw) with a number of other leading Mediterranean tenors of his era, including Gayarre, Stagno, Valero and, from a slightly younger generation, Fernando De Lucia.

The grains, actually three-dimensional in shape, have a thin lenticular shape. This microstructure is advantageous over other microstructures because of its chaotic ordering, which increases toughness.. Acicular ferrite is formed in the interior of the original austenitic grains by direct nucleation on the inclusions, resulting in randomly oriented short ferrite needles with a 'basket weave' appearance. Acicular ferrite is also characterised by high angle boundaries between the ferrite grains. This further reduces the chance of cleavage, because these boundaries impede crack propagation. In C-Mn steel weld metals, it is reported that nucleation of various ferrite morphologies is aided by non-metallic inclusion; in particular oxygen-rich inclusions of a certain type and size are associated with the intragranular nucleation of acicular ferrite, as observed, for example, by,.Abson D J, Dolby R E and Hart P H M H, ‚ÄúThe role of nonmetallic inclusions in ferrite nucleation in carbon steel weld metals‚Äù, In: Trends in Steels and Consumables for Welding.

AIME, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, H I Aaronson, D E Laughlin, R F Sekerka and M C Wayman, Editors, 1982, 463-468 Acicular ferrite is a fine Widmanst√§tten constituent, which is nucleated by an optimum intragranular dispersion of oxide/sulfide/silicate particles. The interlocking nature of acicular ferrite, together with its fine grain size (0.5 to 5 um with aspect ratio from 3:1 to 10:1), provides maximum resistance to crack propagation by cleavage. Composition control of weld metal is often performed to maximise the volume fraction of acicular ferrite due to the toughness it imparts. During continuous cooling, higher alloy contents or faster cooling generally delay transformation, which will then take place at lower temperatures, below the bainite start temperature, and lead to higher hardness. The efficacy of inclusions as nucleation sites in modern low alloy steel weld metals is such that fine-scale intragranular bainite can nucleate on them, both by continuous cooling and by isothermal transformation below the bainite start temperature. Some confusion has arisen in the literature, as this fine-scale intragranular bainite, which can resemble acicular ferrite in appearance in the optical microscope, has been called acicular ferrite by some researchers. See, for example.Yang J. R and Bhadeshia, H K D H, ‚ÄúThermodynamics of the acicular ferrite transformation in weld metals‚Äù, In Advances in Welding Science and Technology, Proc. Int.

He sang at many famous theatres, including New York's Metropolitan Opera, Milan's La Scala and London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Biography A native of Cesena, Romagna, Bonci started out as an apprentice shoemaker. He secured a music scholarship to the Rossini Conservatory in Pesaro, working for five years with Carlo Pedrotti (the teacher of the heroic tenor Francesco Tamagno) and then Felice Coen. He also had private singing lessons in Paris with the retired baritone Enrico Delle Sedie. Columbia Phonograph advertisement. Alessandro Bonci made his debut in Parma in 1896, singing the role of Fenton in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff at the Teatro Regio. Before the end of his first season he was engaged to sing at La Scala, Milan, where he debuted in Vincenzo Bellini's I Puritani. Appearances elsewhere in Europe followed, including at London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. He first sang at Covent Garden in 1900 and he would return there in 1903 and 1907-08. On December 3, 1906, Bonci made his American debut with the Manhattan Opera Company in New York City; again the opera was I Puritani. He stayed two seasons with the company, becoming a popular competitor to Enrico Caruso, who was the rival Metropolitan Opera's major drawcard. Bonci himself joined the Metropolitan Opera in 1908 and, in 1914, the Chicago Opera. He also made a transcontinental tour of America in 1910-11, giving song recitals. Bonci served in the Italian army during World War I, returning to America to tour for three seasons after the end of the conflict. He appeared again at the Metropolitan Opera, and sang in Chicago during the 1920-21 season. In 1922 and 1923 he served as the principal tenor of the Teatro Costanzi in Rome and conducted master classes across the United States the following year. After 1925, Bonci entered into partial retirement, devoting himself primarily to teaching in Milan. He still sang occasionally in public as late as 1935. He died in Viserba, Rimini, in 1940, at the age of 70. Recordings Bonci's artistry was captured on disc by the Fonotipia, Edison and Columbia companies. His first recordings were made in 1905 and his last in 1926, with a handful produced between these dates (in 1913). He is heard to best advantage in operatic arias by Bellini, Rossini, Donizetti and Gluck, but he was also renowned in Europe and the United States for his Rodolfo in Puccini's La boheme, his Riccardo in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera and his Duke of Mantua in Verdi's Rigoletto. Voice Bonci was a demure man and his voice was not overly large. It was sweet-toned, stylish and supple, with excellent high notes and an easy high C. He sang with what at the time would have been considered a standard vibrato, though later generations (until our own) preferred a slower one.

Rodulf (; died 21 June 866) was the archbishop of Bourges from 840 until his death. He is remembered as a skillful diplomat and a proponent of ecclesiastical reform. As a saint, his feast has been celebrated on 21 June. Aquitainian nobleman and monk Rodulf's family was prominent in the region of Angoumois and he himself possessed lands in the Limousin. He was named after his father, the count of Turenne (died 844), and he had four brothers and two sisters as well as an unnamed sibling. He entered the monastery of Solignac as a novice in 823. During the conflict between King Pippin II of Aquitaine and King Charles of West Francia over the inheritance of the Aquitanian kingdom, Rodulf maintained good relations with both claimants, although it is probable that his father fought in the war and is possible that Rodulf himself did as well. Contemporary documents describe him as a \\"faithful follower\\" (fidelis) of King Pippin. In late 840 Rodulf was elected as archbishop of Bourges, Since Pippin led an expedition north against Charles' forces in Poitou in September, it generally thought that he was the driving force behind the election of Rodulf and that he successfully extended his authority into the Berri (the region around Bourges), which was as far north as it would ever go. One of Pippin's two surviving royal charters is a confirmation to the new archbishop. Yet if the appointment of Rodulf was political on the one hand, the capitulation (capitula) which he signed upon his election \\"shows that [he] was in the vanguard of the Carolingian reform movement.\\" Shortly after becoming archbishop, Rodulf bought a large piece of land from a certain Boso for 1,500 solidi. West Frankish diplomat By early May 844, Rodulf had recognised Charles as king in Aquitaine. In that month he visited Charles while the latter was besieging Toulouse and received a charter from him at Charles's headquarters in the monastery of Saint-Sernin. Rodulf attended the council of Ver in December that year. According to the Translatio sancti Germani, Rodulf and Bishop Ebroin of Poitiers played the leading r√¥les in the negotiations to reconcile Charles and Pippin in the winter of 844‚Äì45. Rodulf hosted a conference at the monastery of Fleury in June 845, where Pippin swore fealty to Charles and Charles gave Pippin lordship over most of Aquitaine (the regions of Poitou, Saintonge and Aunis excepted). Later that same month, Rodulf attended the great synod at Meaux with archbishops Wenilo of Sens and Hincmar of Reims. As a reward for his work, Charles granted Rodulf control over Fleury's resources in October 846. In August or September 849, after Pippin had rebelled against Charles, Rodulf, \\"with the greatest enthusiasm\\", hosted a royal assembly before the king moved south to besiege Toulouse a second time. According to the Annales Fontanellenses, Charles then spent Christmas in Bourges and stayed into January 850. Rodulf may have served as guardian (bajulus) to Charles's son, Charles the Child, when the latter was made king of Aquitaine in 855. Late in 860, Hincmar of Reims wrote a letter to Rodulf and Archbishop Frothar of Bordeaux‚Äîwho may have been a kinsman of Rodulf's‚Äîoutlining the difficulties of Count Stephen, son of Count Hugh of Tours, who was trying to repudiate his wife, the daughter of Count Raymond I of Toulouse. Rodulf and Frothar were successful in negotiating a settlement. The scale of the disorders may be gauged by two charters of Rodulf's from 859 and 860, in which he laments \\"the presence of evil men\\" (infestorum malorum hominum) in his diocese, an indication of violence and civil strife. In 860 Rodulf drew up a will and had it confirmed by Raymond of Toulouse. Church reformer With Bishop Stodilo of Limoges, Rodulf helped found the monastery of Beaulieu. His family provided the land for the foundation, and he himiself consecrated the new community under the Benedictine rule in 860. He granted the monks the right of free election of their abbot, and pronounced excommunication on any governing authority who molested them in the future. He even procured royal protection (mundeburdium) for them. Rodulf's brother Gottfried, the count of Turenne, along with Raymond of Toulouse and Aldo, abbot of Saint Martial's, were witnesses to this act of consecration. In 859, Stodilo granted a church to Rodulf and Abbot Garnulf of Beaulieu as a precarium in return for an annual rent of seven solidi. Rodulf also helped found the convent at Cahors where his sister Immena was installed as the first abbess. The earliest reference to the archbishop of Bourges as primate of Aquitaine dates from the episcopate of Rodulf. In 864, when Archbishop Sigebod of Narbonne complained to Pope Nicholas I that Rodulf had called some clergy of Narbonne before him \\"as if by patriarchal right\\" (quasi jure patriarchatus), the pope confirmed the right of clergy to appeal to Bourges if all avenues in Narbonne had been exhausted and of the suffragans of Narbonne to appeal to Bourges \\"as if to their patriarch\\" (quasi ad patriarchum suum). In his acts Rodulf sometimes titled himself \\"primate\\" (primas) and \\"bishop of the primatial see\\" (primae sedis episcopus). Rofuld died at Bourges on 21 June 866 and was buried in the basilica of Saint Ursinus. He was succeeded by a cleric from the royal palace of Charles the Bald named Wulfad. Into the twelfth century, the community of Beaulieu commemorated Rodulf as \\"our master of holy memory\\". A rather standard hagiography of Rodulf, the Vita sancti Rodulfi, survives.

Environmental gerontology  Research in environmental gerontology indicates the importance of the physical and social environment of housing and the neighborhood (public space), as well as its implications for aging in place.  Preference  Most adults would prefer to age in place‚Äîthat is, remain in their home of choice as long as possible. In fact, 90 percent of adults over the age of 65 report that they would prefer to stay in their current residence as they age. One-third of American households are home to one or more residents 60 years of age or older. Technology can be an enabler for aging in place‚Äîthere are four categories of technology that acts as an enabler‚ÄîCommunication and Engagement, Health and Wellness, Learning and Contribution, and Safety and Security.See Market Overview for Technology for Aging in Place 2013 Caregiving technologies help those who care for older adults provide that care in the most effective way‚Äîand include new technologies for smart phones and tablets, as well as websites‚Äîsuch as Caring.com or AARP.org/Caregiving.  Home modifications  There exist many risks for injury to older adults in the common household, therefore impacting upon their capability to successfully age in place. Among the greatest threats to an ability to age in place is falling. According to the CDC, falls are the leading cause of injurious death among older adults. Therefore, engagement in fall prevention is crucial to one's ability to age in place. Common features in an everyday household, such as a lack of support in the shower or bathroom, inadequate railings on the stairs, loose throw rugs, and obstructed pathways are all possible dangers to an older person. However, simple and low-cost modifications to an older person's home can greatly decrease the risk of falling, as well as decreasing the risk of other forms of injury. Consequently, this increases the likelihood that one can age in place. Some examples of home modifications include: increased lighting, accessible switches at both ends of the stairs, additional railings, grab bars, nonskid flooring, a hand-held flexible shower head, walk-in bathtubs, and the removal of throw rugs and clutter. In most cases, home modifications can be simple and cost-effective, while simultaneously offering substantial benefits to the individual. Other modifications to the home ‚Äì especially those that require retrofitting ‚Äì are a little more costly due to increased complexity of installation. These can include: ramps for accessible entry and exit, walk-in shower, sliding shelves, stairlifts, or even home elevators. Many homes are built or retrofitted with the Universal design model in mind, which makes everything in the home accessible to all people with or without functional limitations. Resources in the community Naturally occurring retirement communities, also known as NORCS, are another source of support for older adults wishing to age in place. A NORC, though not built specifically for a certain age demographic, occurs where a congregation of residents 60 and older live cooperatively. Some offer recreational activities, preventative health and social services for the community. This model can be supported by local, state, and federal dollars as well as community businesses, neighborhood associations and private foundations. Technological changes In some cases, the caregivers of people who are aging in place seek to persuade them to adopt new technology, which may include learning new skills and changing their daily routine to incorporate the technology. , there is research about how people aging in place try to use new technology when persuaded, but not much research about the extent to which they continue to use it after trying it for some time. Factors which contribute to the decision to try to technology are the anticipated benefits of the technology, the difficulty using it, the extent to which the user feels that harm will come from not using it, the availability of alternatives, support from others in their social circle, and their own personal attitudes and disposition. Biological reasons Many elders have difficulties with everyday functioning that require modifications to the houses or apartments they live in. There are several reasons why these changes happen: *Motor functioning: In a 2002 study by Min Soo Kang, it was reported that of the elder population in America, 18% will have a disability. This calculates to 51 million Americans who have difficulties in functioning every day. 32% over age 65 will have difficulty walking, which may require use of walkers, wheelchairs and canes. To make life easier for the elder, some modifications that can aid them are wider entrances, grab rails, elevator chairs on stairs, etc. *Fine motor functioning: Elders may have difficulty using their fingers, which can be problematic. As a result, modifications to handles, bathroom fixtures, etc. can aid with this problem. *Cognitive functioning: It was reported in Kochera (2002) that 1 out of 5 people over the age of 55 will have a mental health disorder. Due to the deterioration, the five senses and cognitive capability decrease and cause slower responses. As a result, fire hazards may not be noticed, which can be very important when setting up fire alarms, exits, etc. Examples Aging in place can be further defined by: # Aging in place without urgent needs: This group includes individuals who want to stay in their current home, are not experiencing immediate health/mobility issues, and prefer aging in place. # Aging in place with progressive condition-based needs: This group is made up of those with chronic or progressive conditions that will require special modifications for aging in place. These individuals are usually aware of their needs but meeting them is not necessarily urgent. Many have chronic conditions such as diabetes and lung/heart disease that challenge them. # Aging in place with traumatic change needs: This group includes those who experienced an abrupt or immediate change that demands adjustments in the living environment for aging in place such as home modifications or universal design. Careers in the field By working with a person's regular physician and other doctors, an Occupational Therapist (OT) can suggest changes to be made to a person's home in order to uniquely compensate for that particular patient's capabilities and disabilities. By making an appointment and meeting with an Occupational Therapist, a patient is getting a one-on-one based session where the therapist is focused solely on that patient's limitations and is making strategies in order to modify the patient's home, making it safer and letting them keep their independence. OT's will work with contractors and occasionally local groups and volunteers to make home modifications ranging from small changes like better lighting to more extreme changes such as chair lifts instead of stairs. An OT will typically try to make low-cost adjustments in the initial stages, but once again this is based on each individual. OT's also provide services to older adults in community based scenarios focusing in health promotion.  Initiatives worldwide  = In Canada = In Ontario, Canada, aging in place is known as aging at home, and has received considerable financial support from the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care. = In United States = According to the United States Census, 46 million people age 65+ lived in the United States in 2014 and this same segment of the population will grow to 74 million in 2030. Websites and organizations have sprung up all across the nation, in individual communities, states and nationwide to help people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. Aging in Place is an initiative of Partners for Livable Communities and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. It was developed to help America's communities prepare for the aging of their population and to become places that are good to grow up, live in and grow old. They have been working directly with nine laboratory communities to assist them in advancing policies, programs and services to promote Aging in Place. A similar network is the Elder Villages.The Village: A Growing Option for Aging in Place, Fact Sheet 177, AARP Public Policy Institute, 2010. Smart homes are also another development to help promote aging in place by integrating a range of monitoring and supportive devices. These homes have technology for physiological monitoring, functional monitoring for emergency detection and response, safety monitoring and assistance, security monitoring and assistance, social interaction monitoring and assistance and cognitive and sensory assistance. Georgia Institute of Technology has developed a smart house. This house would help to address issues older adults face when living alone, such as physical and mental decline as well as awareness for family members. The house includes technology such as pendants which understand commands in the form of hand gestures. It could open and lock doors, close blinds, turn on lights, and more. There is also an in-home monitoring system that can inform family members about an older relative's daily activities, health status, and potential problems. This would allow older adults to remain in their own home while still maintaining their independence without their families having to worry about their well being. This is not the only smart house that has popped up. The University of Florida has created one as well. It has smart refrigerators and pantries which can detect food consumption and expired products. Their smart laundry machines can coordinate with the smart closet to notify the resident when it is time to do laundry as well as aid in sorting the laundry. Every room is specially designed with these and many more smart features to aid their living situation. Similar technology has been done at the Washington State University, University of Texas, University of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Missouri, as well as in Osaka, Japan. In December 2011, AARP Policy Institute and the National Conference of State Legislatures released a report entitled, \\"Aging in Place: A State Survey of Livability Policies and Practices\\" to foster aging in place by giving state legislators examples of how laws, policies and programs can support this goal. In addition to such governmental initiatives, livability can be optimized through the incorporation of universal design principles, telecare and other assistive technologies. Assistive technologies include communications, health and wellness monitoring, home safety and security. Semico Research published a report in July 2013 claiming the health and wellness monitoring market for Aging in Place will reach $30 billion by 2017. The Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) model was created in the early 1970s in order to meet the chronic care needs of older people through their community. As an assistance program, one must be at least 55 years of age, certified by their state to need nursing home care, are able to live safely in the community at the time of enrollment, and live in a PACE service area. The goal of the PACE program is to care for the chronic care needs of older individuals while providing them with the ability to live independently, or age in place in their homes, for as long as possible. In order to make independent living possible for this population, the PACE program provides services, such as physical therapy, respite care, prescription drugs, social services, nutritional counseling, and much more. Since 2011, PACE has 82 operational programs in 29 states, and is continuing to expand today. = In Middle Eastern and Asian countries = For many countries in the Middle and Far East, it is part of the cultural beliefs for older adults to age in place. Many children believe it to be their duty to care for their parents as they age and therefore will move in with their parents when their assistance is needed. In many Middle Eastern countries, nursing homes are just recently coming into existence due to cultural and generational shifts towards Western values.

The organization has chapters throughout the United States and Canada, making it an international organization. As of fall 2019 there were 230 active TKE chapters and colonies. History =Founding= The five founders of Tau Kappa Epsilon. Clockwise from top left: James Carson McNutt, Owen Ison Truitt, Clarence Arthur Mayer, Joseph Lorenzo Settles, Charles Roy Atkinson On January 10, 1899, Charles Roy Atkinson, Clarence Arthur Mayer, James Carson McNutt, Joseph Lorenzo Settles, and Owen Ison Truitt met at 504 East Locust Street in Bloomington, Illinois to draw up the first constitution for a new fraternity at Illinois Wesleyan University. The purpose of the new organization was to be an \\"aid to college men in mental, moral and social development\\". The founders sought to be a different organization than the other fraternities at the time by establishing a fraternity where membership would be based on personal worth and character rather than wealth, rank, or honor. Mental development would be emphasized by the study of classic literature at weekly meetings, and thus the new fraternity became known as the Knights of Classic Lore. The first public announcement of the Knights of Classic Lore appeared in the February 1, 1899 issue of the Argus, which is the student publication of Illinois Wesleyan University. During formation, the Knights of Classic Lore were trying to get the Illinois Epsilon chapter of Phi Delta Theta restored. Prominent Phi Delt alumnus Richard Henry Little became a persistent sponsor for the Knights to petition Phi Delta Theta for a charter. The Knights first petitioned Phi Delta Theta at its 1902 convention in New York, but efforts were unsuccessful. After renting rooms at several locations beginning in the spring of 1899, the Knights of Classic Lore finally acquired its first fraternity house, known as The Wilder Mansion, in September 1902. Simultaneously with the acquisition of the new house, the Knights also adopted the name Tau Kappa Epsilon. The change in name was expected to create a better impression in future petitions to Phi Delta Theta. The second petition was presented at the Indianapolis convention of 1904, but it was withdrawn in an effort to gain unanimous support of all chapters in Phi Delta Theta's Zeta Province, which included Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. If this support was achieved, then the charter would be granted to the group without any action from the convention. The Knights of Classic Lore gained the support of all Phi Delta Theta groups in the province, except for Wisconsin Alpha, Illinois Beta, and Missouri Alpha. The Knights in turn unsuccessfully presented the petition at the 1906 convention in Washington, D.C. During the continuing struggle for acceptance from Phi Delta Theta, TKE continued to grow stronger in its own existence. In late 1907, TKE was preparing to petition Phi Delta Theta once again at the 1908 convention when an event took place that would forever change the course of history for the fraternity. At the annual initiation banquet on October 19, 1907, speeches were made that both advocated and questioned the continued petitioning of Phi Delta Theta. At the banquet, Wallace G. McCauley delivered a blistering speech known as \\"Opportunity Out of Defeat\\". The powerful address called for an abandonment of the petitioning initiative and a new campaign to make TKE into a national fraternity itself. While there was some opposition at the time, the movement ultimately took hold, and by 1908, TKE was well on its way to becoming a national fraternity in its own right. The speech was published in the first issue of The Teke in January 1908, and by November of that year, work was beginning on a new constitution. At the chapter meeting held on Monday, February 15, 1909, the new constitution became official. The first Conclave of the Grand Chapter of the new national fraternity of Tau Kappa Epsilon convened on February 17, 1909. =Expansion= In 1909, TKE approached the Chi Rho Sigma Fraternity at Millikin University. There were no national fraternities at Millikin at this time, and TKE had just established its intentions to become a national fraternity. Representatives from TKE presented their case, and after thorough consideration, Chi Rho Sigma voted to accept TKE's offer. On April 17, 1909, Chi Rho Sigma was installed as the Beta Chapter of TKE. In November 1911, the Beta Rho Delta Fraternity was founded at the University of Illinois. ŒíŒ°Œî petitioned Tau Kappa Epsilon in January 1912, and they were installed as the Gamma Chapter of TKE on February 3, 1912. Following the installation of the Gamma Chapter, The Teke magazine noted that the triangle was completed. The geographic location of TKE's first three chapters form a perfect equilateral triangle. The equilateral triangle was at that time, and continues to be, the primary symbol of Tau Kappa Epsilon. The national fraternity Sigma Mu Sigma merged with TKE in March 1935. The merger resulted in the new Alpha-Pi Chapter of TKE at George Washington University and additional members for the Gamma Chapter at the University of Illinois and the Alpha-Zeta Chapter at Purdue University. Prior to 1939, TKE chapters were installed after local fraternities petitioned TKE for approval. In 1939, a colonization process was established to promote expansion and to ensure that potential chapters met all necessary requirements prior to installation. The first two TKE colonies were the Eta Colony at the University of Kansas and the Chi Beta Colony at the University of Missouri.Leland, Leland F. (1949). The Golden Book of Tau Kappa Epsilon. \\"Paragraphic History of TKE\\". pp. 15‚Äì16, 81. Tau Kappa Epsilon. Tau Kappa Epsilon expanded for the first time into the Deep South region of the United States in 1946. This expansion was made possible when Alpha Lambda Tau, a small predominantly Southern national fraternity, announced its dissolution. Five of Alpha Lambda Tau's eight active chapters affiliated with TKE, resulting in new TKE chapters at the University of Maryland, North Carolina State University, Auburn University, Louisiana Polytechnic Institute, and Tri- State College. =Presidential recognition= On January 20, 1981, Tau Kappa Epsilon member Ronald Reagan was sworn in as the 40th President of the United States. Reagan joined TKE at the Iota Chapter at Eureka College in 1929. Through his time as President of the United States, Reagan remained actively involved in Tau Kappa Epsilon. In 1983, President Reagan created the Ronald Reagan Leadership Award to recognize selected student members of TKE that have demonstrated superior academic and leadership accomplishments. In March 1984, President Reagan sponsored a TKE alumni luncheon at the White House. Approximately 60 members of TKE were invited to the White House luncheon. At the luncheon, Reagan was awarded TKE's Order of the Golden Eagle and the Gold Medal of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) recognizing his lifelong efforts to support and promote college fraternities. Reagan was the first Teke and first U.S. President to receive the Gold Medal of the NIC. During the Spring Quarter of 1985 at the Alpha-Omega Chapter (UCLA), Frater Reagan was hosted to an informal reception by the Chapter's active members. There was no pre-screening of the house or its members by the Secret Service. Photos were taken to commemorate the event and the meeting was both up- building to the Chapter and to Frater Reagan. Coincidentally and as of June 2010, the brand-new UCLA Medical Center was named in his honor (Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center), a leading teaching and research hospital, and is a stone's throw from the Chapter house. In October 1984, President Reagan attended lunch at the TKE house at the Ohio State University. The Ohio State Chapter hosted President Reagan for lunch following a rally in which he was speaking at Ohio State. In June 1988, President Reagan hosted a special TKE ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House in which he presented the Ronald Reagan Leadership Award/Scholarship to TKE member Alan Friel. During the ceremony at the White House, President Reagan was presented with TKE's Order of the Silver Maple Leaf by TKE Grand Prytanis Bruce Melchert. Symbols and traditions =Apollo= The mythological ideal or patron of Tau Kappa Epsilon is Apollo, an important and complex Olympian deity in Greek and Roman mythology. Apollo is the Greek god of music and culture, of light and truth, the ideals toward which the organization strives for in their development of manhood. =Badge= TKE membership badge The official membership badge, made of gold and adorned with three white pearls, is by far the most important item of TKE insignia in general use. This badge may be worn only by initiated members. Jeweled badges, crown set with pearls, diamonds, rubies or emeralds, according to choice, may be worn by alumni members. Frequently the standard membership badge is used as a token of engagement. Miniature badges are also available for mothers, sisters, wives, chapter sweethearts or for engagement purposes. The TKE 'badge of gold,' unique in its design and distinctiveness, has never been changed since its adoption. =Red carnation= The red carnation is the flower of the fraternity. From this flower the color for the coat-of-arms, flag, and other symbols are derived. Red carnations are also worn at TKE banquets. The Red Carnation Ball is a dance that many chapters celebrate, and is named after the flower. =Coat-of-arms= The coat-of-arms may be used only by official members of the Fraternity on stationery, jewelry, and other personal effects. Modified slightly several times during the early years of Tau Kappa Epsilon, the present Coat-of-Arms, adopted in 1926, was designed by Dr. Carlton B. Pierce and Ms. Emily Butterfield. =Flag= TKE flag properly displayed horizontally and vertically The present design of the TKE flag, as adopted at the 1961 Conclave, features five voided triangles, in cherry red, on a gray bend surmounting a cherry field. Because it is patterned after the shield of the fraternity Coat-of-Arms, the flag is readily associated with Tau Kappa Epsilon. Individual chapters may also purchase and use pennants and wall banners of various designs. These usually employ the name or Greek letters of the fraternity and chapter, and may incorporate the basic TKE insignia. TKE insignia may be purchased only from the Offices of the Grand Chapter or a merchant licensed by the fraternity headquarters. =The Horseshoe= In April 1921, members of the Fraternity at The Ohio State University made their way to the Conclave in Madison, Wisconsin. At the conclusion of the vote granting their charter as the Omicron Chapter, one of the members pulled from the pocket of his pants a rusty horseshoe which the fraters had picked up along the way. Believing that the horseshoe had granted the chapter good luck, the tradition began to pass the horseshoe down to each chapter. The original horseshoe was lost during World War II at the Alpha-Chi Chapter (University of Louisville), but it was replaced with a new horseshoe to continue the tradition. In mid-1995, the original horseshoe was discovered by Past Grand Prytanis Rodney Williams among some artifacts belonging to the Alpha-Chi Chapter, which had been held for years by a charter member of the chapter. At the 49th Biennial Conclave, the original TKE horseshoe from the Omicron Chapter was displayed, and the story behind its loss explained. The horseshoe, now an adopted symbol, is traditionally displayed on a plaque given to new chapters at their founding. =The Sweetheart Song= The tradition of singing a Sweetheart Song to a fraternity's sweetheart is one shared by most fraternities. TKE is rare in that it has three different Sweetheart Songs (Sweetheart of T.K.E., Iota Sweetheart Song, and the Old Sweetheart Song). The Old Sweetheart Song was started at the Alpha-Xi Chapter (Drake University) in Des Moines, Iowa. International officers =Current officers= The following table lists the current Grand Council officers and members. The Collegiate Advisory Committee (CAC) and its chairman are active undergraduate members appointed by the TKE CEO and approved by several past Grand Prytani (Grand Presidents) to act as advisers to the Grand Council with the chairman serving on the Grand Council. {class=wikitable + style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  2019‚Äì2021 Grand Council !

In the video, which was revealed by the organization to have been filmed off-campus and not in the frat house, a male student is seen using a belt to mock-whip another male student while saying \\"pick my cotton bitch\\", to which the other male student replies \\"I'm not black\\" as two other students watch. While the student continues mock whipping him, the person filming the incident states that he (the student holding the belt) was \\"not saying the right words\\", to which the student says \\"pick my cotton nigger\\", as the others laugh. The four students were later expelled from the organization after its suspension. The Oregon State University chapter was suspended following an investigation on several reported hazing incidents. While the fraternity house was left vacant, the Corvallis police arrested two people found in the house on charges of first degree burglary, theft of services, second degree criminal mischief and unlawful possession of methamphetamine. The Sonoma State University chapter was banned from campus for five years following a hazing investigation.https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/9237949-181/sonoma-state- university-frat-banned The California Polytechnic State University chapter was banned from campus after a hazing investigation revealed pledges were forced to drink alcohol and do push ups.https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article229029219.html =2018= A member of the Indiana University chapter was arrested for selling illegal drugs in the fraternity house and off- campus.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCS3Av8hFLY The University of Nevada- Reno chapter was suspended for one year following information of its membership songs that promote violence toward women and other fraternity men on campus. The Ohio State University chapter was suspended for three years after a thorough investigation found the chapter guilty of hazing, endangering behavior, and improper use of alcohol. =2017= The Florida International University chapter was suspended for two years after a thorough investigation found the chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon had violated the University‚Äôs student code of conduct, following the release of screenshots depicting ‚Äúinappropriate content‚Äù in the group‚Äôs TKE private chat, where the fraternity‚Äôs group chat revealed photos of nude women, which had been shared without their consent, and offensive statements including Holocaust memes, jokes about rape and pedophilia and conversations about drug sales. The fraternity also got in trouble for hosting a tailgate party where a minor was served alcohol. As a result Florida International University enacted a month-long suspension of all fraternities and sororities on campus, while the administration reformed the policies concerning Greek Life. =2016= The Towson University chapter was suspended after WBAL News Radio reported that a student was \\"forced to eat cat food and a liquid he was told was vinegar and pickle juice by members of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity\\" and that \\"the student started vomiting blood hours later and was taken to a nearby hospital later that day\\". The Florida State University chapter was suspended for hazing and misconduct violations. The pledges were forced to participate in a hazing activity called \\"Old South\\" where pledges acted like slaves in blackface while serving drinks to members. Also the pledges were twice blindfolded and dropped off hours away from campus without their wallets and cellphones and then told to find their way back to campus. The University of Maryland chapter was kicked off campus due to the distribution of a video showing disturbing hazing rituals. =2015= The Northwest Missouri State University chapter had a member arrested and charged with first degree rape of a female student at the fraternity house on campus. The chapter was placed on suspension for the incident. The California State University, Northridge chapter was kicked off campus until July 2018 due to hazing and sexual misconduct. The Quinnipiac University chapter was kicked off campus due to \\"serious\\" allegations of hazing. =2014= The Arizona State University chapter was expelled by the university after photos surfaced of a racially themed \\"MLK Black Party\\" on Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday weekend, although it later surfaced that the event was not planned by members of the fraternity. The party included guests wearing basketball jerseys, flashing gang signs, and drinking from watermelon cups. The school's decision to ban the chapter was also because the TKE chapter had recently been placed on probation after two members of the fraternity pleaded guilty to the aggravated assault of a student from another fraternity. The national fraternity issued an apology and condemned the event but insisted that the party was \\"without malice or forethought\\", that there were fewer than 30 men and women at the event which didn't meet Arizona State IFC guidelines for an official fraternity function, and that the ASU chapter was one of the most \\"multi-cultural social fraternities\\" at the university. The Rowan University chapter had two men suspended for an illicit sex tape recorded in the fraternity house that was leaked to the public. The California State University San Marcos chapter was suspended after several different complaints of sexual assault and date rape were made against the fraternity. The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee chapter was suspended after several women falsely accused the fraternity of drugging and raping them at the fraternity house. One fraternity member was arrested for possession of marijuana. The Johnson & Wales University chapter had a former pledge sue the fraternity after a brutal hazing ritual that left him hospitalized for over a month. He was branded, urinated on by members, paddled, deprived of sleep, forced to exercise, forced to swim in his own vomit, and asked to participate in a host of many other demeaning activities. He was the only remaining pledge after the rest of his pledge class dropped due to abuse and harassment perpetuated by members of the fraternity. =2013= The American University chapter was disciplined for forcing pledges to binge drink, smoke marijuana, and perform various humiliating tasks. The Arizona State University chapter was placed on probation after 20 TKE members attacked three members of the Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) fraternity. One DKE member was beaten so badly that he had to be transferred to an emergency room with a concussion and broken jaw. =2012= The Butler University chapter was shut down and placed on probation for an undisclosed period of time. School administrators at the time did not release a reason for the chapter's closure. =2011= The Radford University chapter made national headlines after a pledge died partaking in a drinking hazing ritual. Six members of the fraternity were arrested and charged for his death. The Whitman College chapter was publicly accused of abusing and mistreating pledges by a former pledge. The former pledge stated that misconduct by the fraternity was the reason why many members of his pledge class quit the fraternity. =Pre-2011= In 2000, the San Diego State University chapter was expelled for four years after a drinking hazing ritual hospitalized a pledge with alcohol poisoning. In 1996, the La Salle University chapter was suspended after a group from the chapter assaulted members of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. The TKE chapter's charter was subsequently revoked. Notable alumni Chapters and colonies Tau Kappa Epsilon is also affiliated with the German fraternity system known as the Corps of the Weinheimer Senioren- Convent (WSC). The WSC serves as an umbrella organization for 60 student Corps at 22 cities all over Germany. In furtherance of this International fraternal friendship, Past Executive Vice President Timothy J. Murphy became part of Corps Franconia Darmstadt (Darmstadt Technical University) receiving the status of \\"Inhaber der Corpsschleife\\" (IdC), a rarity for a foreign national. He has since spoken at fraternity congresses and gatherings in Weinheim and W√ºrzburg, Germany. Publications =The Teke= The Teke is the award- winning official quarterly publication for undergraduate and alumni brothers of Tau Kappa Epsilon. The magazine features in-depth articles related to topics of interest for TKE members, including chapter news, alumni news, service and foundation annual reports, and articles relating to leadership, professional development, chapter operations, and of general interest to the fraternal world. On October 19, 1907, Wallace G. McCauley delivered his \\"Opportunity out of Defeat\\" speech at the annual initiation banquet of the fraternity, and not only did this speech mark the decision to become a national fraternity, but it also marked the beginning of the official magazine of TKE. In the speech, McCauley stated, \\"Then let us issue a magazine, quarterly as first, name it The Teke, make it attractive and artistic in form.\\" The Teke magazine first appeared in January 1908. The first edition was a 20-page booklet of 7 by 10 inches bound with a gray cover and the title The Teke within a red triangle. Illustrations and photos were first used in Volume II, No. 2 of The Teke. The magazine expanded to the 8.5 by 11.5 inch size in 1935. The Teke was suspended in the 1990s amid financial difficulties for the fraternity, but it was re-established in 1999.Leland, Leland F. (1949). The Golden Book of Tau Kappa Epsilon. \\"TKE and its Publications\\". pp. 121‚Äì129. Tau Kappa Epsilon. =The Teke Guide= The pledge manual of Tau Kappa Epsilon is known as The Teke Guide. Development on the manual began in 1927, and The Teke Guide was first published in 1935. The book was developed to acquaint pledges of TKE with the history, government, organization, idealism, functions, aspirations, and traditions of Tau Kappa Epsilon. The Teke Guide was the first fraternity pledge manual to use a two color printing process. The original book was designed, compiled, and edited by Grand Histor Leland F. Leland. Through the 1950s, The Teke Guide was a spiral bound book of nearly 150 pages. The book was rich with illustrations, including photos of all TKE chapter houses. In 1966, a new hard cover version of The Teke Guide debuted; however, the new version contained significantly reduced content and very few photos. By the 1980s, The Teke Guide had been reduced to a soft cover magazine-like format. The hard cover format returned again by the 1990s, and over the next few years an effort was made to restore the in-depth historical content and photographs that had been stripped from previous versions in order to make the book more of a permanent TKE reference manual for the life of each member. In 2007, the first edition to be printed in full color was issued.\\"Preface ‚Äì Why This Teke Book\\". The Teke Guide, 1946‚Äì1947. p. 9. Tau Kappa Epsilon.

The college is named after its patron saint, Bernard of Clairvaux, and is a member of the Associated Catholic Colleges. It is also part of Edmund Rice Education Australia, a series of schools that focus on teaching the pupils in Edmunds tradition. History St. Bernard's College traces its origins to the establishment of 'St Monica's' at Moonee Ponds in 1917, by Brothers C. O'Keefe and T. Quinn. Students at this school were taken from Grade III to Intermediate (Year 10). In 1940, during the war period, not only were the students sent away to help in project Ireland, the school was also extended to take the Leaving Certificate (Year 11), and this necessitated the building of the first St. Bernard's on the Strand Moonee Ponds, with Brother Cregan as the first Headmaster.St. Bernard's College- Christian Brothers (accessed:26-06-2007) In the mid-1950s, Brother Brendan Murphy organised the purchase of the West Essendon property. While initially used as sporting grounds, building work began at this site in the mid-1960s. Since then, the site has developed with all classes being located at West Essendon by 1995, at which time the Moonee Ponds site was sold. In 2001, the college set up its Santa Monica campus on the Great Ocean Road near Lorne. St Bernard's is the last known site to Tim's Shape factory. Activities =Sports= St. Bernard's is a member of the Associated Catholic Colleges and competes against twelve other schools in sporting fixtures and carnivals.

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot synopsis Ryan Cawdor arrives in the remains of the New Mexico MAT-TRANS chamber with his son Dean, having rescued him from a slave camp to the north. Once they exit the facility the pair see smoke coming from the direction of Jak Lauren's ranch, where their friends Krysty Wroth, J.B. Dix, Dr. Theophilus Tanner, and Mildred Wyeth were waiting for Ryan's return. Ryan and Dean set off for the ranch, fearing the worst. When they arrive they discover the ranch burned to the ground and completely deserted, but curiously find no bodies, not even the remains of the absent livestock. Further adding to the confusion there are only a small number of bullet casings found on the property, and inside the still-standing smokehouse Ryan discovers several pieces of smoked meat infested with maggots. A final, cryptic clue comes when Dean tries to pull water from the well and discovers a note from Krysty affixed to the top of the rope. The note urges Ryan not to drink from the well but offers no other explanation, saying that for some unstated reason there's not enough time for one. Reluctantly Ryan and Dean leave the water and head north, towards their friends. Several miles north the pair come across a deep mining pit, now filled with bodies. Dean examines them up close, discovering each has been shot through the head, apparently at point-blank range. Disturbingly, this includes at least a dozen children. Finally as they head into the foothills, Ryan discovers a long note from Krysty, explaining the situation. Sometime after Ryan's departure, an oxen train of religious settlers passed by the Lauren farm, asking for permission to camp nearby for the night. Jak and his wife Christina cautiously agreed, but along with Ryan's friends made plans to watch their new guests carefully. This proved wise, as that night a number of the settlers attempted to take the ranch by force. Poorly armed and ill-organized, the attackers were quickly fended off and killed. Somewhat alarming signs of sickness on the corpses of the attackers led Mildred to examine other members of the group. She discovered advanced symptoms of the bubonic plague, but an even more disturbing discovery came when Mildred learned the time between the onset of symptoms and the near-terminal stages seen in her examinations was less than two days. Furthermore, the disease appeared to be excessively virulent, among other symptoms causing uncontrollable diarrhea. With the ranch house and immediate area fouled by stricken settlers, including the well, Mildred declared the area needed to be sterilized using the only guaranteed method available: fire. Since the settlers were still a possible combat risk and all just hours away from an agonizing death, it was agreed that they should all be killed. Mildred did so personally, administering a single headshot to each settler. The bodies were then taken by Doc Tanner via oxcart to the mining pit to be interred. The friends then released the Laurens' livestock, intending to round them up later, set fire to the ranch with gasoline, and departed north. The mystery surrounding the ranch now explained, Ryan and Dean head further into the hills to make camp. During dinner they are surprised by a sec hunter, the fifth of a set of merciless robotic hunters that Ryan mistakenly activated while rescuing his son. The 'droid is programmed to kill Ryan and Ryan alone, at any cost, and has evidently followed him through the MAT-TRANS system. It is heavily damaged, evidently in the course of its pursuit, but is still a potent threat. Attempts to shoot it blind it but do not stop it, and Ryan's one effort at close-quarters combat nearly kills him. Finally Ryan wades into a nearby pond. The sec hunter follows, but stops just shy of the water level reaching its chest. Realizing the damage it has suffered has made some elements of the 'droid no longer waterproof, Ryan pulls the sec hunter fully into the water, escaping with only a heavy blow to the back. The sec hunter shorts out spectacularly, eventually going dark and sinking into the pond. Just a few minutes later, Krysty, Jak, Christina, and Doc Tanner arrive, reuniting with the Cawdors. The next day Ryan, Krysty, and Jak set off to meet J. B. and Mildred, who have camped in a box canyon to watch over the Lauren's recovered livestock. As they near the edge of the canyon they spot stickies, a particularly vicious breed of mutant so named because of the octopus-like suckers which coat their palms and other parts of their bodies, allowing them to grapple onto surfaces easily, as well as rip the flesh from a human body with trivial ease. The stickies are prone, overlooking the canyon and sighting on something, presumably J. B. and Mildred, through rifles. The three companions quickly dispatch the stickies, only to be held at gunpoint when the rest of the stickies move in behind them. Jak is able to escape, while Ryan and Krysty are tied up and taken to the stickies' camp several miles away. The leader of the stickies is an unusually intelligent and unusually (for a sticky) blond-haired mutant named Charlie. Almost 20 years prior Ryan, J. B., and a Trader man named Abe cleared out a nest of stickies. The only survivor left was a strangely blond sticky child: Charlie. Resentful over the death of his parents, but equally resentful of their unintelligent, barbaric lifestyle which led to their extermination, Charlie has become well-educated and intelligent, and has organized a large group of fellow stickies into a functioning community, rather than an animalistic nest. He gleefully tells Ryan that his leadership is asserted by periodically and publicly killing \\"norms\\", something he says he will enjoy even more when it is Ryan. Ryan and Krysty are placed in a pit used to hold captives, and discover one of the eight other people there is none other than Abe. This comes as a surprise, since they had assumed Abe was killed while trying to reach the first redoubt. Though shot in the neck with an arrow, Abe was able to remove the shaft and recovered after several months, leaving him with two scars and a ragged voice. The reunion is bittersweet, especially when Charlie tells the captives be intends to have killed all of them within three days. Ryan begins trying to formulate a plan. The next day the sticky camp is visited by \\"fladgies\\", religious worshipers who practice flagellation on themselves and each other. The stickies take them captive, and, in a grim form of irony, decide to whip them to death. In an effort to save himself the leader of the group tells Charlie about a large group of armed lepers he saw heading towards the camp, intent on taking it for their own. Charlie heeds the warning, but allows the fladgies to be whipped to death anyway. That night, while planning an escape attempt, the captives are interrupted when Ryan is ordered out of the pit. He is tied up and taken by a female sticky who previously made unreturned advances to Ryan while serving him food. Once in her home, the sticky binds Ryan to the bed and then rapes him. After the third time she forces him to perform cunnilingus on her, then attempts to smother him while in this position. Ryan is only saved when the sticky is shot by a leper, one of many now attacking the sticky camp. The leper decides to shoot Ryan as well, only to be shot by an unseen sticky. With both assailants dead Ryan is able to free and arm himself. He makes his way to the holding pit and frees Krysty, Abe, and the other captives; they then recover their confiscated weapons from Charlie's home and make their escape through the mountains. In the process they suffer some losses, and Abe is wounded by a musket shot, making it necessary to carry him. Eventually the group is reunited with J.B., Mildred, Doc Tanner, Dean, and Jak and Christina Lauren, who have come to rescue Ryan and Krysty. Mildred examines Abe's wound and determines it isn't necessarily fatal, but will need careful observation. When his condition begins to worsen Ryan elects to stay with Abe in a derelict town, in the hopes of allowing him time to regain some health. Jak decides to stay with him, while the rest continue on, hoping to lead Charlie and the band of pursuing stickies away from Abe, Jak, and Ryan. This proves mostly successful, as Charlie investigates the town only briefly before continuing on; however, he leaves behind three scouts who find Ryan and Jak. They are able to kill them all, but not before the third scout stabs Jak in the chest, hitting his lung. Meanwhile, Charlie catches up to the fleeing group, only to be caught in a well-orchestrated trap; he escapes, but all of his companions are killed. Charlie returns to the town, Ryan's friends in pursuit. He draws Ryan out by holding the injured Jak at gunpoint, but before he can kill him he is wounded by a brick thrown by one of the freed captives. A partially recovered Abe then attacks Charlie, wielding a piece of glass as a dagger, and stabs him in the stomach. The sticky is able to overpower Abe and escape. Two months later the companions are at the Lauren's newly built ranch. Abe has recovered fully, and Jak, while touch and go for a while, is now healed, albeit with minor lung damage. Christina has given birth to Jak's daughter, Jessica; she is also openly resentful towards Ryan for his perceived role in nearly killing her husband. For that reason, Ryan has elected to leave with his friends that day. As he is saying his goodbyes to Jak, Christina calmly calls both of them to the back of the house. There they find Charlie, freshly killed, and Christina holding an axe. Charlie had arrived, begging for food, but made the mistake of threatening Jessica, prompting Christina to kill him with the nearby axe. She then further reiterates her desire for Ryan to leave, to which he agrees. The companions travel back to the MAT-TRANS chamber under the destroyed redoubt, Abe now with them. When the jump completes Ryan opens his eye and finds something is very wrong....

It is on the edge of the Arafura Swamp in Arnhem Land. The population is approximately 800 people, though this fluctuates and there is a significant housing shortage. The community was established in the early 1970s, and became recognised as Aboriginal land with the passage of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. A written permit is required to visit Ramingining. The village has an airstrip at Ramingining Airport, a general store, a school, a police station, and a health clinic. Djambarrpuyngu is the main language in Ramingining, though Gupapuyngu and Ganalbingu are also spoken. The village, along with near-by Murwangi, was also the source for many of the actors in the 2006 film Ten Canoes. After the film sparked worldwide interest in Yolngu and Australian Aboriginal culture, a spin-off educational project known as Twelve Canoes was created, in collaboration with the people at Ramingining, which includes a website and twelve short films. The film of the twelve segments was shown on SBS TV in Australia, and has been available online. Alcohol is banned in Ramingining. It cannot be consumed by residents or visitors. Kava used to be legally available, but was banned in the entire Northern Territory in August 2007 as a part of the federal government's intervention on Indigenous affairs. Ramingining school is paired with a sister school in Cockatoo, Victoria, Cockatoo Primary School. Exchange visits are organised where groups of Year 5 pupils and accompanying teachers visit Ramingining for a week. A few weeks or months later, Ramingining students from Year 5 and 6 visit Cockatoo Primary School. A program that started in 2009 saw year nine boys from St Kevin's College in Melbourne visit Ramingining, which started a regular exchange program. Loreto Mandeville Hall in Melbourne also runs an exchange program.

Prodigy is a student at the Xavier Institute, member of the New X-Men squad, and, for a time, a member of the Young Avengers. Publication history Created by writers Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir and artist Keron Grant, David Alleyne first appeared in New Mutants, vol. 2 #4 (October 2003). He was originally a mutant with the ability to absorb the knowledge and skills of anyone within a limited distance. He could not control this ability and would forget his acquired knowledge once they became out of range. He attends the Xavier Institute and becomes co-leader of the New Mutants training squad. After the events of House of M and the ensuing \\"Decimation\\" of mutants, David loses his powers, but he remains at the Institute, becoming a member of the New X-Men team and utilizing his natural intellect to assist his teammates. He later regains all the knowledge and skills he had absorbed before becoming depowered, including many of the X-Men's considerable expertise in science and physical combat, making him a stronger addition to the X-Men. Despite being human, he remains with the X-Men as a substitute instructor and trainee for stories over a number of years. He later regains his powers through the use of the resurrection protocols. Fictional character biography =Early life and moving to the Xavier Institute= David Alleyne is a naturally intelligent boy, who finds upon becoming a teenager that the answers to his exams and assignments begin appearing in his head whenever he is in the same room as his teachers. He realizes that he is a mutant with the ability to know anything that the people nearby know. Wanting to retain this knowledge, David becomes driven to study even harder. He takes college-level courses while finishing high school and drops subtle hints to his family about his powers, but they fail to realize he is a mutant until the campus anti-mutant group ousts him. Realizing he can no longer be a mutant in secrecy, David accepts an invitation from Danielle Moonstar to attend the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. His parents and sister are supportive of his decision. At the school he befriends Wind Dancer, Wallflower and Wither.New Mutants vol. 2 #5 (November 2003) They are attacked by the Reavers, and afterwards Dani makes David roommates with one of these Reavers, Josh Foley.New Mutants vol. 2 #6 (December 2003) The tactic works, and David soon comes to regard Josh as a little brother.New Mutants vol. 2 #7-9, 12 Along with his other friends at the school, they bring to Xavier Institute the homeless mutant Surge, who David acquires an immediate interest in.New Mutants vol. 2 #9-10, New X-Men: Academy X #1 David, Josh, Surge, Wind Dancer, Wallflower, and Wither are placed on Dani's squad of students, called \\"the New Mutants,\\" and David is given the codename Prodigy.New X-Men: Academy X #2 (August 2004) Not liking the idea that he is being groomed to be an X-Man, David declines to be the team leader, leaving the position to Wind Dancer. However, she quickly loses faith in her ability to lead. They compromise by becoming team co-leaders. Prodigy later learns that his mental blocks can be removed, allowing him to permanently retain the knowledge he absorbs, but he first experiences a telepathic illusion created by Dani and Emma Frost of a possible future based from that decision. In it, David excels by gaining the knowledge of the most important and intellectual individuals in the world, bringing a near-utopia to the globe, through genocide and the killing of his friends and the X-Men. The illusion ends with Surge, his wife, overloading her powers, killing them both in order to stop him. On seeing the illusion, he rejects having his mental blocks removed and begins to avoid Surge. However, she later confronts him, stating that what he saw was only an illusion of his worst fears, and David begins a relationship with her. =Power loss and the New X-Men= In the \\"Decimation\\" storyline following the events of House of M, David is one of the many mutants who loses his powers because of the Scarlet Witch. Planning to leave the school, David reveals that he built a \\"Danger Cave\\" to replace the destroyed Danger Room before he lost his powers. The facility allows his teammates to train by reliving former X-Men missions. David's parents and Cyclops decide that it would be safer for David to remain at the mansion since William Stryker is targeting depowered mutants as well. When Stryker attacks the mansion, David saves the Stepford Cuckoos and is wounded by one of the Purifiers. He joins the New X-Men later when they leave to fight the mutant-hunting future Sentinel, Nimrod. David proves useful to the team when he attacks the robot with the heavy artillery. After returning to the mansion, he is invited to join his girlfriend Surge in running the New X-Men squad, giving them free rein to add more members at their will. In the \\"Quest for Magik\\" storyline, the demon Belasco senses Magik's returned presence due to her temporary revival during House of M, but cannot locate her and fails to magically revive her (instead creating the dark, soulless form of Illyana called Darkchilde, whom he banishes in disgust). Sensing her presence on the students at the Institute due to their involvement with her in the \\"House of M\\" reality, he incapacitated the X-Men and sucks the students into Limbo, including David, whose eyesight was healed to normal vision by Josh using his newly acquired medical expertise. Belasco interrogates David about her whereabouts, but since none of the students remember the House of M reality, he is confused and tells her that she is still dead. Enraged, Belasco kills David by ripping out his heart. Some of the students break free and attack Belasco, while Josh manages to immediately regrow David's heart with his powers, bringing him back to life. While the students battle against Belasco, David realizes that his weakness is telepathy, having put special helmets to block the telepathic powers of Stepford Cuckoos and Martha Johansson. David directs X-23 to free the Cuckoos, who launch a telepathic attack on Belasco. Though initially successful, the Cuckoos are forced out of Belasco's mind, but he is ultimately defeated by Pixie and Darkchilde. The students are later returned to Earth by Darkchilde, when she seals off all entrances to Limbo. =Regaining knowledge and skills= Prodigy and Surge's relationship comes to an end soon after. Learning of David's near-death experience in Limbo, Surge fears for his safety and attempts to force him to leave the school by kissing Hellion in front of him. David prepares to leave, but is confronted by the Cuckoos, who offer to remove his mental blocks as thanks for saving them during Stryker's attack, restoring all the past knowledge and skills he absorbed when he had his powers. Though he can no longer absorb other people's knowledge, he now possesses the collective knowledge and skills of every individual he absorbed before the onset of Decimation, including Beast's vast medical and technological expertise and the elite fighting skills of several of the X-Men. Using Krav Maga martial arts picked up from Wolverine and Shadowcat, he displays his newfound assets by besting Hellion in combat, fully aware that the kiss had just been a ploy. He then breaks up with Surge and is appointed as a substitute instructor by Cyclops. In the X-Men crossover event X-Men: Messiah Complex, the X-Men, the Marauders, Predator X, as well as the anti- mutant Purifiers all race to recover the first mutant child born since M-Day, who was kidnapped from her hometown. Thinking the Purifiers may have the baby, Surge leads the New X-Men in a mission against to attack the Purifiers' base and recover her. Prodigy declines participation and stays behind at the school, viewing the mission to be largely out of vengeance against the Purifiers for their murdered schoolmates than to truly locate the baby. While the New X-Men are away on their mission, the school is attacked by O*N*E Sentinels controlled by Cassandra Nova's nano-bots. Prodigy assists Beast in the hospital wing stabilizing the severely injured students and faculty. He later repairs Cerebro with the Cuckoos, who state that they find the structure of his brain fascinating. =Manifest Destiny & Utopia= After the events of Messiah Complex, the X-Men disband and later reform in San Francisco. Prodigy relocates with the X-Men to assist Beast in setting up Cerebro. He continues to work with the X-Men, though he is no longer on any active teams, instead running the new Danger RoomRunaways Vol 3 # 10 and assisting the X-Men during the Skrull invasionSecret Invasion: X-Men #1-4 and the take over of San Francisco by Norman Osborn and his Dark X-Men as well as joining the rest of the mutants to the Mutant island Utopia where he assists Cyclops keeping the island maintained.Uncanny X-Men #513Deadpool vol. 2 #16 He is later seen in the field helping out Hellion and Surge deal with the resurrected Rusty Collins.X-Force #21 =Second Coming= Cyclops leaves Prodigy in charge of surveillance of the island's resources after a barrage of attacks by Bastion.X-Force #25 Beast and Prodigy access a dome placed over Utopia and San Francisco and come to the conclusion that the dome is able to send over hundreds of thousands of Nimrods over to kill the X-Men and remaining mutants, causing him to break down emotionally.X-Force #27 =Schism and Regenesis= When a giant Sentinel attacks Utopia, Prodigy joins in the fight along with the other students to help destroy it.Generation Hope #13 When Wolverine decides to leave Utopia and return to Westchester to reopen the school, Prodigy is among the younger X-Men who choose to stay at Utopia.X-Men: Regenesis =Young Avengers= Bitter and disillusioned at Cyclops' manipulation, David is later seen working at a superhuman call center, where he uses his knowledge to help various people solve superhuman crises. While employed there, he meets and befriends Tommy Shepherd, the former Young Avenger Speed. The two work together on a stakeout to catch a thief dressed as Patriot, but the plan goes awry when the criminal dissipates Tommy's body and then fades away.Young Avengers (Vol. 2) #6 He joins the Young Avengers to help them find Speed and while stranded in another dimension with Hulkling, he kisses him. In issue #9 he reveals he is bisexual.Young Avengers (Vol. 2) #8Young Avengers (Vol. 2) #9 After the main villain of the Vol was eliminated, he was talking to Patri-not and came up with a theory that he will become Patri-not in the future. During this he accidentally kisses the entity, allowing Tommy to reappear. Their relationship is later revisited in Lords Of Empyre Emperor Hulkling where they are seemingly together. In the one-shot Lords of Empyre: Emperor Hulkling, written by Chip Zdarsky and queer author Anthony Oliveira, around Empyre, Marvel's summer 2020 crossover event, Oliveira brings Prodigy and Speed into canon as a gay couple out drinking with Hulkling, who describes that they \\"always have exactly one and a half drinks and start making out\\". Prodigy is featured in the 'Original Sins' five-issue limited series. Marvel Boy, Prodigy and Hulkling become involved in the plans by the Hood to siphon off cosmic knowledge endangering innocent people. There are multiple betrayals and back-tracking, as the heroes are convinced the knowledge driving the civilians mad could be safely converted into data that helps all of humanity.\\"Original Sins\\" #1‚Äì5 (2014) It is shown later that Prodigy auditions to be the security expert at the new Stark Industries, though he loses the job to Ant-Man.\\"Ant-Man\\" (Vol. 2) #1 Prodigy enrolls in the extra-dimensional Sotomayor University.America Vol 1. #1 (2017) He develops a close friendship with the superhero America Chavez. He helps protect the University from multiple threats, external and internal. Prodigy makes his own friends, such as with the Sotomayor fraternity called 'The Betas' and an outside group of allies unofficially known as the 'Chavez Guerrillas'. America Vol 1. #11 (2017) After regaining his powers through the use of Krakoa's resurrection protocols, Prodigy Has recently joined a new X-factor team, assembled to investigate suspicious mutant deaths before said resurrection protocols can be utilized on them. Powers and abilities Prodigy has the telepathic ability to absorb and mimic the knowledge and skills from the minds of the people in close proximity to him. A side effect of his powers are self-imposed mental blocks, which prevents him from retaining the knowledge he absorbs, forgetting whatever he has learned after a short period of time.New Mutants vol. 2 #4 (October 2003) The power is completely involuntary,New Mutants vol. 2 #9 (February 2004)New X-Men: Academy X #2 and absorbs only studied knowledge, not thoughts, short-term information, or awareness.New X-Men: Academy X #1 Since losing his powers, he maintains a high intellect, due to his extensive studying prior to coming to Xavier's. He creates a Danger Cave, a training room for the rest of his peers, and shows an extensive knowledge of the past missions of the X-Men.New X-Men vol. 2 #21 When the mental blocks in his mind are removed by the Stepford Cuckoos, David later regains access to all the skills and knowledge that he absorbed when he was still a mutant. He can recall the fighting abilities and scientific knowledge of many of the X-Men including Beast's medical knowledge, Forge's and Professor Xavier's expertise in various subjects, Wolverine and Kitty Pryde's martial arts, etc. He has since regained his powers without losing all of the above knowledge. Along with his intellect, Prodigy has displayed great competency as a leader. Both CyclopsNew X-Men: Academy X #10 and Danielle MoonstarNew X-Men: Academy X #7 have acknowledged his leadership skills. Other versions =House of M= In the House of M universe, David was once more a member of the New Mutants. The New Mutants were a group of young mutants trained to be diplomats, and David graduated the valedictorian. Prodigy once more acts as the leader of the New Mutants (although in this case it's more unofficial). He leads the New Mutants in an attempt to save Nori's father. While initially conflicting with rival group the Hellions, the two groups would join together after learning of tortures of humans. David, along with the rest of the surviving New Mutants and the Hellions, would later make their last stand against Sunfire and his army. =Too Much Information= In the New X-Men storyline \\"Too Much Information,\\" David asks Emma Frost and Danielle Moonstar to remove the mental blocks keeping him from retaining the knowledge he absorbs. Unknown to David at the time, it was an illusion created by Dani, which was enhanced by Emma Frost's telepathic abilities to show him what might happen if the blocks were removed. In the illusion, David quickly surpasses all the teachers at the school, having permanently retained all the knowledge they possessed. David leaves the institute, telling Josh Foley (Elixir) that he would use Josh's healing power to heal every disease known to mankind for free. Three months later, David has gained the knowledge of Stephen Hawking, Tony Stark, Henry Kissinger, and many other prominent geniuses simply by passing near them. He announces at a press conference that he has cures for AIDS, cancer and every other known disease. He plans to distribute this cure across the entire country in a matter of weeks. However, these cures come at a high price, as Josh dies during the medical procedure that harvested the tissue from his body needed for the cures. David mourns his friend, but firmly believes that his unwilling sacrifice was just. Eighteen years later, David has married former teammate Surge, been elected President of the United States, eliminated poverty, unemployment, and discrimination against mutants and has nearly created a worldwide government. The only major holdout is China, which he plans to bomb via teleportation. Noriko secretly shares this information with the X-Men in hopes that they can prevent a mass genocide. However, before they can act on this information, David sends them on a false mission to investigate a satellite that he causes to explode, killing them. Seeking a convenient scapegoat, he declares that the already outlaw Hellions are terrorist threats and blames them for killing the X-Men. The Hellions and reformed New Mutants join forces when many of the dark secrets of David's rise to power come to light. The combined groups (Hellion, Mercury, Tag, Rockslide, Wither, Wind Dancer, Icarus, Surge, and Wallflower) stage an assault on the White House, but David's security forces (XSE agents, Bishop, Storm, and Angel Salvadore) kill most of the heroes. In the end, Noriko confronts David in the Oval Office, then uses her powers to destroy the White House and everyone remaining in it. Though an illusion, it had a lasting effect on how he viewed his powers.New X-Men vol. 2 #43 =X-Men: The End= Prodigy briefly appears in X-Men: The End, as an agent of the X.S.E. Along with Iceman, he interrogates Sage. Prodigy absorbs all the information she knows, and is deeply troubled with what he finds out. When joined by Val Cooper, he reveals that she is an impostor. She responds by transforming into a Warskrull, killing Prodigy shortly after.

The work consists entirely of rapid arpeggios and harmonic modulations based on A-flat major. Robert Schumann praised this work in a dissertation on the √âtudes; calling it \\"a poem rather than a study\\", he coined for it the alternate name \\"Aeolian Harp\\".Schumann, 12 Etuden f√ºr Pianoforte von Friedrich Chopin, in: Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, Leipzig, December 22, 1837, p. 199‚Äì200. Quoted by Kullak, quoted by James Huneker in Chopin: the Man and His Music (1900). It is also sometimes known as \\"The Shepherd Boy,\\" following an unsupported tale by Kleczy≈Ñski that Chopin advised a pupil to picture a shepherd boy taking refuge in a grotto to avoid a storm playing the melody on his flute.Johnson, p. 80  Structure  First measures of Chopin's √âtude Op. 25, No. 1. (Urtext edition). This √©tude comprises a right-hand melody and supportive bass line, the accompaniment consisting of broken chords, provided by the inner voices of both hands, usually in semiquaver-tuplets. The left hand introduces polyrhythms from time to time. The principal melody is presented by the right hand on the first note of each group of sextuplets, with occasional counter-melodies provided by the inner voices. The distinctive theme is presented in A-flat major. Through metamorphic modulations to closely related keys, it eventually arrives at a brief episode in the remote key of A major, but culminates with an intense climax in the home key, and a momentary reference to the original thematic material, which flows easily into the coda. Technique Technically, the piece requires both dexterity and velocity, good balance and weighting of the arms. The inner voice figures consist of repeated figures of arpeggiated chords. Schumann commented on Chopin's subtle emphasis on certain melodies throughout this piece.\\"Chopin Etude 25.1\\", In the Hands. March 13, 2007. One difficulty the √©tude presents is the voicing of the inner counter-melodies. The three annotated studies by Leopold Godowsky on this etude exploit this aspect of this piece and also introduce the student to further possibilities in the Chopin original.

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot synopsis Ryan Cawdor awakes following a MAT-TRANS jump and finds himself in an environment with a decreased amount of oxygen, as well as apparently lower gravity. Dr. Theophilus Tanner awakes as well, and with (for him) remarkable clarity reasons that they must have jumped to a MAT-TRANS facility not on the planet. Along with Krysty Wroth, J. B. Dix, Mildred Wyeth, Ryan's son Dean Cawdor, and former Trader associate Abe, the group cautiously explores the facility. Doc's near-certain hypothesis is confirmed when they discover viewing portholes, showing them an unbroken view of stars, clearly placing them in space somewhere. Though possessing a good knowledge of astronomy, J. B. is unable to recognize any constellations seen through the portholes, making it possible that the facility is not orbiting around the Earth. The facility is empty, full of corpses who appear to have died of unknown causes, possibly a disease, just weeks prior. Exploration of the facility leads to the space station's bridge; there Ryan finds a folder containing the station's logs for the past several months. However, entering the bridge triggers an automatic self-destruct countdown, and Ryan loses the folder when he drops it while leaving the bridge, seconds before the security doors shut. The companions make it to the MAT-TRANS chamber and jump out just before the malfunctioning, accelerated countdown reaches zero. The next jump takes the group to a redoubt somewhere under Chicago, revealed by graffiti left on the walls. A map indicates the facility has been mostly cleared by evacuating personnel during the beginning of the Great Dark, but two areas of interest are not marked as cleared: the garage, and the chron-jump section. This last part attracts Doc Tanner's attention: \\"chron-jump\\" was the name given to the government department responsible for \\"trawling\\" him forward in time from 1896. The companions agree to investigate the section. When they arrive they find it still functional, prepared to execute a trawling of three targets from just scant weeks before the beginning of the Great Dark. The companions decide to make an attempt to bring the targets forward, reasoning that it may save people who would otherwise die in the nuclear holocaust. The first attempt is unsuccessful, producing an unpleasant collection of disconnected body parts and gore. The second target arrives intact and alive, but curiously she is bound in a straitjacket. Careful examination of the information on the computer reveals that she is a clinically insane mass murderer, convicted of torturing, castrating, and murdering dozens of young boys. Disgusted, Ryan kills her with a shot to the head. The third trawling attempt is successful as well, bringing forward a 19-year-old man named Michael, a member of an isolated Christian monastic order who has been trained in the fictional martial art of Tao-Tain-Do. Brother Michael is skeptical of the story the companions tell him, but accepts that his situation is beyond his control. Reluctantly, he follows them. The redoubt's garage contains a fully operational war wag, and the companions set out in it to explore the ruins of Chicago. The city turns out to be not just destroyed but nearly leveled, possibly from high incendiary warheads, leaving only a flat, charred, black wasteland. The level of destruction is shocking to nearly everyone, including Brother Michael. Unable to deny that the companions' story is true, Michael declares that he can no longer consider himself a member of the order, no longer \\"Brother\\" Michael. Since he lacks a last name, Doc Tanner suggests he use \\"Brother\\"; Michael accepts, christening himself \\"Michael Brother\\". The group takes shelter in a stripped Victorian mansion; that evening they are attacked by a large group of mutants. Michael, who already has displayed remarkable speed and reflexes, singlehandedly kills a group of at least a dozen mutants while armed only with a pair of knives. This does not escape Ryan's notice, who concludes Michael may be faster than even Jak Lauren. Towards the end of the attack Abe is wounded lightly by a mutant. Enraged, he follows the fleeing mutant into the night, only to fall into a rapid-flowing, rock-strewn river while grappling with the mutie. The companions find no sign of him, and presume him dead. The next day, however, they are startled to find some distance away alongside the road, battered, naked, but alive. Abe explains that he had nearly drowned before someone pulled him free of the river. When he was able to see the person, he recognized him as none other than the Trader. Both Ryan and J.B. are incredulous, believing their former employer is dead, but Abe maintains that it was him. He then says he plans to stay behind in order to track down the Trader and, ideally, join up with him. Abe parts company with the companions on good, if bittersweet, terms. While the companions stop to attempt repairs on the rapidly worsening war wag, Doc and Michael surreptitiously depart. Doc intends to go back to the chron-jump section and attempt to send himself back in time to be reunited with his family, and has convinced Michael to assist him and be sent back as well. As they travel by foot Doc's mental state becomes increasingly unstable, with him often mistaking Michael for his long-dead wife Emily. Meanwhile, Krysty is kidnapped by a group of highly organized, female mutants. Calling themselves \\"Midnight\\" because of their large, nocturnally adapted eyes, the group believe Krysty is the \\"fire-haired\\" leader mentioned in their group mythology who will free them from their subterranean existence. Krysty soon learns other, disturbing things about Midnight, particularly that they are an all female group by virtue of killing any male offspring, and also practice cannibalism, including on their doomed male infants. In order to find Krysty's whereabouts, Ryan, J. B., Mildred, and Dean capture one member of a Midnight sec patrol. Though initially resistant to interrogation by Ryan, the captured woman reveals the necessary information when Mildred \\"persuades\\" her using her extensive medical knowledge and a scalpel. Shaken but resolved, the group heads to the mutants' lair to rescue Krysty. During the initial assault Dean is separated from the group, eventually captured and placed in the same cell as Krysty. With someone there to help her afterward, Krysty calls upon her enhanced strength to break the chains binding both her and Dean. Dean kills the arriving pair of guards, recovering his and Krysty's weapons in the process, and helps the severely weakened woman make her escape. After a brief gunfight most of the Midnight leadership are killed, and the group reunites and flees to the surface. The companions make their way to the redoubt, and find Michael and Doc in the chron-jump facility, prepared for a jump whose countdown is fast approaching execution. The machinery is obviously malfunctioning, but Doc refuses to leave the jump chamber, protected by Michael and holding the group at gunpoint. Ryan manages to disable Michael by faking a stagger and then kicking him in the groin, and Mildred disarms Doc by shooting a support on the chamber's lid, knocking the weapon from his hand when the lid swings down. They manage to drag Doc from the chamber a few seconds before the jump executes, whereupon the chamber malfunctions spectacularly and bursts into flames. Doc apologizes profusely for his behavior, which the group accepts. After some time to recover, the companions make their way to the MAT-TRANS chamber; Michael accompanies them. Ryan closes the door and initiates the jump.

Reign As per the wish of Swargadeo Rudra Singha on his deathbed, he was succeeded by his eldest son Siba Singha (reigned 1714‚Äì1744). Siba Singha ascended the throne and assumed the Ahom name Sutanphaa. He gave up Rudra Singha's plan to organise a confederacy of the rajas of Hindustan and to invade Bengal (Mughal Empire), but obeyed his father's injunction to become a disciple of Krishnaram Bhattacharjya (Nyayavagish), the Shakta priest from nearby Nabadwip in West Bengal. He gave the management of the Kamakhya Temple to Krishnaram, who came to be known as Parbatiya Gosain, as his residence was on top of the Nilachal hill. Siba Singha accepted him as the royal priest and made a large number of land grants to temples and Brahmin priests. = Dafla expedition = His long 30-year reign was peaceful. In January 1717 there was an expedition against the Daflas of the northern hills, who had again taken to raiding the plains people. After they had been reduced to submission, an embankment was constructed along the foot of the hills inhabited by them as protection against future raids. = Bar Rajas = Siba Singha was a staunch Shakta and was greatly influenced by the Brahmin priests and astrologers. In 1722 he was so alarmed by their prediction that his rule would shortly come to end, that he not only made many and lavish presents to various temples and the Brahmins, in hope of conciliating the gods and averting the calamity, but also endeavoured to satisfy the alleged decree of fate by a subterfuge which greatly diminished his prestige in the eyes of his people. He declared his chief queen Phuleswari, who assumed the name Pramateswari Devi (one of the names of Durga), and the title \\"Bar Raja\\" or chief king. Phuleswari minted coins in joint name of her and her husband where she used Persian legend, the first of its kind in Assam. Phuleswari was more under the influence of the Brahmins, particularly the Parvatiya Gosain, than the king had been. It is believed that this was instigated by Gosain and in her zeal for Sakta Hinduism she attempted to make Saktism the State religion. With this objective, she ordered the Vaishnava gosains to worship the goddess Durga. She then forbade the worship of other deities and personally supervised the act of desecration of the Sonarijan camp. Learning that the Sudra Mahantas were strong monotheists, she held a Durga puja in the capital Rangpur and forced Moamoria and several other gosains to offer oblations to the goddess and smeared sacrificial blood on their foreheads. The Moamarias never forgave this insult to their spiritual leader, and half a century later, they broke out in open rebellion, which came to be known as the Moamoria rebellion. Phuleswari died in 1731. The king then married her sister Dropadi, and made her the Bar Raja with the name Ambika. She died about 1738, and was succeeded by another wife named Enadari who took the name Sarbeswari on becoming Bar Raja. Siba Singha erected numerous temples and gave away land for the support of the Brahmins and temples with all the generosity of a new convert. Siva Singha was a great patron of literature and music. According to one Buranji he was himself the writer of a number of hymns. It was during his reign that Sakta Hinduism became the predominant religion of Assam. = Administrative and public works= Siba Singha is said to have established such an elaborate system of espionage during his reign that he had accurate information of everything that was done or even spoken in all parts of his kingdom. During Siba Singha's reign, the chief public works were the construction of Dhai Ali and the tanks and temples at Gaurisagar, Sibsagar and Kalugaon. About south west of Sivasagar town by the side of what is now National Highway-37, Bar Raja Phuleswari Konwari, the first wife of king Siba Sngha built three temples ‚Äì Shiva Dol, Vishnu Dol and Devi Dol ‚Äì on the bank of a big tank covering an area of including the banks. This big tank was dedicated in the name of 'Gauri' or 'Durga', thus it is known as Gaurisagar tank and the entire place is now known as Gaurisagar. She also had dug the Borpatra tank at Kalugaon beside the historical Jerenga Pathar in memory of her brother who happened to be a Borpatra Gohain during her regime. On the north-eastern side of that tank, two temples, namely Bishnu Dol and Jagadhatri Dol were constructed on the bank of the tank named as Lakshmisagar Pukhuri. It was during his second wife Bar Raja Ambika's rule the Sibsagar tank, Bar Pukhuri, situated within the heart of Sivasagar town was dug. On its banks three temples were built in 1734 ‚Äì the Shiva Dol, the Vishnu Dol and the Devi Dol. Many temples were also constructed by Swargadeo Siba Singha in Kamrup including Shripur Dewaloy (a Devi temple), Ballilecha Shri Shri Kali Dewaloy (a Kali temple), Jaypal Than, Basudev Dewaloy; all located in present Nalbari district. In Sualkuchi he built the Sidheswar Dewaloy, a Shiva temple. And in Dergoan (Golaghat district) he also constructed Burhi Goshani Than. At Aswaklanta, North Guwahati on the bank of the river Brahmaputra in 1720, Siba Singha built two big temples dedicated to Lord Janardana and Lord Vishnu. Siba Singha had the land surveyed in Kamrup and Bakata. The register, or Pera Kagaz, based on this survey of Kamrup was still used at the time of the British occupation. This contained a list of all occupied lands, except homesteads with their areas, and particularly of all rent free estates. It was recorded that in 1739, four Europeans, whose names appear to have been Bill, Godwin, Lister, and Mill, visited King Siba Singha at Rangpur. The king met them at the principal gate of the city where, it is said, they did him homage by falling prostrate at his feet. =Death= Siva Singha died in 1744 and Pramatta Singha, the second son of Rudra Singha ascended the throne.

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot synopsis Ryan Cawdor, his son Dean, Krysty Wroth, J. B. Dix, Dr. Theophilus Tanner, Mildred Wyeth, and Michael Brother arrive in an icy redoubt via a surprisingly pleasant MAT-TRANS jump. The redoubt is both small and thoroughly stripped, its only occupants a curious breed of concrete-burrowing albino worms in one small section of the facility. A minor situation occurs when a worm latches onto Dean while he is urinating, necessitating its careful removal by his father. Using a sextant, J. B. places their location somewhere in Colorado. With no supplies in the redoubt the companions venture out into the snowy wilderness, making camp some distance away. That night they are briefly joined by a trio of poachers, who inform them they are on land belonging to Baron Alferd Nelson of the ville of Vista. They also ask the companions' assistance in hunting a large mutant bear in the area; the companions agree, but sneak away once the poachers are asleep, not wanting to potentially run afoul of a Baron. Unfortunately the group is set upon the next day by the bear in question, a monstrous -long Grizzly standing tall at the shoulder. With some difficulty they are able to kill it, the gunfire attracting the poachers. The gunfire also attracts Vista sec boss Rick Coburn and a contingent of his men. Coburn has the poachers executed, then takes Ryan and his friends prisoner and escorts them back to meet with the Baron. During the trip Ryan converses with Coburn, and assesses him as both extremely competent and (reluctantly) likeable. Baron Nelson proves to be a large, powerfully built man, standing over tall. Initially he orders the group hanged, but quickly changes his mind when Coburn points out that there are women and a child in the group. At the urging of his dowager mother, Nelson confides that he recently lost his wife and son, his wife when he strangled her for adultery with members of a group of roaming \\"trappers\\", and his son being brutally tortured and killed by others of the same group. Nelson has since learned that the \\"trappers\\" were in the employ of Wizard Sidler, the Baron of nearby Yuma and son of the late former baron of Vista. Later that night Alferd has Ryan brought to him and requests Ryan travel to Yuma and bring back the men responsible for his son's death, along with Sidler. He also states he will be keeping Krysty, Mildred, and Dean in the ville. Should Ryan be successful in his task he says he will let everyone leave freely; should Ryan refuse the request or fail to execute it he will keep the women and child as his new family and have the rest executed. Ryan reluctantly agrees. Elsewhere, Abe has traveled to see a Native American \\"seer\\", hoping she can help him track down the Trader. The woman is able to tell him that the Trader is far to the West, but also warns that three of Abe's friends - whose descriptions match Ryan, Krysty, and J. B. - are in grave danger. The companions, minus Krysty, Mildred, and Dean, head North for Yuma, encountering a traveling group of actors along the way. When the actors reveal they are heading to Yuma the companions quickly offer to join with them, pretending that they have at least minimal acting experience. The ruse is seen through by the group's female performer, Ellie Morte, but she allows them to join anyway once Ryan assures her their purpose is not nefarious. Attached to the troupe, the companions enter Yuma virtually unchallenged. Once in the ville J. B. begins to take scrupulous measures to ensure his face is never fully seen by anyone other than the group. Ryan suspects his behavior may have something to do with one of their targets, a man Nelson identified as \\"Jennison\\", but when pressed J. B. refuses to discuss the matter; he assures Ryan he will let him know the details once he is certain they are necessary to know, but that the issue is not important right now. Ryan has little trouble locating his targets; he is almost immediately told to meet with Sidler at the ville's restored movie theater, and seated with the Baron are five of the six targets (the sixth is revealed to have died some months earlier). Following that meeting the companions begin to plan how they are going to capture Sidler and his group. The plan begins to take shape when Ryan learns that the play the troupe intends to perform includes a brief scene requiring audience participation. Because of the risks involved otherwise, the companions inform the troupe of their plans; the actors hesitantly agree to go along with the plot. Wizard Sidler does not attend the play initially, claiming sickness, which delays the kidnapping and brings Ryan and his friends close to missing Baron Nelson's deadline. Finally word comes that Sidler will be attending, delivered in person by Sidler's associate Jim Jennison. J. B., still taking measures to obscure his face, is able to confirm his suspicions, and once Jennison leaves he shares them with the group: Jennison is his half-brother. He still emphatically supports the plan to kidnap Sidler and his men, particularly since his half-brother's purported misdeeds do not come as a surprise to him. That night the group pulls off the plan successfully, and narrowly makes it out of Yuma before the ville's sec men realize what has happened. Back in Vista, Baron Nelson has been spending ample time with Dean, clearly using him as a surrogate for his deceased son but otherwise treating him nicely, even indulgently. It is only when the Baron's mother calls the three to a private audience with her that they realize the truth: the Baron does not intend to honor his agreement even if Ryan succeeds, and plans to kill the rest of the group on their return. Dean kills the woman while she tries to hold the three at gunpoint, and Krysty uses the dead woman's pistol to kill Alferd when he arrives and confronts them. Rick Coburn learns of what transpired, but decides not to do anything until the rest of the group's return. During the trip back to Vista, Sidler manages to break free of his bindings and kills Ellie before he in turn is killed by Doc. The woman's death comes as a particular loss to Tanner, who had recently started a sexual relationship with her. Sometime later the wagon carrying the remaining captives is driven off the edge of the road amid a harsh snowstorm, sending it to the bottom of a craggy ravine. The captives arm themselves and escape, but are quickly killed by J. B. and Ryan. The last captive standing is Jennison, who demands J. B. let him go free; J. B. refuses, and shoots his half-brother dead. The companions then use the ruins of the wagon as a makeshift pyre for the members of the acting troupe, all killed during the escape. By the time Ryan and his friends return to Vista, Rick Coburn has appointed himself Baron of the ville. Though he cannot simply let the companions go, owing to their direct involvement in the death of the previous Baron, Coburn gives them a two-hour head start after leaving the ville before he and his sec men come after them. The companions are able to make it to the redoubt with Coburn still trailing behind, but nearing. Ryan enters the standard door activation code, but the heavy metal blast door fails to open. After another failed attempt he curses as he realizes the door is not functional, and he and his friends now have nowhere to flee to as Rick Coburn and his armed posse nears.

The property was purchased by the War Department during World War II as a location for the production of TNT. Most of the LOOW property was sold after the war. The United States Department of Energy currently owns of the original LOOW property, on which the Niagara Falls Storage Site (NFSS) is located. The NFSS is used for the storage of radioactive materials produced during the development of America's first atom bombs. Approximately 93 percent of the original LOOW site--currently occupied by homes, a school, a campground, the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, farms, local and federal government operations, and a toxic waste facility--meets the criteria of a Formerly Used Defense Site, and one portion of the property is listed as a Superfund cleanup site. History Dormitories at the LOOW, 1943 The War Department purchased of farmland east of Youngstown, New York, in 1941 as a location to manufacture TNT. The location was selected because of its proximity to chemical manufacturing plants, to Fort Niagara, to the New York Central Railroad, and to water and electrical power. The LOOW headquarters were at first located in a vegetable canning factory at the site. The 149 private landowners living there--mostly farmers and orchard growers--were given 30 days to move out, and most of their 125 farmhouses and 538 barns were torn down or burned. Some homes located on the periphery of the LOOW boundary were kept. Construction of the TNT plant began in January 1941, and employed over 7,500 workers. The production and storage areas occupied approximately near the center of property, and the remaining was undeveloped and used as a \\"buffer zone\\". A hospital, dormitories, fire department, power plant, USO hall, water supply system, and waste treatment facility were located at the LOOW, and TNT was manufactured for about 9 months, until the plant was decommissioned in 1943. Uranium used to produce the first atom bombs from 1942 to 1948 was processed by Linde Air Products in nearby Tonawanda, and in 1944, the Manhattan Engineer District began using the LOOW site for the storage and transshipment of radioactive residues and wastes created through the processing of uranium ore at Linde. The War Assets Administration had by 1948 sold or transferred of the original property, and the remaining were given to the newly formed Atomic Energy Commission. More than were sold or transferred between 1955 and 1975, although the area on which the Niagara Falls Storage Site is located remained in the possession of the U.S. government. Buildings and operations =Building 401= Building 401 prior to demolition in 2010. The three silos were built to resemble a barn from the air. Beginning in 1943, Building 401 was used as the powerhouse for the production of TNT, though operations lasted less than a year. Building 401 was renovated, and from 1953‚Äì59 and 1965‚Äì71, it was used as a Boron-10 isotope separation plant. The interior of Building 401 was gutted in 1971, and its hardware and instrumentation were disposed of. Building 401 was demolished in 2010. =Concrete silo= Looking west, 1941. The concrete silo is in the center of the photograph. A concrete silo was erected within the east boundary of the LOOW, immediately next to Porter Center Road, which was publicly accessible. A fence with signs warning of \\"radioactive material\\" ran next to the road. In 1952, drums containing of highly-radioactive K-65 residues were loaded into the silo. The concrete silo was dismantled sometime after 1979. =Interim waste containment structure= Looking east, 2002. From foreground to background are the interim waste containment structure, the former Building 401, and the Modern Disposal Residential landfill. Construction of the interim waste containment structure was completed in 1991, and is located entirely within the Niagara Falls Storage Site. The mound is used for the storage of radioactive waste and residues, and the grass-covered \\"interim cap\\" is designed to retard both rainwater infiltration and radon emission. All of the contaminated and radioactive materials stored at the former LOOW site-- including thorium, uranium, and the world's largest concentration of radium-226--were placed into the structure. =Rochester Burial Site= In 1951, laboratory waste and animals that had been injected with plutonium during experiments at the University of Rochester were shipped to the LOOW site for burial. =US Army operations= The United States Army was given an parcel of land from the original LOOW property, located on the northeast boundary. Beginning in 1957 it housed 36 Nike surface-to-air missiles intended to protect the nearby Niagara Hydroelectric Power Project. The property is currently licensed to the New York Army National Guard, and is used as a weekend training site. =US Air Force operations= A parcel of land from the original LOOW property was given to the United States Air Force, on which they located an experimental rocket fuel plant called the Youngstown Test Annex Site. =Private waste treatment facilities= * Hooker Chemical Company purchased a large portion of the original LOOW property from a private landowner in 1975 to use as a dump site. * Waste Management, Inc currently owns and operates a treatment, storage, disposal, and recovery facility near the center of the former LOOW property. It is the only hazardous waste landfill remaining in the Northeastern United States, and was the location where the anthrax-contaminated desk of news-anchor Tom Brokaw was disposed of in 2001. * Modern Disposal Services operates a landfill on the former LOOW property. =Other uses= Approximately 380 private residences and a mobile home park are located within the footprint of the former LOOW site. A school, several small farms, a campground, and the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which attracts thousands of visitors annually, are also located in the former LOOW site. Safety concerns In 1981, the New York State Assembly Task Force on Toxic Substances wrote that the LOOW was \\"born in the crisis of war\\", and that: The report added that radioactive waste had been stored \\"in rusting barrels stacked along the roadside\\". Author Ginger Strand wrote about the LOOW in her 2008 book Inventing Niagara: \\"the Army Corps engineers, currently charged with the cleanup, readily admit they don't know everything that went on there\\". An extensive study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers concluded in 2014 that there was \\"no evidence of potential source areas or releases of contamination to groundwater, surface water, or soil associated with any of the ground disturbances evaluated\\" at the former LOOW site. Currently, approximately or 93 percent of the original LOOW site meets the criteria of a Formerly Used Defense Site, making it eligible for environmental restoration funds available from the U.S. Army. One portion of the property containing contaminated groundwater is listed as a Superfund cleanup site. A 2005 article in the Niagara Gazette alleged that radiation at the site was causing an ongoing hazard for the nearby Lewiston- Porter Central School District.

Trivulzio Portrait (1476), Antonello da Messina. The Turin City Museum of Ancient Art (Italian: Museo civico d'arte antica) is a museum located in the Palazzo Madama palace, in Turin, Italy. The museum has a renowned collection of paintings from the medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods. It reopened in 2006 after several years of restorations. History The museum was founded in 1934, as the heir of the Pinacoteca Regia and the Galleria Reale, which had been established in Palazzo Madama by king Charles Albert of Savoy in 1832. A Civic Museum had been founded in 1860 in the wake of the unification of Italy although, three years later, the collections were moved to another location in Turin, in Via Gaudenzio Ferrari. These were increased gradually with acquisitions from private collectors, from closed House of Savoy residences or from donations by the same family. In 1898 the collections of ancient art were separated from modern ones. The former were moved to the current location in 1934 by will of director Vittorio Viale. Its collection of Asian art, including rare artifacts from Gandhara, coming from the Italian excavations of the IsMEO at the Butkara Stupa in Pakistan, was transferred to Turin's Museum of Oriental Art in 2008. Description The museum includes a total of 35 rooms on four floors. The underground floor houses is dedicated to medieval works, the first floor to Gothic and Renaissance painting, the second floor to Baroque works, while the upper floor deals with decorations. Madonna and Child Enthroned with Four Angels (1475‚Äì80) by Giovanni Martino Spanzotti. Aside from paintings and sculptures, works exhibited include also illuminated codexes (such as the Turin-Milan Hours), ceramics, porcelains, majolica and ivories (mostly of oriental origin), gold and silver works, as well as a furniture and cloths. The 15th century Torre dei Tesori (\\"Tower of the Treasures\\") is home to several of the museum most known works: Antonello da Messina's Trivulzio Portrait, the Turin-Milan Hours and several objects from Charles Emmanuel I's cabinet. Other works include a series of sculptures of \\"Dead Christ\\", paintings by Macrino d'Alba, Giacomo Jaquerio, Giovanni Martino Spanzotti, Defendente Ferrari, Antonio Vivarini, Giulio Campi, Gaudenzio Ferrari, Gandolfino da Roreto, Gerolamo Giovenone, Francesco Hayez, sculptures and goldsmith works from the 8th-13th centuries, Piedmontese coats of arms. The Camera delle Guardie (\\"Guards Chambers\\") houses Baroque paintings by artists such as Orazio Gentileschi (Assumption and St. Jerome), Giovanni Battista Crespi, Giulio Cesare Procaccini and Francesco Cairo.

The stone structure is built round a natural hot spring and on a lintel there is an inscription thought to be the Hebrew word zochalim, \\"flowing\\". This led to the theory that this was a mikveh or Jewish ritual bath. The interpretation of the inscription was challenged in 2002 and the alternative theory proposed that the bath is too deep for a mikvah and may have been used to cleanse bodies before burial in the nearby Jewish cemetery at Brandon Hill which was established after 1177. A Jewish community was known to exist in Bristol from at least 1154 until the wholesale banishment of the Jewish community from England in 1290. The spring became the property of St Augustine's Abbey in 1142 and the exterior was rebuilt in the 18th or 19th century. A Royal Commission on the Health of Towns reported in 1845 that nearly all of the water laid into Bristol came from Jacob's Wells. The Commission noted that the water, which also fed the Cathedral and the Grammar School, was of good quality but the volume was not enough to supply the city. In 1905 the natural hot spring was diverted into the Jacob Wells Baths. Jacob's Well was rediscovered in 1987 by the Bristol Temple Local History Group, who were investigating the site during the rebuilding of a furniture workshop which had been the Hotwells Police Station bicycle shed, and a one-time fire engine house. In February 2011, the company that now owns the well applied to the Environment Agency to extract and bottle up to 15 million litres (3.3 million imperial gallons) of water a year. Water from the well was previously bottled and sold in the 1980s. See also For other similarly named structures, see Jacob's Well. References and sources ;References ;Sources * J. Hillaby and R.

Early life Augustus Theodore Harman Alt was born to father Jost Heinrich (anglicised to Just Henry), a Hessian, and mother Jeannetta Preston, a Scotswoman, probably in London, but possibly overseas, in 1731. Just Henry entered the service of the Landgrave in Sweden as Writer to Major General Ernst Hartmann von Diemar, with whom he moved to London in 1725 as Registrar. Henry successively became Secretary, Private Secretary, Counsellor, Minister, and, 1760, Privy Counsellor, until his death in 1768. In later life he assumed the title \\"Baron of Hesse-Kassel,\\" though its provenance is unclear as the title \\"Baron\\" was never awarded by the German Emperor. Nonetheless, a grant of arms was later awarded to the family by the British monarch. Augustus was the third eldest of at least seven children, four boys and three girls, and possibly nine if another reported brother and sister are included. Career By 1755 Augustus was Ensign in the 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot. In 1757 as Lieutenant he accompanied Sir John Mordaunt's expedition to Rochefort, France. From 1760 during the Seven Years' War he served as aide-de-camp to General Henry Seymour Conway, and appears to have liaised with Prince Ferdinand. He ended up at the siege of Kassel in 1762, returning with the regiment in 1763, thereafter assisting it to build roads in Scotland until 1764. During late 1777 he helped raise the 72nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Manchester Volunteers) and served with that regiment at the Great Siege of Gibraltar, being appointed assistant Engineer there by Governor George Eliott in 1779. In 1781, he joined Colonel James Francis Erskine in trying to raise a battalion of Swiss Chasseurs for service with the East India Company. The venture was stopped by the Swiss authorities with Augustus and fellow officers being jailed for several months. In 1785, he was engineer for another thwarted venture with Erskine to assist the Polish adventurer Count Maurice Benyovszky found a settlement in Madagascar. =Surveyor General of New South Wales= In May 1787, Alt was appointed Surveyor of Lands for Britain's proposed penal colony on the newly claimed Australian continent. Later that year he embarked aboard the convict transport Prince of Wales with the First Fleet under Commodore Arthur Phillip. They arrived at Botany Bay in mid-January 1788 and shortly after moved to Port Jackson, landing on 26 January 1788. On arrival, Alt supervised the Fleet convicts in clearing the ground for the establishment of the first colonial buildings in Sydney Cove.Cowell and Best 1989, pp. 20-22 Soon after his arrival in New South Wales Augustus laid out the settlements of Albion (later Sydney), Parramatta and Tongabby (later Toongabbie), as well as surveying early land-grants and compiling the records of these. Ill health incapacitated him early on and he had asked to be relieved in 1791, although he did not retire from active duty until 1797. He was officially relieved on half-pay in 1802 and succeeded by his deputy, surveyor Charles Grimes. At first, in his official capacity as he lived in the town of Sydney, then for many years afterwards on a large land grant, 'Hermitage Farm', at Ashfield about seven miles west (and now an inner western suburb). It is said that he moved to Parramatta c1810, or a little later. He died there on 9 January 1815. He had two children, Lucy and Henry, by convict Ann George but never married her. Ann died in 1814. Lucy died as a teenager in 1806. Henry, aged 17, left the colony at the end of 1815 on the ship Northampton bound for China, but nothing further is known of him. Augustus is buried at the Anglican St. John's graveyard, Parramatta, with a table monument giving full, if slightly incorrect, biographical details set down later by his nephew Matthew Bowles Alt, son of Just Alt, long-time rector at Mixbury, Oxon.

The doctor‚Äìpatient relationship forms one of the foundations of contemporary medical ethics. Importance A medical officer explains an x-ray to the patient. The doctor is providing medical advice to this patient. A physician performs a standard physical examination on his patient. A patient must have confidence in the competence of their physician and must feel that they can confide in him or her. For most physicians, the establishment of good rapport with a patient is important. Some medical specialties, such as psychiatry and family medicine, emphasize the physician‚Äìpatient relationship more than others, such as pathology or radiology, which have very little contact with patients. The quality of the patient‚Äìphysician relationship is important to both parties. The doctor and patient's values and perspectives about disease, life, and time available play a role in building up this relationship. A strong relationship between the doctor and patient will lead to frequent, quality information about the patient's disease and better health care for the patient and their family. Enhancing the accuracy of the diagnosis and increasing the patient's knowledge about the disease all come with a good relationship between the doctor and the patient. Where such a relationship is poor the physician's ability to make a full assessment is compromised and the patient is more likely to distrust the diagnosis and proposed treatment, causing decreased compliance to actually follow the medical advice which results in bad health outcomes. In these circumstances and also in cases where there is genuine divergence of medical opinions, a second opinion from another physician may be sought or the patient may choose to go to another physician that they trust more. Additionally, the benefits of any placebo effect are also based upon the patient's subjective assessment (conscious or unconscious) of the physician's credibility and skills. Michael and Enid Balint together pioneered the study of the physician patient relationship in the UK. Michael Balint's \\"The Doctor, His Patient and the Illness\\" (1957) outlined several case histories in detail and became a seminal text. Their work is continued by the Balint Society, The International Balint Federation and other national Balint societies in other countries. It is one of the most influential works on the topic of doctor-patient relationships. In addition, a Canadian physician known as Sir William Osler was known as one of the \\"Big Four\\" professors at the time that the Johns Hopkins Hospital was first founded. At the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Osler had invented the world's first medical residency system. In terms of efficacy (i.e. the outcome of treatment), the doctor‚Äìpatient relationship seems to have a \\"small, but statistically significant impact on healthcare outcomes\\". However, due to a relatively small sample size and a minimally effective test, researchers concluded additional research on this topic is necessary. Recognizing that patients receive the best care when they work in partnership with doctors, the UK General Medical Council issued guidance for both of doctors named \\"Ethical guidance for doctors\\" and for patients \\"What to expect from your doctor\\" in April 2013 Aspects of relationship The following aspects of the doctor‚Äìpatient relationship are the subject of commentary and discussion. =Informed consent= The default medical practice for showing respect to patients and their families is for the doctor to be truthful in informing the patient of their health and to be direct in asking for the patient's consent before giving treatment. Historically in many cultures there has been a shift from paternalism, the view that the \\"doctor always knows best,\\" to the idea that patients must have a choice in the provision of their care and be given the right to provide informed consent to medical procedures. There can be issues with how to handle informed consent in a doctor‚Äìpatient relationship; for instance, with patients who do not want to know the truth about their condition. Furthermore, there are ethical concerns regarding the use of placebo. Does giving a sugar pill lead to an undermining of trust between doctor and patient? Is deceiving a patient for his or her own good compatible with a respectful and consent-based doctor‚Äìpatient relationship? These types of questions come up frequently in the healthcare system and the answers to all of these questions are usually far from clear but should be informed by medical ethics. =Shared decision making= Health advocacy messages such as this one encourage patients to talk with their doctors about their healthcare. Shared decision making is the idea that as a patient gives informed consent to treatment, that patient also is given an opportunity to choose among the treatment options provided by the physician that is responsible for their healthcare. This means the doctor does not recommend what the patient should do, rather the patient's autonomy is respected and they choose what medical treatment they want to have done. A practice which is an alternative to this is for the doctor to make a person's health decisions without considering that person's treatment goals or having that person's input into the decision-making process is grossly unethical and against the idea of personal autonomy and freedom. The spectrum of a physician's inclusion of a patient into treatment decisions is well represented in Ulrich Beck's World at Risk. At one end of this spectrum is Beck's Negotiated Approach to risk communication, in which the communicator maintains an open dialogue with the patient and settles on a compromise on which both patient and physician agree. A majority of physicians employ a variation of this communication model to some degree, as it is only with this technique that a doctor can maintain the open cooperation of his or her patient. At the opposite end of this spectrum is the Technocratic Approach to risk communication, in which the physician exerts authoritarian control over the patient's treatment and pushes the patient to accept the treatment plan with which they are presented in a paternalistic manner. This communication model places the physician in a position of omniscience and omnipotence over the patient and leaves little room for patient contribution to a treatment plan. =Physician superiority= The physician may be viewed as superior to the patient simply because physicians tend to use big words and concepts to put him or herself in a position above the patient. The physician‚Äìpatient relationship is also complicated by the patient's suffering (patient derives from the Latin patior, \\"suffer\\") and limited ability to relieve it on his or her own, potentially resulting in a state of desperation and dependency on the physician. A physician should be aware of these disparities in order to establish a good rapport and optimize communication with the patient. Additionally, having a clear perception of these disparities can go a long way to helping the patient in the future treatment. It may be further beneficial for the doctor‚Äìpatient relationship to have a form of shared care with patient empowerment to take a major degree of responsibility for her or his care. Those who go to a doctor typically do not know exact medical reasons of why they are there, which is why they go to a doctor in the first place. For a patient to not be able to understand what is going on with their body, because they cannot understand lab results or their doctor is not sharing or explaining them, can be a frightening and frustrating situation to be in. An in depth discussion of lab results and the certainty that the patient can understand them may lead to the patient feeling reassured, and with that may bring positive outcomes in the physician-patient relationship. =Physician bias= Physicians have a tendency of overestimating their communication skills, as well as the amount of information they provide their patients. Extensive research conducted on 700 orthopedic surgeons and 807 patients, for instance, found that 75% of the surgeons perceived they satisfactorily communicated with their patients, whereas only 21% of the patients were actually satisfied with their communication. Physicians also show a high likelihood of underestimating their patients' information needs and desires, especially for patients who were not college educated or from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. There is pervasive evidence that patients' personal attributes such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status may influence how informative physicians are with their patients. Patients who are better educated and from upper or upper middle- class positions generally receive higher quality and quantity of information from physicians than do those toward the other end of the social spectrum, although both sides have an equal desire for information. Race, ethnicity and language has consistently proven to have a significant impact on how physicians perceive and interact with patients. According to a study of 618 medical encounters between mainly Caucasian physicians and Caucasian and African American patients, physicians perceived African Americans to be less intelligent and educated, less likely to be interested in an active lifestyle, and more likely to have substance abuse problems than Caucasians. Studies in Los Angeles emergency departments have found that Hispanic males and African Americans were less than half likely to receive pain medication than Caucasians, despite physicians' estimates that patients were experiencing an equivalent level of pain. Other studies show that physicians exhibited substantially less rapport building and empathetic behavior with Hispanic patients than Caucasians, despite the absence of language barriers. =Benefiting or pleasing= A dilemma may arise in situations where determining the most efficient treatment, or encountering avoidance of treatment, creates a disagreement between the physician and the patient, for any number of reasons. In such cases, the physician needs strategies for presenting unfavorable treatment options or unwelcome information in a way that minimizes strain on the doctor‚Äìpatient relationship while benefiting the patient's overall physical health and best interests. When the patient either can not or will not do what the physician knows is the correct course of treatment, the patient becomes non-adherent. Adherence management coaching becomes necessary to provide positive reinforcement of unpleasant options. For example, according to a Scottish study, patients want to be addressed by their first name more often than is currently the case. In this study, most of the patients either liked (223) or did not mind (175) being called by their first names. Only 77 individuals disliked being called by their first name, most of whom were aged over 65. On the other hand, most patients do not want to call the doctor by his or her first name. Some familiarity with the doctor generally makes it easier for patients to talk about intimate issues such as sexual subjects, but for some patients, a very high degree of familiarity may make the patient reluctant to reveal such intimate issues. =Transitional care= Transitions of patients between health care practitioners may decrease the quality of care in the time it takes to reestablish proper doctor‚Äìpatient relationships. Generally, the doctor‚Äìpatient relationship is facilitated by continuity of care in regard to attending personnel. Special strategies of integrated care may be required where multiple health care providers are involved, including horizontal integration (linking similar levels of care, e.g. multiprofessional teams) and vertical integration (linking different levels of care, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary care).Gr√∂ne, O & Garcia- Barbero, M (2002): Trends in Integrated Care ‚Äì Reflections on Conceptual Issues. World Health Organization, Copenhagen, 2002, EUR/02/5037864 = Turn- taking and conversational dominance = The process of turn-taking between health care professionals and the patients has a profound impact on the relationship between them. In most scenarios, a doctor will walk into the room in which the patient is being held and will ask a variety of questions involving the patient's history, examination, and diagnosis. These are often the foundation of the relationship between the doctor and the patient as this interaction tends to be the first they have together. This can go a long way into impacting the future of the relationship throughout the patient's care. All speech acts between individuals seek to accomplish the same goal, sharing and exchanging information and meeting each participants conversational goals. Research carried out in medical scenarios analyzed 188 situations in which an interruption occurred between a physician and a patient. Of these 188 analyzed situations, research found that the doctor is much more likely (67% of the time, 126 occasions) as compared to the patient (33% of the time, 62 occasions). This shows that physicians are practicing a form of conversational dominance in which they see themselves as far superior to the patient in terms of importance and knowledge and therefore dominate all aspects of the conversation. A question that comes to mind considering this is if interruptions hinder or improve the condition of the patient. Constant interruptions from the patient whilst the doctor is discussing treatment options and diagnoses can be detrimental or lead to less effective efforts in patient treatment. This is extremely important to take note of as it is something that can be addressed in quite a simple manner. This research conducted on doctor-patient interruptions also indicates that males are much more likely to interject out of turn in a conversation than women. Men's social predisposition to interject becomes problematic when it negatively impacts a woman physician's messages to her patients who are men: she may not be able to finish her statements and the patient will not benefit from what she was about to say, and the physician herself may fall prey to the socially conventional man's interjection by letting it cut short her professional commentary. Conversely, men physicians need to encourage women patients to articulate their reactions and questions, since women interrupt in conversations statistically less often than men do. =Other involved individuals= An example of where other people present in a doctor‚Äìpatient encounter may influence their communication is one or more parents present at a minor's visit to a doctor. These may provide psychological support for the patient, but in some cases it may compromise the doctor‚Äìpatient confidentiality and inhibit the patient from disclosing uncomfortable or intimate subjects. When visiting a health provider about sexual issues, having both partners of a couple present is often necessary, and is typically a good thing, but may also prevent the disclosure of certain subjects, and, according to one report, increases the stress level. Having family around when dealing with difficult medical circumstances or treatments can also lead to complications. Family members, in addition to the patient needing treatment may disagree on the treatment needing to be done. This can lead to tension and discomfort for the patient and the doctor, putting further strain on the relationship. Bedside manner The medical doctor, with a nurse by his side, is performing a blood test at a hospital in 1980. *A good bedside manner is typically one that reassures and comforts the patient while remaining honest about a diagnosis. * Vocal tones, body language, openness, presence, honesty, and concealment of attitude may all affect bedside manner. * Poor bedside manner leaves the patient feeling unsatisfied, worried, frightened, or alone. * Bedside manner becomes difficult when a healthcare professional must explain an unfavorable diagnosis to the patient, while keeping the patient from being alarmed. Dr. Rita Charon launched the narrative medicine movement in 2001 with an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In the article she claimed that better understanding the patient's narrative could lead to better medical care. Researchers and Ph.D.s in a BMC Medical Education journal conducted a recent study that resulted in five key conclusions about the needs of patients from their health care providers. First, patients want their providers to provide reassurance. Second, patients feel anxious asking their providers questions; they want their providers to tell them it is ok to ask questions. Third, patients want to see their lab results and for the doctor to explain what they mean. Fourth, patients simply do not want to feel judged by their providers. And fifth, patients want to be participants in medical decision-making; they want providers to ask them what they want. An example of how body language affects patient perception of care is that the time spent with the patient in the emergency department is perceived as longer if the doctor sits down during the encounter.Simple Tips to Improve Patient Satisfaction By Michael Pulia. American Academy of Emergency Medicine. 2011;18(1):18‚Äì19. =Examples in fiction= * Dr. Gregory House (of the show House) has an acerbic, insensitive bedside manner. However, this is an extension of his normal personality. * In Grey's Anatomy, Dr. Burke compliments Dr. George O'Malley's ability to care for Dr. Bailey's baby by saying \\"it speaks to a good bedside manner.\\" * Doc Martin from the Doc Martin British TV series is a good example of a physician with a bad bedside manner. * Dr Lily Chao from the British TV series Casualty is another example of a Foundation Doctor with a poor bedside manner, whereas her colleague, Dr Ethan Hardy has a better one. * In Lost, Hurley tells Jack Shephard that his bedside manner \\"sucks\\". Later in the episode, Jack is told by his father to put more hope into his sayings, which he does when operating on his future wife. The comments continue in other episodes of the series with Benjamin Linus sarcastically telling Jack that his \\"bedside manner leaves something to be desired\\" after Jack gives him a harsh negative diagnosis. * In Closer, Larry, the physician tells Anna when they first meet that he is famed for his bedside manner. * In Scrubs, J.D is presented as an example of a physician with great bedside manner, while Elliot Reid is a physician with bad or non-existent bedside manner at first, until she evolves during her tenure at Sacred Heart. Dr. Cox is an interesting subversion, in that his manner is brash and undiplomatic while still inspiring patients to do their own best to aid in the healing process, akin to a drill sergeant. This show also comically remarked that the most time that a doctor needs to be in the presence of the patient before he finds out everything he needs to know is approximately 15 seconds. * In Star Trek: Voyager, the Doctor often compliments himself on the charming bedside manner he developed with the help of Kes. * In M*A*S*H, Hawkeye Pierce, Trapper John McIntyre, B.J. Hunnicutt, and Sherman Potter all possess a caring and humorous bedside manner meant to help patients cope with traumatic injuries. Charles Winchester initially possesses no real bedside manner, acting with detached professionalism, until the rigors of his job help him develop a sense of compassion for his patients. Frank Burns has a poor bedside manner, constantly minimizing the seriousness of his patients' injuries, accusing them of cowardice and goading them to return to the front lines. Patient behavior The behavior of the patient affects the doctor‚Äìpatient relationship. Rude or aggressive behavior from patients or their family members can also distract healthcare professionals and cause them to be less effective or to make mistakes during a medical procedure. When dealing with situations in any healthcare setting, there is stress on the medical staff to do their job effectively. Whilst many factors can affect how their job gets done, rude patients and unappealing attitudes can play a big role. Research carried out by Dr. Pete Hamburger, associate dean for research at Tel Aviv University, evidences this fact. His research showed that rude and harsh attitudes shown toward the medical staff reduced their ability to effectively carry out some of their simpler and more procedural tasks. This is important because if the medical staff are not performing sufficiently in what should be simple tasks, their ability to work effectively in critical conditions will also be impaired. While it is completely understandable that patients are going through an extremely tough time compounded by stress from other external and internal factors, it is important for the doctors and medical staff to be wary of the rude attitudes that may come their way.

It starred (the then relatively unknown) Gaminda Priyaviraj and Suneth Chithrananda as the characters Podi Malli and Chooti Malli. Both names connote younger brother. However, chooti usually has more emphasis, so Chooti Malli is probably to be considered the younger of the two characters. Api Nodanna Live started in 2003 and lasted up to early 2004. It was a hit at that time with the leading presenters of Podi Malli and Chooty Malli, and was supported by characters Sudu Malli and Jaya Sri. The sequel, Api Nodanna Live season 2, was broadcast on 18 February 2008. Since the second season commenced bit later than the first season, it starred with women presenters, Podi Nangi and Chooti Nangi. It was directed by Gaminda Priyaviraj, and written by both Priyaviraj and Chithrananda. The show became the most popular on Sri Lanka at that time. The abbreviation for the show, \\"ala\\", means potato in the Sinhala language, a word which is also used to imply \\"failure\\" in a comic sense. The two presenters became famous through the show and became the two main players in Sri Lankan television comedy.

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot synopsis Picking up directly from the events at the end of Shockscape, Ryan Cawdor, his son Dean, Krysty Wroth, J.B. Dix, Dr. Theophilus Tanner, Mildred Wyeth, and Michael Brother find themselves trapped at the exterior entrance of a redoubt somewhere south of Yuma, Colorado. The group is being pursued by a posse headed by Rick Coburn, sec boss of the nearby ville of Vista, intent on killing them for the death of the ville's Baron. Safety lies within the redoubt, but the exterior keypad which operates the redoubt's main doors is not functioning. Ryan makes the decision to scale the mountain the redoubt is built into, with the intent of reaching a section of corridor which has been opened to the elements following an earthquake. Ryan scales the steep mountain and makes it inside, taking more than a half-hour to recover from the subzero climb. He then makes his way into the redoubt, carefully moving past a hive of mutated albino worms, previously shown to be carnivorous and capable of burrowing through solid concrete. At this point he is attacked by Coburn, who has followed Ryan's ascent into the redoubt. The two spar hand-to-hand, finding themselves evenly matched. When Coburn pulls a gun (shortly before Ryan was going to pull a knife) the noise rouses the nearby mutant worms, who swarm Coburn and devour him alive. Ryan opens the entrance door and lets his friends into the redoubt; the companions then make a jump in the redoubt's MAT-TRANS chamber. The jump takes them to a somewhat damaged redoubt, which all describe as being unnaturally humid. The reason for this is soon discovered: the bulk of the facility appears to have become submerged, leaving only the MAT-TRANS facility above water. The companions exit through a partially submerged, open tunnel, finding themselves on a chain of islands; using his sextant, J.B. places them on the Florida Keys. The group is alarmed to discover that Michael, who earlier revealed that he cannot swim, has not surfaced. They briefly search for him, only to find him when a gigantic sea serpent emerges from the bay, clutching Michael. Inexplicably, Michael is rescued when a large group of dolphins appear and swarm the serpent, causing it to drop him and scaring it off. Michael is shaken, but okay. The companions venture south, and eventually come across a seemingly intact facility identified as the Mark Tomwun Institute of Peaceful Oceanographic Research. The group soon learn from the facility's eponymous leader that the dolphins which rescued Michael came from the Institute, and furthermore are startled to learn that one of the Institute's members, Miranda, is able to speak with the dolphins directly. Tomwun offers the companions hospitality and a place to stay, which they accept. Several days pass, and the Institute seems perfect: peaceful, safe, with ample food and comfortable lodging. Some of the companions, particularly Ryan and J.B., are nonetheless suspicious, but initially have no evidence to base their suspicions on. This changes on an evening when Ryan is attacked by a Seminole Indian, mistaking him for a member of the Institute. Later on an Institute trip to observe ocean phenomena, Ryan is tipped overboard by an undersea volcanic eruption, and washes ashore a large distance from the rest of the group. On his trek back to the Institute he comes across a shipwrecked Seminole vessel, its hull breached by explosives and its merchant crew slaughtered. Ryan confronts Tomwun with these pieces of information, at gunpoint, upon his return. Tomwun confesses that the boat was indeed sunk by the Institute, or rather their trained dolphins carrying explosives. He assures Ryan that the sinking was a mistake, and the intended target was the man who he asserts slaughtered the crew: Red Jack Yoville, leader of a large band of pirates. Yoville has been capturing and pillaging settlements in the area, and Tomwun feared the Institute would be next. Disgusted with Tomwun's tactics and relative apathy over the deaths of the Seminole merchants, Ryan still agrees to spare his life and the lives of the Institute's other occupants; the companions leave for the redoubt the next morning. On the way they come across an encampment of pirates, and when surprised by a pirate returning from urinating have no choice but to open fire on the encampment. The companions survive without injury, but are unable to prevent some of the pirates from escaping, presumably to warn the rest of their group. The companions reason that the pirates will likely set up ambushes further north, and reluctantly head back to the Institute. Meanwhile, Abe has been following the Trader towards the west coast, hearing repeated tales of a man matching the Trader's description. After spending several days holed up against a snowstorm Abe comes across a wandering hunter, who tells him he has a letter for Abe from the Trader. The note recounts several events in Abe's immediate past, including a fight with a mutated bobcat, and ends telling Abe that the Trader is trying to leave his old life behind, but will still be happy to see Abe if he catches up with him. Back in Florida, Ryan and Tomwun come to an agreement: Ryan and his friends will stay for five days, during which time they will defend the Institute should the pirates attack. Scouting missions during the first four days reveal nothing, save for a peculiar race of mutants living in a near-immaculate Best Western hotel on a southern island. When Ryan and Krysty return from scouting the island, they learn that a group of eight pirates‚Äîa scouting party‚Äîattacked the Institute and were repelled. The next day Yoville himself arrives in a wag under a white flag of truce. Yoville tells Ryan that the two have met previously when Ryan was traveling with the Trader, and offers Ryan a deal: Ryan and his friends will leave unharmed while the pirates raid the Institute (and kill its inhabitants). Remembering his previous encounter with Yoville, specifically an ambush attempt by the pirate leader, Ryan refuses the offer, and shoots the two accompanying pirate commanders dead. Yoville retreats. The next day at dawn the pirates attack en masse, coming over land with war wags and armed men as well as by boat from the north and south. The group is prepared for the wags, and detonates a large gasoline incendiary device as they cross the bridge, disabling the wags and killing a large number of pirates. The companions struggle for a way to deal with the approaching boats, but have the problem taken care of when a sudden earthquake causes waves large enough to tip them over. Unfortunately the earthquake does not stop, evidently not a simple quake but something cataclysmic. Tomwun attempts to stop the group from leaving, only to be shot by Ryan. As the companions leave they watch a mortally wounded Tomwun fall into a newly opened fissure, and further fissures destroy the remains of the Institute. The companions quickly overtake the fleeing Yoville, and with his approach masked by the continuing earthquake Ryan gets close to the man and kills him. Ryan and his friends then use Yoville's single remaining vehicle to head for the redoubt. Though hampered by shifting, treacherous terrain, they make it to the facility. Before entering the still-submerged entrance the group notes the source of the earthquake: a visible and gigantic volcanic eruption roughly 50 miles from shore. Doc notes that the force has generated a massive tsunami headed their way; the group quickly swims into the redoubt, which is barely functioning. As Ryan closes the doors to the MAT-TRANS chamber the lights begin to dim, and he soon realizes something is wrong with the jump he has just initiated. Cultural references Characters in the novel reference several water-themed films, including Jaws (film) and Creature from the Black Lagoon, the latter being used to describe the mutants found inhabiting the isolated Best Western.

The airport underwent a major redevelopment completed in April 2012, replacing the original A.T. Berry Terminal with a larger, modern facility. Much of the $14 million project funded by energy and resources companies to support their operations in the area. History The airport opened in 1949, replacing an earlier facility which had been operating since the 1920s located across town, south of the railway line. The town was one of the first served by Qantas, who inaugurated weekly services between Brisbane, Roma and Charleville in April 1929. With the move to the new site, the services increased to every weekday. As there was no terminal facilities on the site, from the 1960s ground handling, check-in and bookings were conducted out of the back of a Ford Falcon utility by local man Alan Berry. On 27 April 1996 the mayor of Roma opened a new terminal facility, named the AT Berry Terminal in honour of Mr. Berry's dedication to aviation in the town. The airport and terminal facilities were extensively upgraded in 2012, with the construction of a new terminal (also named the AT Berry Terminal) and enlarged apron. Within months of opening in April, by December the new terminal was already operating close to capacity, handling more than 179,000 passengers in the 2012-13 financial year. In 2013-14 the airport handled more than 254,000 passengers, ranking Roma as the 29th busiest airport in Australia. This growth represented an increase of 42.1% on the previous year and was the strongest growth recorded for any regional airport in Australia. Much of this passenger traffic is generated from closed fly-in fly-out (FIFO) charters for the resources industry involved in coal seam gas energy projects in the Surat Basin. In October 2014, JETGO Australia announced direct jet services to Sydney to begin in November as one of two destinations to launch the airline's expansion into scheduled public transport flights. After delaying starting the route until December, on 20 November the company announced that due to slow bookings and the slowing of the local resources industry that they were cancelling the planned services. Airlines and destinations Accidents and incidents *On the evening of 28 September 1989, a Beechcraft Baron flying from Longreach to Roma failed to arrive at the airport. No distress call was received. A search and rescue operation located wreckage west of Roma, with the aircraft having descended into trees for unknown reasons. The five occupants were killed in the accident. *On 25 March 2013 a similar accident occurred killing former bull riding world champion John Quintana and the CEO of livestock brokerage firm Ray White Rural when the Cessna 210 aircraft they were travelling in crashed shortly after takeoff from Roma prior to first light without broadcasting a distress call.

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot synopsis Ryan Cawdor, his son Dean, Krysty Wroth, J.B. Dix, Dr. Theophilus Tanner, Mildred Wyeth, and Michael Brother begin a MAT-TRANS jump in a decaying redoubt, only for the jump to go awry part-way through. When they awake they each find themselves alone in a distinctly separate redoubt, with the exception of Dean and Krysty who were in close contact when the jump occurred. Individually they explore the outer control rooms of their respective redoubts, only to all decide (for varying reasons) to jump again; all decide to jump within the 30 minute \\"return window\\", which under normal circumstances will return them to the last facility they jumped from. Instead they are all sent to a different facility, presumably because their initial jump point has ceased to function. Though the companions are all sent to the same facility, their arrival is staggered in 20 minute increments. Ryan arrives first and proceeds through the facility, followed (unknowingly) by J.B. who in turn is followed (also unknowingly) by Mildred. Ryan discovers the top floor of the redoubt houses a massive wartime mortuary which has recently been invaded by hostile \\"cannies\\". Though of little relative threat, Ryan is nonetheless forced to open fire on an attacking group of cannies. J.B. immediately recognizes the sound of Ryan's blaster and rushes to his aid, with Mildred meeting up with the two soon after the firefight concludes. Meanwhile, Krysty and Dean have arrived at the redoubt and waited long enough to greet Michael as he jumps in. They proceed to the top floor and reunite with the rest of the group, unaware that Doc Tanner has arrived some time after them. Doc's mental stability has been temporarily impaired owing to the stress of his initial destination combined with back-to-back jumps, and in this state he mistakenly comes face-to-face with a large group of cannies. The ensuing battle draws his nearby friends to him, who help kill the remaining cannies and save Doc from certain death. Reunited, the companions explore the redoubt, finding several warehouse-sized rooms filled with innumerable refrigerated corpses, slowly being raided and used for food by the cannies. Doc refuses to let the corpses be used for food, locates the environmental control room, and increases the ambient temperature as far as the system will allow. The long-frozen bodies quickly begin to rot, and Ryan and his friends leave the facility as fast as possible. The area outside proves to be a hilly pine forest, which causes both Mildred and Doc to doubt J.B. when his sextant places them somewhere in Kansas; he asserts that he is correct. The argument is moot and the companions enjoy several hours of relative peace and favorable conditions. Sometime later a horse-mounted hunting party is spotted in the distance, causing the companions to hide. Initially suspecting it to be a deer hunt, the companions soon learn it is a manhunt. The fleeing man is caught a short distance from Ryan and his friends, then brutally executed at the order of a beautiful, raven-haired woman. Before the hunters can leave Dean falls from his hiding place, forcing Ryan and his friends to reveal themselves. The woman is introduced as Mistress Marie Mandeville, the daughter of the local Baron; she orders Ryan and his friends to accompany her back to the ville. Along the way Doc nearly drowns while crossing a raging river and is rescued by Ryan, but loses his LeMat Revolver in the process. Meanwhile in the ville of Andromeda, somewhere near the Cific Ocean, Abe is continuing his search for Trader. While at a bar he is set upon by three men, scavengers who mistakenly believe he has a map to a cache of pre-dark technology, and intend to interrogate him for the information. Though outnumbered and caught unprepared, he is saved when the three men are shot dead. His savior is none other than the Trader. Reunited, the two begin to travel together, and eventually start offering payment for any traveler willing to carry a message for either J.B. or Ryan, should they come across either. The message simply states that Abe has found the Trader, and the two will be near Seattle for the next three months. Back in Kansas, the Baron, Nathan Mandeville, greets the companions warmly and shows them great hospitality, offering them fine food and comfortable lodgings. Nonetheless there is a subtle undertone of something sinister in the Baron's attitude, further emphasized by veiled, ambiguous warnings from the ville's sec boss, Harry Guiteau, as well as the extreme security measures in place throughout the ville. The following day the companions are invited to participate in a series of public, competitive challenges, which they accept. The first challenge pits Michael against the ville's jailer, Jericho, in unarmed wrestling. Michael wins the first bout, only to be sucker-punched by Jericho as her readies for the next round. Angered, Michael crushes Jericho's larynx, then finishes him with a bone-breaking kick to the face. The death attracts the immediate attention of Mistress Marie, who appears to orgasm watching Michael kill the larger man. The remainder of the competition is spent with Michael seated by her side, the two touching intimately and at one point with Marie possibly giving Michael a handjob. At the end of the day's events Mistress Marie leaves for her quarters with Michael at her side. While the other companions eat dinner and, later, return to their rooms, Michael and Marie spend time alone in her room. Both are drunk, and in this state Marie mentions that she will keep Michael \\"safe\\"; Michael briefly realizes this implies his friends will not be safe. The two then proceed to have sex for several hours, with Mistress Marie variously biting him, performing fellatio, engaging in vaginal intercourse, having Michael perform cunnilingus on her, and ordering him to kiss her boots and suck her boot heels in order to \\"show you'll do what I tell you.\\" While this happens Marie plays a collection of custom vids, which start with relatively benign subjects such as bondage, group sex, and pegging, but move on to darker subjects such as bestiality, eventually culminating in a vid showing Mistress Marie disemboweling a pre- teen boy, to her both recorded and live sexual pleasure. Michael reacts by simultaneously punching Marie and vomiting in her face, and flees for his friends' rooms. After Michael tells his friends what he witnessed, the group makes an attempt to leave the ville, only to be stopped by a large contingent of sec men led by Marie. The companions are disarmed and escorted back to their rooms. The following day Ryan concludes they are going to be hunted for sport, which Marie confirms. The companions are given only their bladed weapons and a 15 minute start. Rather than hopelessly trying to reach the redoubt, Ryan and his friends circle around and re-enter the ville from the back just as the hunting party, consisting of most of the ville's sec men, leave from the front. The companions disable the ville's hydroelectric generator, then make their way into the Baron's armory to recover their weapons. In the process Doc discovers and takes a replica LeMat, chambered for more common, modern ammo. With the sec men fast approaching J.B. rigs the armory with a timed explosive and the group flees downstairs; the ensuing explosion kills most of the sec men and starts a massive fire. Baron Nathan is killed by Doc, while Marie seeks cover and Guiteau takes Dean hostage, using him as a human shield. Mildred takes careful aim, shooting off Guiteau's trigger finger and then killing him with a shot between the eyes once Dean is clear. Michael declares he will deal with Marie himself, calmly approaches her while she tries (and fails) to shoot him, and after exchanging some brief, unheard words with the woman, he snaps her neck. The companions then leave for the redoubt. The thawed bodies in the upper floors of the redoubt have rotted thoroughly, causing most of the cannies to die of starvation. After making their way through the near-unbearable stench the companions arrive at the MAT- TRANS chamber. Everyone links hands, lest they be sent to separate locations, and Ryan closes the door to start the jump.

Roger-Bernard III (1243 - 3 March 1302) was the Count of Foix from 1265 to his death. He was the son of Roger IV of Foix and Brunissende of Cardona. He entered into conflicts with both Philip III of France and Peter III of Aragon, who held him in captivity for a time. He was nevertheless a distinguished poet and troubadour. Conflict with Philip III His conflict with Philip III was rooted in the longstanding desire of the French monarchy to establish its authority in Languedoc, where, since the 10th century, it had been practically a nonentity. In 1272, Roger-Bernard allied with Gerald VI, Count of Armagnac to attack the lord of Sompuy, who, however, applied for protection to the king. This brought the king and the count into direct opposition. Ignoring the royal command, the two counts went to war. Philip, claiming rights as the heir of his uncle Alfonso of Poitou, invaded Languedoc at the head of a large army. Roger-Bernard fled to his castle at Foix and the Seneschal of Toulouse, Eustache de Beaumarch√®s, seized his lands. Roger- Bernard, meanwhile, placed himself under the competing protection of James I of Aragon, who endeavoured to negotiate a peace. Roger-Bernard, however, demanded harsh and unacceptable conditions. On 3 June, King Philip began the siege of Foix and on 5 June, the citadel fell by the work of the sappers in tearing down its defensive walls. Roger-Bernard surrendered and was carted off to prison in Carcassonne. The dispute between James and Philip, however, did not immediately abate. The former refused to relinquish what he held on behalf of the imprisoned count. On 8 February 1273, the conflict was resolved and the king of Aragon gave up his claims. Before the end of that year, the count of Foix was released and did homage to the king of France, receiving back a portion of his confiscated lands. Roger-Bernard's relationship with Philip III was thereafter solid, with Philip even considering him his \\"most loyal and faithful vassal\\" in December 1277. War of the Navarrese Succession On the death of Henry I of Navarre in 1274, a dispute arose over the succession to that small kingdom. Henry's heir was his daughter Joanna, wife of Philip the Fair, then heir-apparent of Philip III. The Aragonese, however, opposed her succession, which would have put the French in control of Navarre. In order to secure Joanna and Philip's rightful inheritance, Roger-Bernard led a French army into Navarre in September 1276. He took the capital city of Pamplona by force and razed it. In gladful compensation for this, Philip III restored all the count's remaining territories south of the Pas de La Barre. Formation of Andorra Perhaps the most lasting of Roger-Bernard's policies was his diplomatic agreement with the bishop of Urgell concerning the possession of Andorra, a small mountain landlocked territory with a long history of quarrels over its lordship between bishop and count. On 8 September 1278, after long negotiations, the count and the bishop concluded a par√©age, a form of condominium, over the disputed country. Though slightly modified a little later (the same year), the par√©age remains the governing system of Andorra to this day, though the office of Count of Foix has devolved to the Presidency of France since that time. Conflict with Aragon In Spring 1280, the long- stewing conflict between Roger-Bernard and Peter of Aragon broke out into open rebellion. The count of Foix formed a coalition of other dissatisfied Catalan nobles, including Arnold Roger I of Pallars Sobir√† and Ermengol X of Urgell, and revolted against Peter. Besieged in Balaguer, he was forced to surrender on 22 July and was imprisoned. While the other leaders of the revolt were released the next year, Roger-Bernard languished in an Aragonese dungeon until December 1283, at which time it was politically expedient to free him in exchange for the viscounty of Castelbon in an effort to stave off French aggression in the form of the so-called \\"Aragonese Crusade.\\" Roger-Bernard, however, was not beholden to the then-excommunicate king of Aragon and readily sided with the invading French. First, on 25 May 1285, Elne and then, on 7 September, Girona surrendered to their French besiegers, Raimond-Roger, brother of the Count of Pallars Sobir√†, negotiating the surrenders with the count of Foix. Relationship with Philip IV In 1290, Roger-Bernard tried to stop the seneschals of Toulouse and Carcassonne from interfering in his internal affairs, such as the administration of justice and the collection of taxes. Philip III, now King of France, refused to call off his functionaries and diminish his own authority in the south and was thus forced to confiscate two of the count's castles as punishment for his disobedience and lack of cooperation with the crown. Nonetheless, in 1293, the king finally intervened to order the seneschal of Carcassonne to leave the count of Foix's matters to the count of Foix. In 1295, Philip made the count Governor of Gascony and, on 29 April, ordered the seneschal to return the confiscated castles of 1290. In 1295, Roger-Bernard alleged that the seneschal was levying taxes without his consent or permission to finance the war with England. As a means of paying the count back for these imposts, Philip granted him castles in July 1295 and 1298. When Bernard Saisset, bishop of Pamiers, was inciting the people of Toulouse to revolt, it was to Roger-Bernard that he went looking for a leader. He was refused and the count informed the king. Inheritance of B√©arn Margaret of Montcada In 1252, Roger-Bernard married Margaret of B√©arn (also called Margaret of Montcada), the daughter of Gaston VII of B√©arn and Martha of Marsan. In his will, Gaston declared Margaret to be his heir, which was generally accepted, though not by his second daughter Mathe and her husband Gerard VI of Armagnac. Later, Gaston declared his third daughter Guillemette the new heir, but when he died in 1290, Roger-Bernard immediately took possession of his counties (May). Roger-Bernard then divided his coat of arms between that of Foix and that of B√©arn. In 1293, after three years of peace, Gerard V finally contested the usurpation of B√©arn and began a long war with Roger-Bernard over the rights of their wives. This war lasted until 1377. When the aforementioned Guillemette donated all her Catalan lands to James II of Aragon in April 1300, Roger-Bernard opposed her and traveled at the head of troops through the pass of the Col de Puymorens in the Pyrenees. He died at Tarascon-sur-Ari√®ge on 3 March 1302 and was buried in Boulbonne beside his ancestors. Roger-Bernard and Margaret had: *Gaston I, his successor *Constance, married (1296) John I de L√©vis, lord of Mirepoix *Mathe, married (1294) Bernard IV of Astarac *Margaret (died 1304), married (1291) Bernard IV Jordan of L'Isle-Jourdain *Brunissende, married (1298) Elias VII of P√©rigord References Sources  * * - Category:1243 births Category:1302 deaths Category:13th-century Princes of Andorra Category:14th-century Princes of Andorra Category:House of Foix Category:Counts of Foix Category:Troubadours Category:Occitan nobility Category:Princes of Andorra Category:French male poets Category:Male composers ","title":"Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix"},{"id":"9828552","text":"Saibai Island Airport is an airport on Saibai Island, Queensland, Australia.

Tamworth Airport is the northern base of the Hunter Region Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service and the location for IFTT Flight Training College, and CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Tamworth  History  No. 6 Elementary Flying Training School of the Royal Australian Air Force was formed in 1940, during the Second World War, at the original airfield (located in what is now the Taminda industrial area) as part of the Empire Air Training Scheme. Training included 50 hours of basic aviation instruction on a simple trainer like the Tiger Moth. Pilots who showed promise went on to advanced training at a Service Flying Training School. Others went on to different specialties, such as Wireless Schools, Air Observer Schools or Bombing and Gunnery Schools. The RAAF airfield went on to become the original home of East West Airlines after WW2. In 1951 a decision was taken to relocate the aerodrome with the council commencing construction in 1952 and the official opening of the new airport in 1956. The airport received a further upgrade to medium jet standard in 1982. The addition of the parallel runway and associated facility expansion was undertaken between 1990 and 1993 as part of the establishment of the British Aerospace/Ansett pilot training joint venture which has evolved into the Bae systems college. Bae systems withdrew from Tamworth Airport in 2020 and the college facilities were re-branded as International Flight Training Tamworth (IFTT), under the ownership of Tamworth Regional Council, with CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Tamworth remaining on site.

The parish was established in 1845, and a church was built in the same year. The entire church complex, including the rectory, convent and parish school, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The parish was closed by the archdiocese in 2002, after which the property was sold.  Cemetery  As was common in the 19th century, the parish property included space for a cemetery, which was blessed in 1850. However, due to its small size, the cemetery had filled by 1868. There were about 600 people (mostly Irish immigrants from County Donegal) buried in the cemetery. After 1882, the city mapmakers ceased including it and the parish gradually forgot that it existed. As early as 1887, when the parish grammar school was built next to it, there seemed to be no recognition of the cemetery. It was nothing more than a field with no visible gravestones. A former parish property, now used as a charter school However, in the 1990s, a construction crew discovered a gravestone while digging a trench. The digging stopped, but no other artifacts were found. Again, in 2006, digging commenced. The parish property had been sold by the archdiocese and the parish needed confirmation that there were no longer human remains on site.

It has the task of promoting research under its own auspices and in collaboration with academics in and outside Germany. It has its seat in the university town of G√∂ttingen. History The K√∂nigliche Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften (\\"Royal Society of Sciences\\") was founded in 1751 by King George II of Great Britain, who was also Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire and Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (Hanover), the German state in which G√∂ttingen was located. The first president was the Swiss natural historian and poet Albrecht von Haller. It was renamed the \\"Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G√∂ttingen\\" in 1939. Among the learned societies in the Federal Republic of Germany, the G√∂ttingen academy is the second-oldest after the Halle-based Leopoldina (1652).  Organisation  The Academy is a K√∂rperschaft des √∂ffentlichen Rechts and has the task to serve academic research in its own work and in collaboration with researchers and institutions inside and outside Germany. Its members are divided into two classes, the Mathematical-Physical class and the Philological-Historical class. There are a maximum number of forty full members in each class and a maximum of one hundred corresponding members, elected from the rest of Germany and outside the country. The review and literature journal G√∂ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen has been published by the Academy since 1753 and is the oldest academic journal still published in the German-language area.

Although, until recently, less precise than the more traditional mechanomyography, it is considerably easier to set up. The signal is measured using condenser microphone elements, piezoelectric sensors, accelerometers, or a combination of sensors attached to the skin. Hydrophones have also been used to measure muscles immersed in water. Improvements in microphones and contact transducers (piezoelectric devices), as well as recording systems, has meant that they have become available in a size and of a quality that enables them to be applied to a normal daily setting outside the clinic and the laboratory setting. These new possibilities provide a clinical tool for the assessment of patients with musculoskeletal complaints during daily activities, or assessment of athletes in terms of efficiency in use of muscles. The sound created by muscle movement can be heard with the ear pressed up to a contracting muscle, but most of the energy is low frequency, below 20 Hz, making it inaudible infrasound. Electromyography signals are typically bandpass filtered from 10 Hz to 500 Hz, by comparison. PMG signals are limited to 5 Hz to 100 Hz in some experiments.http://www.uta.edu/faculty/jcramer/KINE5328/5328_4_Spring05.ppt Orizio states that the low-frequency response of the sensor is the most important feature, and should go as low as 1 Hz. Images of PMG waves are available in this creative commons-licensed document, \\"Mechanomyographic amplitude and frequency responses during dynamic muscle actions: a comprehensive review\\".  History  Muscle sounds were first described in print by the Jesuit scientist Francesco Maria Grimaldi in a posthumous publication of 1665, which influenced the work of the English physician William Hyde Wollaston and the German scientist Paul Erman. The latter enlisted the aid of Ren√© Laennec. Mechanical amplification was first employed by Hermann von Helmholtz. The past two centuries of repeated rediscovery and neglect of the phenomenon were summarised by Stokes and Blythe in 2001.  References  :8.

Background The Corporation of the City of Whyalla has operated the airport since 1991 when it was handed over by the Australian government. By 2009, the main runway's Pavement Classification Number (PCN) had deteriorated to an 8, which stopped all heavy aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, from using the airport. The airport remained open for use by the Department of Defence C-130 Hercules transport aircraft until the late 1990s. The City of Whyalla, aware of the accelerating damage caused by C-130 operations, asked the Federal Government for financial assistance in upgrading the main runway to accommodate unrestricted C-130 operations. The idea was for the airport to accommodate medium-sized commercial jets as well as the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft. The government declined to offer the City of Whyalla financial assistance to upgrade the main runway. In response, Mayor John Smith stopped all C-130 operations in Whyalla, causing the RAAF to use either RAAF Woomera Airfield or RAAF Base Edinburgh to fly in troops and supplies for the nearby Cultana Training Area. In 2004, Qantas requested permission to land a Boeing 767 at Whyalla Airport as both Adelaide and Melbourne airports were closed due to fog. Council made the runway available should Qantas need it, but only on the understanding that the Boeing may not be able to take off again. The Qantas Boeing 767 made it safely to its intended destination, but the whole incident highlighted the need for Whyalla to upgrade its main runway to safely accommodate such aircraft in the future. In 2008, the main runway remained substandard for anything other than Saab 340 use or lower. Whyalla Airport found itself in a difficult position in 2009 as the South Australian mining boom got underway. The city would make an ideal fly in/fly out location for the new mines, but lacks the infrastructure to accommodate commercial jets. The City of Whyalla lacks the funds to initiate an upgrade of the main runway and both the Australian and State Governments are reluctant to financially help out, regardless of which political party is in power. On Wednesday, 17 September 2008, it was announced that the City of Whyalla were investigating spending over A$4 million on upgrading the airport to accept Boeing 737 aircraft. The study is to determine if the airport upgrade is economically feasible. The study will also look at funding options. As of February 2012, Council does not have the required $4.5 million for the pavement upgrade, but has some plans to improve the terminal facilities. It is hoped some grants will be made available for the upgrade via both the Australian and State Governments. One source of funding the council is looking at is selling some of the airport land (of which there is plenty surrounding the actual airport itself) to raise the required funds. In 2009, Council started the process of handing over the day-to-day running of the airport to another company. This company is conducting its feasibility study and an answer was expected by August 2009. However, the airport was still operated by the Corporation of the City of Whyalla in July 2012. A refurbished terminal was completed in mid 2014, with this upgrade allowing Qantaslink to begin services to the airport from April the following year. The airline offers 13 flights per week between Adelaide and Whyalla. Bombardier Q300 aircraft is used on the route. Regional Express maintain multiple flights per day to Adelaide on their Saab 340 Aircraft.

It was the last chamber composition he wrote during his sojourn in the United States. Dvo≈ô√°k catered the sonatina to the gradually developing musical abilities of his children, especially those of his 15-year-old daughter Otilie and 10-year-old son Ton√≠k, who played piano and violin respectively. In a letter to Fritz Simrock on January 2, 1894, Dvo≈ô√°k conceived the piece in the following terms: \\"It is intended for youths (dedicated to my two children), but even grown-ups, adults, should be able to converse with it...\\"Score, p. VII The sonatina was published by Simrock in Berlin in 1894. It also exists in a version for cello and piano. Structure The four short movements of the sonatina each exhibit a simple and clear, formal structure (hence the diminutive, cf. sonata). They all contain themes, which, like those already found in his other American chamber works (the String Quartet in F and the String Quintet in E), owe their inspiration to Indian melodies and Negro spirituals, which are characterized by pentatonic scales and syncopated rhythm, among other traits. The mood of the composition is fresh and joyful. Only the second movement and part of the last movement are nostalgic; they are inspired by the composer's longing for his home country.Score, p.

It is located at the intersection of the Princes Highway and Illawarra Highway at Albion Park Rail. The airport is an 80-minute drive from Sydney Airport and 60 minutes from Sydney's southern suburbs. A regular rail service is available at Albion Park Rail, 900 metres from the passenger terminal, on the South Coast rail line. The airport is home to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) and a range of tourism-related operations. History = World War II = As early as the 1920s, aviators had used fields in the Albion Park area for pleasure flights and demonstrations. RAAF Albion Park was built in 1942 as a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Operational Base during World War II on land compulsorily acquired by the Australian Government. The base was used to conduct pilot training and was considered an important strategic asset in the defence of the Illawarra, particularly the steelworks at Port Kembla. Decorated fighter ace Clive Caldwell, a local resident, received RAAF training at the airfield. A satellite airfield was constructed north of Cordeaux Dam to support operations at Albion Park.Illawarra Regional Airport Shellharbour Heritage Inventory = Post War = Following the war, Trans Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways linked the airport with Canberra and Melbourne until 1950. From 1952, South Coast Airways operated a milk run between Sydney and Melbourne with intermediate stops in Wollongong (Albion Park), Bairnsdale and Sale.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2870943? Ownership of the airfield was transferred to the Shellharbour Municipal Council in 1962.http://www.illawarraregionalairport.com.au/default.aspx?WebPage=23 Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited the airport during a 1970 tour of Australia. Also during the 1970s, Southbank Aviation introduced commuter services from Albion Park to Newcastle and Canberra. The company would later relocate operations to Sydney, but Shellharbour Airport remained an important facility for pilot training and aircraft maintenance into the 1980s. In 1990, the first master plan was prepared for the Shellharbour Airport (then named Illawarra Regional Airport), providing a framework for future management and developments when Shellharbour City Council assumed full responsibility for the operation of the airport. Throughout the 1990s, development of facilities continued, including the construction of a new passenger terminal and upgrades to roads and navigation aids at the airport. Impulse Airlines operated to the airport from Melbourne and Newcastle until August 2000. In 2002, the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society began relocating their collection of aircraft to Shellharbour Airport from Bankstown Airport in Sydney. Their hangar was completed in 2005, along with several other major upgrades, including the strengthening and reconstruction of runway 16/34 with better lighting, enhanced security, and the opening of Shellharbour City's Light Aeronautics Industry Cluster. Coinciding with this upgrade was the commencement of Qantaslink services to Melbourne, although these were discontinued in 2008. In 2019, it was renamed from Illawarra Regional Airport to its present name. Airport facilities The primary runway is 16/34, with a paved surface measuring . A displaced threshold reduces the available landing distance on runway 34 by to allow aircraft to clear high terrain along the approach path. 16/34 is equipped with pilot activated low intensity runway lighting, as well as precision approach path indicator systems to assist with landings under varying conditions. The secondary runway 08/26 is suitable for day operations only as it is not equipped with runway lighting and is restricted to aircraft with Maximum Takeoff Weights less than . There is no control tower located at the airport and pilots must co-ordinate arrivals and departures using a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency, aided by an Aerodrome Frequency Response Unit (AFRU), which notifies pilots that their transmissions have been received on the frequency and activates lighting systems as appropriate. The nearest radio navigation aid for pilots is the Wollongong Non-Directional Beacon installation located within the airport boundary. Fuel is available for piston, turbine and jet powered aircraft and an automated weather service also operates at the airport. Despite the length of the runway being sufficient for operating large passenger jets such as the Boeing 737, the pavements are currently only suitable for aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight not exceeding .http://www.illawarraregionalairport.com.au/default.aspx?WebPage=30 This, as well as environmental and noise issues, limits the potential of Shellharbour Airport as a major gateway for commercial airline operations despite its proximity to Sydney.http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/aviation/sydney_av_cap/files/sac_part_seven_options.pdf Despite this, Qantas donated City of Canberra, a Boeing 747-400 on 8 March 2015, where it made its final landing safely on the runway. Pilots trained on simulations for the landing and reduced the aircraft's weight including reducing the tyre pressure to 120 pounds per square inch from the typical 208, and carrying 25,400 litres of fuel, versus the maximum of 217,000 litres. Airlines and destinations =Passenger= The airline Link Airways offers daily services from the airport to Melbourne (9 weekly returns) and Brisbane (4 weekly returns). Link Airways service these routes using 34 seat Saab 340B+ turboprop aircraft. Previously, commencing on 30 October 2017, JETGO Australia became the first airline to operate regular passenger services from Wollongong airport since the termination of Qantaslink flights in 2008.https://www.ch- aviation.com/portal/news/57561-australias-jetgo-chosen-for-wollongong-airport- flights This was also the first time that jet aircraft have been operated for scheduled passenger services.

(2007) Etymology Nothoprocta comes from two Greek words, nothos meaning spurious or counterfeit and pr≈çktos meaning hindpart or tail. Experts are unsure, however, they believe that this refers to the hidden tail of this Genus behind body feathers.Gotch, A. F. (1995) Taxonomy All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Kalinowski's tinamou Nothoprocta kalinowskii was considered a separate species but further research has deemed it a junior synonym of Nothoprocta ornata branickii, and the SACC voted to do just that on 14 Feb 2007.Remsen Jr., J. V. (2007) =Subspecies= The ornate tinamou has three subspecies as follows: * N. o. ornata The nominate race occurs in the Andes of southeastern Peru, extreme northern Chile and western Bolivia * N. o. branickii occurs in the puna of central Peru; Ancash, Lima, Ica, Jun√≠n, Ayacucho, Huancavelica, and Apur√≠mac Regions * N. o. rostrata occurs in the Andes of northwestern Argentina; Jujuy and La Rioja Provinces Description Illustration by Joseph Smit, 1895 The ornate tinamou is approximately in length. Its upper parts are brownish-grey marked with black and buff, it is tawny-buff below with darker barring. Its head and neck are buff with prominent black spots, its bill is slender and curved, and its legs are either yellow or grey. Behavior Like other tinamous, the ornate tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2‚Äì3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Range This species is native to the puna of central Peru and the Andes of southeastern Peru, western Bolivia, extreme northern Chile, and northwestern Argentina. Habitat The ornate tinamou lives in high-altitude grassland. They also live in shrubland, both high and low elevation, and they are showing some success of living on farmland.

(2008) Description The Chilean tinamou is approximately in length. It is almost tail-less and is stocky in shape. It has a bill that is curved and similar to the California quail. It has thick, short, pale, yellowish legs. It generally walks upright and has \\"short tail and tail coverts drooping behind legs.\\" The pattern on its upper body looks striped, but is more complex in detail. It has a buffy face with a dark eyeline that is drooping and a small strip on its cheek, with a lighter colored crown. Its neck is brown and its lower neck has dark spots. It has a complex patterns that streak on the side of the chest, which is grey. The Chilean tinamou, just south of the Maule Region, has a brownish chest instead of a grey chest and more and reddish brown stripes on its upperbody and buttocks. For both regions, it has large wings that cover the body when on ground, and when flying the wings appear large and reddish brown underneath. The wings are also rounded.Jaramillo, Alvaro, 28. It has a loud stride whistle that sounds double-syllabled and sounds like \\"sweee weee.\\" When under stress, it releases a lowering series of whistles that sounds like \\"swee wee wee wee\\" along with fast-paced wing sounds. Behavior The females lay 10-12 glossy eggs in a scrape. The male incubates the eggs and raises the chicks. The eggs are covered with feathers when left unattended. Incubation is around 21 days. The chicks are buff with dark stripes, and run soon after hatching and fly when half-grown. Later in life blue or gray spots may appear.

The scripture takes its name from the householder Kevatta, who invites the Buddha to display various miraculous powers in order to show his spiritual superiority. The Buddha responds by expressing his belief that supernatural powers are not a valid measure of spiritual development, because they can be falsified through the use of charms and spells. He goes on to deliver a discourse on virtue, expressing the belief that it is virtuous conduct, rather than supernatural developments, that display the superiority or spiritual development of a teacher. He also states that such practices will give rise to powers greater than those available to practitioners of traditional magic and austerities. The scripture is significant to the study of Buddhism because it constitutes one of the clearest statements in the scriptures of the Buddha's opposition to the notion of magical power and supernatural abilities as the best indicator of truth or virtue. In setting out such a belief, the Buddha placed himself in opposition to much of the popular religious traditions derived from the Vedas, which often focused on the acquisition of supernatural powers as an ends unto itself, and as a means of measuring spiritual worthiness.

Rafael is the prime contractor and IAI is the major subcontractor for the SPYDER program. This system achieved a notable milestone in 2005 when missiles were fired against test targets in Shdema, Israel and scored direct hits. Since then, it has been showcased in multiple military exhibitions throughout the world. The SPYDER is a low-level, quick-reaction surface-to-air missile system capable of engaging aircraft, helicopters, unmanned air vehicles, drones, and precision-guided munitions. It provides air defence for fixed assets and for point and area defence for mobile forces in combat areas. The system is fitted atop a Tatra truck, a Mercedes-Benz Actros truck, a MAN TGS truck, Scania P-series truck, Dongfeng truck, or a TELAR. It implements the Python-5 and Derby missiles of the same company. The SPYDER launcher is designed to fire Python-5 and Derby surface-to-air missiles which share full commonality with the air-to-air missiles. There are two variants of the SPYDER: the SPYDER-SR (short range) and the SPYDER-MR (medium range). Both systems are quick reaction, all weather, network-centric, multi-launchers, and self-propelled. A typical battery consists one central command and control unit, six missile firing units, and a resupply vehicle. The SPYDER-SR uses the EL/M-2106 ATAR radar while the SPYDER-MR incorporates the EL/M-2084 MMR radar. The latter is the same radar used by the Iron Dome system currently in service with the Israel Defense Forces. Current operators of the SPYDER missiles system include India and Singapore. Peru's order for the SPYDER was pending as of 2012. There are reports that claim that Georgia operated the SPYDER-SR during the 2008 Russo- Georgian War but these allegations and assumptions have never been verified. Development In 2005, a milestone for the SPYDER air defence system was achieved. The SPYDER successfully fired the Python 5 and Derby in a test range located in Shdema, Israel. The results were two direct kills against a couple of targets. At the trial, the radar and command and control unit engaged the targets at long and short ranges. The trial was part of a greater series of missile firings. =Exhibitions= The SPYDER air defence system has been showcased in 29 military exhibitions throughout the world. These exhibitions are: Description =Command and control= EL/M-2106 ATAR The Elta EL/M-2106 Advanced Tactical Acquisition Radar (ATAR) 3D Active electronically scanned array (AESA) surveillance radar is the Command and Control Unit (CCU) for the SPYDER-SR. This radar can track and engage multiple targets simultaneously and can control the missile firing units at a distance of up to 10 km away from the CCU. The E/LM-2106 ATAR is a fourth generation defence radar designed by Elta and operates in the L-band wavelength. It is a field proven design that has operated in undesirable environments according to the designers and manufacturers. The range of detection for a fighter aircraft is 70‚Äì110 km. It can detect hovering helicopters at a range of 40 km and UAVs at 40‚Äì60 km. EL/M-2084 MMR The radar sensor unit of the SPYDER-MR comprises the EL/M-2084 Multi Mission Radar (MMR) 3D AESA radar. The EL/M-2084 operates in the S-band. It can process up to 1200 targets when in air surveillance mode and also detects targets located 250 km away. When the radar is static, it covers 120¬∞ in the azimuth. =Surface-to-air missiles= Ranges of Interception As a short range air defence system, the SPYDER-SR has a short range of interception. The maximum altitude of interception is 9 km and the maximum range of interception is 15 km. The SPYDER-MR has a greater operation range of 35 km and an altitude engagement of 16 km due to the missiles being equipped with boosters. Python-5 The Python-5 is currently the most capable air-to-air missile (AAM) in Israel's inventory and one of the most advanced AAMs in the world. As a beyond-visual- range missile, it is capable of \\"lock-on after launch\\" (LOAL), and has all- aspect/all-direction (including rearward) attack ability. The missile features an advanced electro-optical infrared homing (with imaging infrared) seeker which scans the target area for hostile aircraft, then locks-on for terminal chase. Derby The Derby is an active radar homing AAM that provides the SPYDER missile system with a fire-and-forget option due to its active radar guidance. Operational use * During the Russo-Georgian War of 2008, it was believed that Georgia operated the SPYDER-SR. The Georgian air force could have operated up to four launchers of the SPYDER-SR. * On 26 February 2019, during the 2019 India-Pakistan standoff, India used SPYDER to shoot down a surveillance drone of the Pakistan armed forces at the Indo-Pakistan Border at Gujarat. * On 27 February 2019, during Pakistan Air Force (PAF) airstrikes in Indian-administered Kashmir, SPYDER air defense system accidentally shot down an IAF Mil Mi-17 in Budgham, Kashmir. As a result, six Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel on board the helicopter and one civilian on the ground were killed. After 6 months of investigation, IAF confirmed that shooting down of Mi-17 was a friendly fire and 5 IAF personnel were held guilty.

With deliveries expected in 2023, the SPYDER will replace the ageing Soviet-era 2K12 Kub systems. ; *Defense Forces of Georgia ‚Äì There were reports that a battery of the SPYDER missile system was operated in 2008. No official confirmation exists and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) arms transfer database cannot confirm this. Jane's Missiles & Rockets magazine previously cited a Rafael representative claiming that one of the two export customers of the SPYDER missile system already has theirs deployed. ; *Indian Air Force ‚Äì In 2006, India planned to acquire 18 SPYDER-MR systems at a cost of $395.2 million (Rs. 1800 crore) for its air force. The contract was reviewed by the Central Vigilance Commission, the government‚Äôs anti-corruption agency, before the agreement was signed in September 2008. In August 2009, the multibillion- dollar contract for Israeli anti-aircraft missiles was cleared by the Defence Acquisition Council headed by defence minister AK Antony. Although previous estimates of the contract's value was 18 billion rupees ($395.2 million), recent reports indicate a lower value of $260 million. The Jerusalem Post contradicts these figures and mentions a price of $1 billion for the purchase of the surface-to-air missiles. The SPYDER systems were delivered starting in 2012. 18 SPYDER-MRs along with 750 Python-5 surface to air missiles (SAMs) and 750 Derby SAMs has been delivered. ; *Republic of Singapore Air Force ‚Äì In 2008, the Ministry of Defence ordered two SPYDER-SR batteries along with 75 Python-5 SAMs and 75 Derby SAMs. They were all delivered during 2011 and 2012. Some SPYDER-SRs were operated by the 165 Squadron in 2011, it is also reported that more SPYDER-SRs are on order. The SPYDER system achieved full operational capacity on July 4, 2018. ; * In 2015, Vietnam chose the SPYDER missile system as its new medium-range air defense missile system.http://worlddefencenews.blogspot.ae/2015/10/vietnam-has-selected- israeli-rafael.htmlhttp://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/india-to-buy-israeli- spyder-mobile-air-defense-system-02702/ First deliveries were highlighted in July 2016.

Amidst the presence of Russia's Rosoboronexport and Chinese firms, the winners were Poland's Bumar Group, Israel's Rafael Advanced Defence Systems, and the USA's Northrop Grumman. Rafael industries is expected to supply six SPYDER-SR systems in this deal. ; *Philippine Air Force - Leading Philippine Defense Blog MaxDefense Philippines reported the selection of the SPYDER-MR for its ground-based air defense system (GBADS) requirement. During the Philippine Air Force Change of Command ceremony on December 21, 2018, outgoing Air Force chief Lt. Gen. Galileo Gerard Kintanar Jr. said that \\"three air defense systems from Israel\\" will be acquired. No specific model was mentioned by Kintanar despite the SPYDER being the only Israeli product evaluated. Through a text message sent to the Philippine News Agency, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana confirmed the selection of the SPYDER but did not disclose the number of batteries to be purchased.

Unlike most molluscs, the blood of ram's horn snails contains iron-based hemoglobin instead of copper-based hemocyanin. As a result, planorbids are able to breathe oxygen more efficiently than other molluscs. The presence of hemoglobin gives the body a reddish colour. This is especially apparent in albino animals. Being air breathers like other Panpulmonata, planorbids do not have gills, but instead have a lung. The foot and head of planorbids are rather small, while their thread-like tentacles are relatively long. Many of the species in this family have coiled shells that are planispiral, in other words, the shells are more or less coiled flat, rather than having an elevated spire as is the case in most gastropod shells. Although they carry their shell in a way that makes it appear to be dextral, the shell of coiled planorbids is in fact sinistral in coiling, but is carried upside down, which makes it appear to be dextral. General taxonomic context For several taxa, no consensus exists as to whether the taxa should even be assigned to the family Planorbidae. This is certainly the case with the freshwater limpets Ferrissia, and Ancylus. Both of these genera have sometimes been assigned to the family Lymnaeidae. Alternatively sometimes each one of them is raised to the level of a family. However, according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005), these genera are currently placed in the tribe Ancylini within the family Planorbidae, and that is the taxonomic system that is followed here. 2005 taxonomy Albino planorbid clearly shows the reddish-colored body tissues due to the pigment hemoglobin According to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005), this family consists of the following subfamilies: * subfamily Planorbinae Rafinesque, 1815 ** tribe Planorbini Rafinesque, 1815 \\\\- synonyms: Choanomphalinae Fisher & Crosse, 1880; Orygoceratidae Brusina, 1882 ** tribe Ancylini Rafinesque, 1815 \\\\- synonym: Pseudancylinae Walker, 1923 (inv.) ** tribe Biomphalariini Watson, 1954 \\\\- synonyms: Acrorbini Starobogatov, 1958; Drepanothrematini Zilch, 1959; Taphiinae Harry & Hubendick, 1964 ** tribe Planorbulini Pilsbry, 1934 ** tribe Segmentinini Baker, 1945 * subfamily Bulininae Fischer & Crosse, 1880 ** tribe Bulinini Fischer & Crosse, 1880 \\\\- synonyms: Laevapicinae Hannibal, 1912; Isidorinae Annandale, 1922; Gundlachiinae Starobogatov, 1967 ** tribe Coretini Gray, 1847 \\\\- synonyms: Pompholicinae Dall, 1866 (inv.); Camptoceratinae Dall, 1870; Megasystrophinae Tryon, 1871 (inv.); Pompholycodeinae Lindholm, 1927; Helisomatinae Baker, 1928; Bayardellini Starobogatov & Prozorova, 1990; Planorbariini Starobogatov, 1990 ** tribe Miratestini Sararsin & Sarasin, 1897 \\\\- synonyms: Ferrissiinae Walker, 1917; Ancylastrinae Walker, 1923; Protancylinae Walker, 1923; Physastrinae Starobogatov, 1958; Ameriannini Zilch, 1959; Patelloplanorbidae Franc, 1968 ** tribe Plesiophysini Bequaert & Clench, 1939 * subfamily Neoplanorbinae Hannibal, 1912 \\\\- synonym: Payettiinae Dall, 1924 * subfamily Rhodacmeinae Walker, 1917 2007 taxonomy for part of the family Albrecht et al.

It was recognised by Curry (1965, p. 360) as a euthecosomatous pteropod (Heterobranchia) (note by Arie W. Janssen, 092507). The generic name Taphius Adams & Adams, 1855 is a synonym for Biomphalaria. Shell description shell of Biomphalaria tenagophila. Scale bar is 3 mm. The shells of most species in this family are disk-like or button-like, being coiled in one plane, although several groups have shells that are more higher- spired, and some are limpet-like. All coiled shell Planorbidae are sinistral in their shell coiling, as is proved by their internal anatomy (the respiratory and the genital orifice are situated on the left side), however the animals carry their shells with what would normally be the ventral (i.e. umbilical) surface uppermost, and because of this, the shells appear to be dextral. Indeed, formerly planorbids were thought to have dextral shells, and so species of this family were figured as if they had dextral shells. Although it is now understood that these species are sinistral in shell coiling, disk- like Planorbid shells are often still shown in illustrations oriented as if they were dextral. Most species of coiled planorbids have a rather thin and moderately smooth shell, although more distinct sculpture such as a keel occurs in, and is diagnostic of, certain species. In the flat, keeled species, the whorls tend to overlap. The aperture has a sharp outer lip. A peristome can be present, but often the lip is not thickened nor reflected. Those planorbid species which have a high-spired shell may have a narrow umbilicus, but frequently this is covered by callus. In height most species vary between 6 mm and 6 cm, however, disk-like shells are usually less than about 2 cm in maximum dimension. Like all pulmonate aquatic snails, ramshorn shells do not have an operculum to close the shell aperture. =Sinistral shells= Planorbarius corneus. View of the sunken spire (held facing downwards in life) Planorbarius corneus. View of the umbilicus (held uppermost in life) Flat- coiled planorbid gastropod shells are hard to understand in terms of their coiling and orientation. Many of the shells of species in this family are almost planispiral in coiling such that one side of the shell often looks rather like the other side, but it is important to bear in mind that nonetheless there is an umbilical side and a spire side of the shell. In addition these are in fact sinistral shells, despite the fact that the snail carries its shell as if it were a normal dextral shell. To make sense of the shell coiling, the following facts are useful: * In life, these pond snails hold their shells upside down compared to the normal gastropod shell orientation, with the umbilicus facing upwards * The spire of the shell is quite sunken in many species, in addition it is carried facing downwards * The umbilicus of the shell is very wide and shallow * In some species the umbilicus is not as deeply \\"dished\\" as the sunken spire is, so superficially it can be hard to tell one from the other However, once it is understood that the planorbid shell is sinistral, if the shell is held with the aperture on the left and facing the observer, then the sunken spire side of the shell is uppermost. This is a convenience for understanding the shell, but is the opposite of the way the shell is actually carried in life. The side of the shell which is in fact the spire (a sunken spire) faces down in the living animal, contrary to what is the case in almost all other shelled gastropods. Because the shell is carried \\"upside down\\" like this, the aperture of the shell is angled to face downwards also, so the aperture faces a little towards the spire, not away from it, as is usually the case in other shelled gastropods. Habitat Most species of planorbids live only in fresh water, such as ponds, lakes, and slow moving rivers. A minority of species are able to survive in brackish water. Geological history Ancestors of ramshorn snails are known with certainty since the Jurassic period. Modern taxa developed in the Jurassic. Geographical distribution Species in this family occur worldwide. In Northwest Europe about 20 species are known (including non-indigenous species). In this region, various extinct taxa are known to have occurred, starting in the Jurassic period.

It is the fifth Open University in India. The jurisdiction of the university is for the State of Maharashtra. The YCMOU has been recognised under section 12 (B) of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. It is a member of associations and bodies like the Association of Indian Universities, Association of Commonwealth Universities, Asian Association of Open Universities, and Commonwealth of Learning, Canada. YCMOU is the only university in India to receive the CoL's Excellence Award twice for overall performance amongst the Commonwealth Countries.https://ycmou.ac.in/awards The University offers offline programmes and has also embarked on online initiatives. The YCMOU has its headquarters at Nashik and provides support to its learners through study centres, which are all over the State of Maharashtra. Maharashtra has a long tradition of educational reforms. Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Panjabrao Deshmukh, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Bhaurao Patil, Swami Ramanand Teerth Dr.Apte and others have contributed to educational philosophy and movement in the state. Due to statutory powers conferred by a 1989 act of the Maharashtra state legislature and the recognition by the ‚ÄòUniversity Grants Commission of India‚Äô, the university can award academic certifications like certificates, diplomas, and graduate, post-graduate, doctoral degrees. Satellite-based education The university has launched EduSat-based education, supported by the Indian Space Research Organisation. The university has established several Virtual Learning Centres in the State, each having two-way audio and video communication facilities. The students registered for programmes at the VLC attend lectures there. The experts deliver their lectures from the main hub at the University Headquarters or from the sub- studio at Pune. These live lecture sessions also provide scope for interaction with students located at distant locations. Video-on-demand The university has conversed satellite‚Äìbased lectures into a streaming video format on the web. YCMOU has launched this facility under its MPSC-UPSC Competitive Examination Guidance Programme. Initially 30 lectures under this programme ‚Äì each having a duration of two hours ‚Äì were made available on the Internet for the students. Registered students could view these lectures from any place where a broadband connection was available. The Study Centers also arranged for group viewing of these lectures. Although this was a pilot run, lectures, video programmes and audio programmes may be made available on the internet in the same manner. Mobile learning vans This project of the university, designed to carry education to remote rural and tribal areas, involves the use of mobile learning vans. The mobile van is a road transport vehicle equipped with computing and communications equipment. It has a seating capacity of 12 learners and has six computers installed i.e. two students per computer. Using multimedia projection system, a larger group of about 50 students can be given education. An on-board generator provides a power supply. The mobile van has the capability to educate virtually, using a transmitting station and a set of mobile van. The hub, located at University HQ, is where educational content is produced. The mobile vans receive the educational content and view it on computers in the mobile van. The first batch of students was provided with computer training using the mobile van in Nanashi, a village with a population of around 2500. It is from Nashik city. Fifty-six students were registered for the first batch. The second batch running over the next three months was also implemented at this village. After the successful completion of the second batch, the mobile learning centre moved to Harsul, another tribal area. Harsul is also a small village having a population of 3500. Two batches of computer literacy programmes were successfully implemented at Harsul. The fifth batch of computer training was implemented at another tribal area in Peth. The sixth and seventh batches were conducted in rural areas in Trimbakeshwar. Presently the eighth batch is undergoing training in a tribal area in Borgaon, a small village in Surgana Tehsil. As the project proceeds further, more and more village and tribal communities will get access to higher education. Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Nashik The Indian Council of Agricultural Research New Delhi established the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) at Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University Nashik in 1994. It is a farm science institution providing training and information services for training and skills in the field of agriculture and rural development. KVK has also established a model farm to disseminate and demonstrate the techniques suitable to the local farming community. This farm, equipped with modern irrigation systems, has crops such as mangos, grapes, sapota, guava, amla, cashewd, litchi, coconut, custard apple, and jackfruit. The KVK has an Administrative building measuring with facilities for Soil & Water testing, Phyto diagnostic, Post Harvest Technology Laboratory and an Agricultural Technology Information Centre. Hostel facilities that can accommodate about 30 farmers are also available in the KVK premises.A novel experiment has also been undertaken with high density plantation, multi-stored cropping and high tech floriculture, use of biotech techniques for pest management, vermiculture biotechnology and modern nursery with various shed net houses to meet the training need of farmers and to supply the required planting material to them. The fruit orchard and polyhouses of the KVK yield considerable commercial production. Last year, of Kesar mango was exported through an agency to Japan. A village concept to demonstrate various farming technologies has also been successfully implemented through a participatory group approach. This has led to increased productivity and overall output of the village and has made a concrete difference to the standard of living of the villagers. Yashwantrao Chavan Smruti Sangrahalay A separate building showcasing various things related to Yashwantrao Chavan have been organised. The sangrahalaya highlight the life of Yashwantrao Chavan. A replica of his village house has been the attraction of visitors. The University has maintained a Special Collection on Yashwantrao Chavan. The Collection includes books written by Yashwantrao Chavan as well as the books written on him. The Collection covers Books, Annuals, Press Clippings, and Photographs etc. Dai (Midwife) training programme Half of India's births take place at home due to underdevelopment in many blocks. Even though part of the national policy for promoting hospital births, the School of Health Sciences launched a Dai training programme of 10 credit points. This is a unique programme in the health sector. Three books and a workbook coupled with a PowerPoint package have been especially developed under this programme. In the first batch, the dais of Nandurbar‚Äîa backward tribal district of Maharashtra- participated in this programme. The programme has now been offered in many rural and urban locations. Recently the programme was also shared with a Bihar NGO in Hindi. Since home births still continue in many parts of the country, we wish to share this programme with other SOUs and institutions. Annual awards To encourage the budding talent in different forms of literature at the State level as well as with a view to giving recognition to the distinguished social contributions of certain individuals, the university has instituted the following awards that are given annually. * Vishakha Kavya Puraskar: The award named after the poetic composition of the poet laureate and winner of the Dnyanpeeth Award, Shri V.V. Shirwadkar (popularly known as ‚ÄòTatyasaheb‚Äô) is given to the best three maiden poetic compositions. * Baburao Bagul Gaurav Puraskar: In recognition of the noted contributions of Shri Baburao Bagul to the field of Marathi literature, an award has been instituted in his name and is given to the maiden writing productions of a budding short-story writer. * Rukmini Puraskar: This award is given to a woman who has made outstanding contributions in social work. Institution of Chairs The aim of the Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University is to become a Mass University and the University has a conscious realisation of her commitments to the community. The university endeavours to achieve this through its Student Welfare and Extramural Studies Centre. Among the various activities regularly conducted may be mentioned the ‚ÄòLok Samwad Satra‚Äô lectures on the occasion of the death anniversaries of Shri. Yashwantrao Chavan, Mahatma Phule, B. R. Ambedkar and Panjabrao Deshmukh - all devoted and dedicated visionaries who embarked upon the movement of social change and made indelible contributions for the upliftment of society. Through the organisation of public lectures by eminent thinkers, social reformers, activists and scholars on these days, the university achieves a dialogue with society and is able to reach out to the common man. The university has also instituted the following Chairs as a tribute to the very significant contributions of some illustrious persons: =Savitribai Phule Chair= Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and his wife Savitribai Phule embarked upon the movement of Female Education and Social Reforms in Maharashtra in the 18th century. Today too, an urgent need is felt to continue the process of emancipation of women and transformation of their lives. With this purpose, the Savitribai Phule Chair was instituted by the university. To monitor the functioning of the Chair, a State Level Steering Committee headed by Snehalata Deshmukh, former Vice-Chancellor, Mumbai University has been constituted. The action plan of the Chair aims at overall development of women in rural and urban areas and the focus of its functioning is on upliftment of women who hail from the neglected and downtrodden strata of the society. =Mahatma Gandhi Chair= Mahatma Gandhi, an apostle of Peace, was not merely the Father of Indian Liberation but also the architect of major social reforms and the overall spiritual regeneration of the country. With the conviction that Mahatma Gandhi's Philosophy of equality, peace, non-violence and communal harmony is relevant even today and in fact, is the need of the hour, the Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University has instituted the Mahatma Gandhi Chair. Under this initiative, a programme has been formulated to enlighten the people born in the post- Independence period about Gandhiji's life and Philosophy. As a part of the programme, a seven-day Residential Camp with the theme 'The Relevance of Mahatma Gandhi's Philosophy Today' was organised during 9 to 15 October 2007 in collaboration with Mumbai Saroday Mandal. 185 students accompanied by their teachers from various parts of the country participated in this Camp. Besides Prayer, Shramdan, Group discussions, Paper presentations and Cultural programme, the participating students were enlightened on Gandhiji's life, work and philosophy. On 30 January 2008 a Bhajan Spardha was organised by the university. Nearly two hundred school children participated in this competition and enthralled the audience. These two programmes are intended as a prelude to further activities under the Mahatma Gandhi Chair of the university. Special programmes =Jail inmates= A special initiative of this university has been to offer educational opportunities to those who are otherwise treated as social outcasts, mainly as a result of their own doings. The prison inmates, apart from serving their term in jail also need an alternative channel to improve their overall attitude towards life and towards their own social setting. With a view to creating a positive attitude in them through imparting education, the university has established Study Centres in the Central Jails at Nagpur, Kolhapur, Nashik, and Pune. Opportunities for receiving academic counselling support are provided in the prison itself and the programme fees have been waived in their case. During the last five years, the total enrolment of Jail inmates in the State of Maharashtra has been over 2,300 and a number of students have even completed their graduation while in jail. =Visually impaired= The visually impaired constitute a 'special group' to whom society must pay concerted attention. Many of them actually aspire for higher education and if given an opportunity, they can also excel in a given field. Realising this need, YCMOU has offered educational opportunities to this group by waiving their fees for various academic programmes. In fact, training in computer skills has also been accomplished for some of these less fortunate fellowmen. By virtue of such initiatives, the university concretely endorses its compliance with the international laws for the handicapped. During the last five years the total enrolment of visually impaired persons in YCMOU has been over 300. Sport activities The University conducts Sports meets every year. The sports meets are organised by eight Regional Centers of the University at regional levels and the students of the study centres in the jurisdiction of the respective region participate in these regional level sports tournaments. After the completion of the regional level tournaments, the students of the eight regions who excel at the regional level tournaments participate in the sports meet organised by the University. Students exhibiting good performance at the university level are sent for the All India Association of Universities tournament and The State level Inter-University tournament ‚ÄòAshwamedh‚Äô every year. The performance of the students of this university in these tournaments so far has been steadily improving. To spur the students to participate further in sports activities, incentive marks (maximum 10) are given to those who excel in various tournaments in accordance with the rules framed for the purpose. Similarly, the students of this university who win gold medals in \\"Ashwamedh\\" are deployed in the services of the University in keeping with the rules framed for the purpose. Ashwamedh In the year 1997 the Annual Inter University Tournament called 'Ashwamedh' was started to create an atmosphere conducive to sports and to provide students with an opportunity to display their talent in the field of sports. Every year the responsibility of organising 'Ashwamedh' is borne by one of the Universities in Maharashtra. Cultural activities Youth festivals are organised every year at eight Regional Centers and the students of the Study Centres of the respective regions participate in programmes like One Act Play, Folk Dance, Singing, and Fine Arts. The student artists who show excellence are invited to participate in the University level Youth Festival. The students who win laurels at the University level Youth Festival are further given an opportunity to represent the Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University in the Inter-University Youth Festival called 'Indra-dhanushaya'. The Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University has been entrusted with the responsibility of organising 'Indra-dhanushaya' 2008 at Nashik. Library and Resource Centre The Library and Resource Centre (LARC) of YCMOU is an important unit that provides academic support through the learning and reference resources it provides. Functions: * Support the academic activities of in-house academics and outside experts by providing information sources for the development of learning material. * Support the reference and information needs of post-graduate and research students of the university. * Provide documents and comprehensive reference and information services in the area of Open and Distance Education for other distance education institutes in the State. * Provide assistance to coordinators of the Library and Information Science programme of the University. Recognition Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University's awarded degrees are recognised by UGC in India. YCMOU is a member of Association of Indian Universities (AIU) and AAOU. All architecture graduate and post-graduate programmes are recognised and approved by the \\"Council of Architecture (CoA)\\". Hence, after successful completion of the graduate degree programme (that is, BArch), student can register with the \\"Council of Architecture (CoA)\\". Student shall be entitled to practice as an architect after such registration. All these degree and post-graduate degree programmes are recognised and approved by the 'University Grant Commission (UGC)‚Äô. Hence, these programmes are equivalent to the respective programmes offered by any other statutory university in India, for the purpose of employment, promotion and further education. International awards This university is a recipient of Institutional Excellence Award-2002 and Sept-2019 from Commonwealth of Learning (COL), Canada. CoL Award For the Second Time Commonwealth of Learning (CoL), the apex body of open and distance learning universities in the commonwealth countries has honored the Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU) Nashik with an Award of Institutional Excellence. The CoL's adjudication panel of experts appreciated YCMOU's impressive record of reaching millions of students and fulfilling the promise of technology and open learning by taking learning opportunities to where students are located. The award was handed over to the Vice chancellor Prof. E. Vayunandan and Registrar Dr. Dinesh Bhonde on September 11, in a Ninth Pan Commonwealth Forum on Open Learning at Edinburgh, Scotland.

The Jaffna Diocese headquarters is in Vaddukoddai. An Amman temple at Sangarathai, a Murugan temples at Adaikalam Thottam and Panguru are three of the main Hindu temples found here. History The name of the village suggests that at some point in its history it had a fortress in its midst, possibly from the Aryacakravarti dynasty. But rule by various colonial powers since 1621 has erased all evidence of a fort. The village became prominent during the British colonial period in Sri Lanka as it was chosen as location for one of the nine protestant missions to be established within the small Jaffna peninsula (hardly 15 by 40 miles). The move by the seminary to study Saiva scriptures led to an important social transformation amongst the local Tamils because it began a process that led to a Saiva revivalism led by Arumuka Navalar. Eventually the seminary was renamed Jaffna college and became a secular institution in 1867. The village also played an important role in the recent Sri Lankan civil war as the place where the Tamil United Liberation Front party came up with the Vaddukoddai Resolution in 1976 that articulated the view that minority Sri Lankan Tamils needed separation from rest of Sri Lanka to resolve their political problems.

The study ran between 1956 and 1960. Nelson recruited Henry Kissinger, who was then on the faculty of Harvard University, as director of the project; he had first met Kissinger in 1955. He also brought on board such luminaries as Edward Teller, Charles Percy, Dean Rusk, John Gardner (president of the Carnegie Corporation) and Henry Luce, along with his brothers Laurance and John D. 3rd. Six panels were constituted that looked at sweeping issues ranging from military/security strategy to foreign policy, to international economic strategy and defense department and governmental reorganization. The seven sub-panels were: *Panel I - International Objectives and Strategies ; chaired by Dean Rusk, the report was written mostly by August Heckscher *Panel II - International Security Objectives and Strategy; directed by Henry Kissinger. Panellists included Frank Altschul, Gordon Dean, James B. Fisk, Roswell Gilpatric, Townsend Hoopes, Henry Luce, Laurance Rockefeller, Edward Teller, Carroll L. Wilson, and economist Arthur Smithies. *Panel III - International Economic and Social Objectives and Strategy ; chaired by Milton Katz. Harlan Cleveland was a panellist. *Panel IV - U.S. Economic and Social Policy; chaired by Thomas B. McCabe *Panel V - U.S. Utilization of Human Resources; chaired by John W. Gardner *Panel VI - U.S. Democratic Process; chaired by James A. Perkins *Panel VII - The Moral Framework of National Purpose; chaired by Richard McKeon, the report written by Robert Heilbroner was never published. The military subpanel's report was rush-released much earlier than the others, about two months after the USSR launched Sputnik, in October, 1957. It was given prominent treatment on the front page of The New York Times, selling thousands of copies and garnering unprecedented influence. Many of its major recommendations - principal among them a massive arms buildup to counter perceived Soviet military superiority - were adopted by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his State of the Union address in January, 1958.Rushed release of military subpanel's report - see Cary Reich, The Life of Nelson A.

It looked at The Crusades and used elements of black comedy. Prominent figures are depicted by actors wearing masks and costumes making to appear as living images in the style of their cultures. Emperor Alexios I, for example, appears as a Byzantine mosaic, while European and Muslim figures are brought to life by actors appearing in the style of medieval and near eastern miniatures. At times, production is deliberately anachronistic, such as showing the use of 1930's style newsreels by the Church to drum up mass support for the Crusades. Episodes =1. \\"Pilgrims in Arms\\"= The first episode recounts Byzantine Emperor Alexius's appeal to Pope Urban II for military aid with which to fight Muslim Turks. The Pope uses the request to drum up popular support for the creation of a Christian army, with the mission of liberating Jerusalem. European knights, recently converted to Christianity, eagerly join the Crusade. The crusader army is preceded by the People's Crusade, a mass migration incited to go to Jerusalem by Peter the Hermit. Recounted are massacres of Jews in Worms and Cologne The People's Crusade is crushed by Turks after the catastrophic Siege of Xerigordos and the Battle of Civetot. Kilij Arslan I, the Seljuq Sultan, emboldened by the quick end of the People's Crusade, underestimates the crusader army when it appears, and suffers defeat against them. The crusaders, having won this early battle confidently set off for Jerusalem. The episode ends with host Terry Jones on the road, wearing the gear of a Crusader, revealing that despite the crusaders' confidence that they would soon be in Jerus . =2. \\"Jerusalem\\"= The second episode covers hardships encountered by crusaders as they neared the Holy City, including intense heat and starvation. Also the Siege of Antioch and Turkish retaliation. =3. \\"Jihad\\"= The third episode chronicles the response that the Arab world gave to the gains of the Crusades. Jones takes the viewer from Syria to Jordan to shed light on the Arabs counter-crusade led by Muslim leader Saladin. Additionally, experts detail the political intrigue behind Saladin's rise to power as he tried to lead Muslims in winning back Jerusalem from the Christians. =4. \\"Destruction\\"= The Crusade of Richard I of England is explored to find the seeds of his eventual failure. The fourth episode examines the massacres during the siege of Acre, the Treaty of Ramla in 1192 when Richard was forced to concede Jerusalem to Saladin, and the establishment of the Empire of Latins in Constantinople after the Crusade of Venetian statesman Enrico Dandolo. Controversy A number of distinguished Crusade historians appeared to give their views on events. The documentary followed the perspective established by Steven Runciman in A History of the Crusades, which casts the Crusades in a negative light. Because the historians did not support this narrative, the producers edited the taped interviews so that the historians seemed to be agreeing with Runciman. Professor Jonathan Riley-Smith accused the producers, \\"they made me appear to say things that I do not believe!\\" References External links * Category:1995 British television series debuts Category:1995 British television series endings Category:1990s British documentary television series Category:Television series about the Crusades Category:BBC television documentaries about history Category:Byzantine Empire in art and culture Category:English-language television shows Category:Medieval documentaries Category:Documentaries about historical events Category:Documentary television series about war ","title":"Crusades (TV series)"},{"id":"9830265","text":"is a railway station in Hyogo-ku, Kobe, Japan, operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) and Kobe Municipal Subway.

(2007) Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore, Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1995) Taxonomy All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) =Subspecies= The curve- billed tinamou has two subspecies as follows: * N. c. curvirostris, the nominate race, occurs in the Andes of central and southern Ecuador and northern Peru (Cordillera del Condor) * N. c. peruviana occurs in the Andes of northern and central Peru; eastern Piura, Cajamarca, Amazonas, western San Mart√≠n, La Libertad, Ancash, and Hu√°nuco Regions =Characteristics= The curve-billed tinamou is approximately in length. Its upper parts are dark brown streaked with white and spotted with black. Its breast is rufous and spotted with white, its belly is tawny-buff and its crown is black, the sides of its head, and its throat and foreneck are white. Finally, its legs are brown in color. Behavior Like other tinamous, the curve-billed tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2‚Äì3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Range and habitat This tinamou lives in the Andes of central and southern Colombia, through Ecuador and northern and central Peru. It prefers grassland at in altitude. It also can be found in high-altitude shrubland and pasture.BirdLife International (2008) Conservation The IUCN list this species as Least Concern, with an occurrence range of .

It is Bolivia's largest prison and holds about 3,500 prisoners.

Guards instead concentrate only on securing the perimeter of the facility. According to former inmates, almost anything can be obtained in the prison, and businesses operate inside the prison to supply weapons and drugs. Prisoners of Palmasola have created an organization called the Disciplina Interna to oversee some affairs. Under Bolivian law, children under the age of six may live in a prison with their parent. As such, Palmasola is home to a number of children. The United Nations has criticized the policy. Four out of five prisoners in Palmasola are awaiting trial.

They then used machetes, small knives, and sticks to attack their rivals, and ignited a number of propane tanks to use as flame throwers or bombs. The riot reportedly started as a battle over leadership and control of the \\"Chonchocorito\\" sector of the prison. Thirty-one people died in the riot, most of whom were burnt to death. Among the dead was an 18-month-old who was living at the prison. A further 37 inmates were seriously injured with burns over 60‚Äì90% of their bodies, and 256 were evacuated. This was the deadliest prison riot in Bolivian history.

Taxonomy The white-bellied nothura is a monotypic species. All tinamous are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds. Description The white-bellied nothura is approximately in length. Its upper parts are light brown and barred black with white streaks. Its throat is white, its foreneck is buff with black streaking, its breast is buff and its belly is white. Its crown is dark brown and the sides of its head are buff. The legs are bright yellow and the inner webs of its primaries are uniformly dark, unlike in the closely related spotted nothura. Behavior Like other tinamous, the white- bellied nothura eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2‚Äì3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses. Range and habitat The white-bellied nothura prefers dry shrubland regions up to in altitude. It can also be found in dry grassland, savanna, caatinga, and occasionally pastures. This species is native to northeastern and central Brazil, eastern Bolivia and Paraguay. Conservation The IUCN classifies this species as Least Concern, with an occurrence range of .

It was presented by former Monty Python member Terry Jones. It was released in 2005. Plot Terry Jones first journeys to Africa, where bones have been discovered with notches in them. However, there is no way of knowing if they were used for counting. Jones then discusses the Ishango bone, which must have been used for counting, because there are 60 scratches on each side of the bone. Jones declares this \\"the birth of one\\"; a defining moment in history of mathematics. He then journeys to Sumer. Shortly after farming had been invented and humans were starting to build houses, they started to represent 1 with a token. With this, it was possible for the first time in history to do arithmetic. The Sumerians would enclose a certain number of tokens in a clay envelope and imprint the number of tokens on the outside. However, it was realized that one could simply write the number on a clay tablet. To explore why the development of numbers occurred there and not some other place, Jones travels to Australia and meets a tribe called the Warlpiri. In their language, there are no words for numbers. When an individual is asked how many grandchildren he has, he simply replies he has \\"many\\", while he in fact has four. In Egypt, the numeral system provides a fascinating glimpse of Egyptian society, as larger numbers seem more applicable to higher strata of society. It went something like this: One was a line, ten was a rope, a hundred a coil of rope (three symbols for smaller numbers, probably applicable to the average Egyptian), a thousand a lotus (a symbol of pleasure), ten thousand was a commanding finger, and a million ‚Äì a number the Sumerians would never have dreamed of ‚Äì was the symbol of a prisoner begging for forgiveness. The Egyptians had a standard unit, the cubit, which was instrumental for building wonders such as the pyramids. Jones then journeys to Greece to cover the time of Pythagoras. Jones discusses with mathematician Marcus du Sautoy Pythagoras' obsession with numbers, his secret society, his dedication to numbers, the Pythagorean theorem, and his flawed belief that all things could be measured in units (brought down by the attempt to measure the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle, in units relative to the two legs). Archimedes was also in love with numbers. He tried to see what would happen if one took a sphere and turned it into a cylinder. This concept would later be applied to map making. Archimedes lived in Syracuse which at the time was at war with Rome. Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier while working on a mathematical problem. The Romans were not interested in mathematics for its own sake, and as a result mathematics declined. The Roman numeral system was clumsy and inefficient. One reason that Terry Jones theorizes might be was that the numerals that the Romans used were basically the old-fashioned lines of the Ishango bone. Jones discusses India's invention of a more efficient numeral system, including the invention of the concept of zero. He explains how the concept traveled west to the Caliphate. Then it arrived in Italy where it met fierce resistance. The reason for this was that most people were familiar only with the Roman numerals and not the superior Indian numerals. Eventually, the Hindu-Arabic numerals displaced the Roman ones. Jones discusses finally how Gottfried Leibniz invented the binary system, which is the foundation for modern digital computers. He planned on building a mechanical computer to use this system, but never followed through with the plan. Leibniz was convinced that 1 and 0 were the only numbers anyone really needed. In 1944, a computer called Colossus was used to crack enemy codes during World War II. Computers like Colossus evolved into modern computers, which are used for every type of number calculation.

It is one of the world's best-known premier sellers of the double-decker macaron, 15,000 of which are sold every day. The P√¢tisserie E. Ladur√©e company (soci√©t√© P√¢tisserie E. Ladur√©e) is a soci√©t√© par actions simplifi√©e (simplified joint stock corporation) and has its head office in Marcq-en-Bar≈ìul, France.\\"Legal notices.\\" Ladur√©e. Retrieved on 29 October 2012. \\"344 avenue de la Marne in Marcq en Baroeul (59700)\\" History Louis-Ernest Ladur√©e, a miller, was a prolific writer and produced works in almost every literary form including plays, poetry, novels, essays, historical and scientific works, more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets. He was an outspoken supporter of social reform, despite strict censorship laws and harsh penalties for those who broke them. As a satirical polemicist, he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma and the French institutions of his day. He founded the bakery on the Rue Royale, Paris in 1862. During the Paris Commune uprising of 1871 the bakery was burnt down. A pastry shop was built at the same location and Jules Ch√©ret was entrusted with the interior decoration. The chubby cherubs dressed as pastry cooks, painted by him on the ceiling, form the company's emblem. The interior of the premises were painted in the same celadon colour as the fa√ßade. Ladur√©e's rise to fame came in 1930 when his grandson, Pierre Desfontaines, had the original idea of the double-decker, sticking two macaron shells together with a creamy ganache as filling. Queen Catherine de' Medici had brought the macaron to France from Italy in the 16th century, and the recipe for the biscuit had hardly varied over the years, but the amounts of the ingredients used and the appearance of the end product were up to the individual bakers. Desfontaines also opened a tearoom at the pastry shop. In those days ladies were not admitted to caf√©s, which were the exclusive domain of men. This was a big success with ladies, who enjoyed meeting in the freedom of the tearoom rather than their homes. Pierre Herme was responsible for the rise of Ladur√©e. \\"In one year Ladur√©e went from a little bakery in the eighth district of Paris to a big brand name. When I arrived, there was not a lot of organization. I really brought the savoir-faire to the company. When I arrived, they didn't have a logo.\\"- Pierre Herme. Present In 1993, the Groupe Holder took over Ladur√©e. The Holder family also owns the PAUL bakery chain in France. Following the takeover, the company began an expansion drive to turn Ladur√©e from the single rue Royale bakery into a chain, setting up pastry shops and tea rooms on the Champs- √âlys√©es and in Le Printemps Haussmann in 1997, followed by Ladur√©e Bonaparte in 2002. The International development of Ladur√©e started in 2005 with London, in the Harrods department store. In 1997, two shops opened in Paris: the first on the Champs-Elys√©es, next to its tea room, decorated by Jacques Garcia, and the second in the rue Bonaparte, decorated by Roxane Rodriguez. A shop opened in 2006 in London, also decorated by Roxane Rodriguez. The takeaway models of the rue Bonaparte and Harrods stores were exported to their other locations. Ladur√©e stores are now also present in Australia, Azerbaijan, Canada, Belgium, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Monaco, Morocco, Panama, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirtes, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 2012, Ladur√©e released a makeup collection inspired by the colours of their macarons. It became available in Japan in February 2012, and in Europe from November 2012. In February 2014, Marie-H√©l√®ne de Taillac, a jewelry designer, collaborated with Ladur√©e to create sets of fashion macaron. The box containing the macarons depicts de Taillac's \\"Rainbow\\" necklace, featuring gold sequins and the piece's multicolored briolette gemstone. Ladur√©e will have Marie-H√©l√®ne de Taillac-inspired window installations in its Tokyo, Paris, and New York City stores. Culture Ladur√©e made the pastries for the film Marie Antoinette, directed by Sofia Coppola; its famous macarons can be seen in a scene between Marie Antoinette and Ambassador Mercy. They can also be seen in The CW's hit teen drama Gossip Girl as Blair Waldorf's favorite pastries. Ladur√©e regularly collaborate with fashion designers: in 2009 with Christian Louboutin, then the same year with Marni.

Russia was a 2006 court case involving Alexey Mikheyev and the Russian Federation. The case became notable as \\"the first serious victory in a case of torture\\" brought to the European Court of Human Rights against the Russian government.Police Are at War With the Russian People by Yulia Latynina \\"Phone Call to Putin: A new method that the cops love. In the war against your own people, all tactics are good.\\" , Novaya Gazeta, 9 August 2004 The case was brought forward by the Russian NGO Committee Against Torture and submitted to the European Court of Human Rights on November 16, 2001.. The applicant alleged that while in detention on remand he had been tortured by police officers in order to extract a confession to the rape and murder of a female minor. As a result, he had jumped out of the window of the police station and broken his spine. He also complained that the investigation into these events by the Russian police had been ineffective. The court's decision in this case was a judgment on January 26, 2006. The ECHR recognized that there was ill- treatment of Mikheyev, which is a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Basic Freedom. In addition, the court held that there was a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the lack of effective remedies in respect of the ill-treatment that Mikheyev complained about. ECHR held that the State should pay Mikheyev 250,000 euros in total compensation.  Case  Mikheyev (himself a traffic police officer) was falsely accused of murder (his alleged victim later turned out to be alive and well) and tortured in police custody in order to extract a confession to the alleged crime. The abuse included administering electric shocks to Mikheyev's earlobes - the torture method called \\"a phone call to Putin\\" by the torturers (). After surviving the torture, Mikheyev jumped out of a third-floor window to escape his tormentors; the fall resulted in a spinal cord injury that rendered him a paraplegic. Russia Report: February 6, 2006 by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty  Circumstances of the case  On the evening of September 8, 1998, 22-year-old traffic inspector Alexey Mikheyev of Nizhny Novgorod and his friend Ilya Frolov met in Bogorodsk with two girls: M. Savelyeva and Y. Krylova. They spent some time together riding in Mikheyev‚Äôs car, after which Krylova was taken home per her request and Savelyeva went to Nizhny Novgorod with Mikheyev and Frolov. When they were in Nizhny Novgorod, the girl asked to take her back to Bogorodsk. Mikheyev refused, since it was already late and he felt tired. Mikheyev invited the girl to spend the night at his apartment, informing her that his parents were there and she had nothing to fear. The girl refused and got out at the bus stop, saying that she would go to her acquaintances'. On September 10, 1998, the mother of M. Savelyeva submitted to the Bogorodsk City Department of Internal Affairs an application on disappearance of her minor daughter, who left home on September 8, 1998 and did not return. The same day, on suspicion of participation in the disappearance of Savelyeva, Mikheyev and Frolov were delivered to the Bogorodsk City Department of Internal Affairs, and after interrogation by investigator Naumov, they were placed in a cell. Formally, Mikheyev and Frolov have not been charged. On September 11, 1998, employees of the Bogorodsk City Department of Internal Affairs Dunaev, Naumov and Tyulchenko illegally searched Mikheyev‚Äôs apartment and car, and garages and summer cottages belonging to Mikheyev‚Äôs grandfather. The search was carried out illegally without the presence of witnesses, and the inspection of garages and cottages was not documented, and search of apartment and car in protocol is indicated as ‚Äúcrime scene inspections‚Äù to give the searches an appearance of legality. During the vehicle search, police officers allegedly seized 3 pistol cartridges. Witnesses were not present during the car inspection and were invited to sign the protocol document after the pistol cartridges were discovered. Employees of the Bogorodsk City Department of Internal Affairs considered it necessary to continue to detain Mikheyev and Frolov. There were no legal grounds for further detention, therefore, police department employees: Dunaev, Naumov and Tyulchenko falsified police reports on pending hooliganism by Mikheyev and Frolov. On September 12, based on falsified reports, Judge of the Bogorodsky District Court imposed administrative arrest on A. Mikheyev and I. Frolov for 5 days until September 11, 1998. From September 11 to 16, police officers intensely questioned Mikheev and Frolov for 10-12 hours at a time, forcing them to confess to rape and murder of Maria Savelyva and forcing them to write an admission of guilt. On September 16, Frolov was released, and a criminal case was opened against Mikheyev for storing ammunition. The reason for initiating this case was the protocol of an illegal search of Mikheyev‚Äôs car. Frolov was brought to this case as a witness. On September 16, Frolov was summoned for interrogation to the Leninsky police department, where after interrogation he was again illegally detained. After beating and threats from the deputy chief of the Nizhny Novgorod Region Department of the Internal Affairs, Pyotr Sibirev and the deputy prosecutor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, Vladimir Muravyov, he was forced to incriminate himself and admit that, together with Mikheyev, raped and killed Savelyeva. After recognition, Frolov indicated a fictitious place where he and his friend buried a corpse. On September 17-19, A. Mikheyev was exposed to intensive interrogations. Although he was detained for storing ammunition, the police interrogated him about the case of M. Savelyeva‚Äôs disappearance. On September 19, after the confession of Frolov and the unsuccessful search for a corpse, Mikheyev was subjected to torture using electric shock. Under the influence of torture and threats, Aleksey Mikheyev confessed to rape and murder of Savelyeva, after which he was offered to confess to several more unsolved murders, which he also agreed to. After receiving a confession, the police officers stopped torturing Mikheyev. Probably in a stunned state after being tortured, Mikheyev leapt from his chair and jumped out of the office window, breaking the glass with his head. Having fallen on a police motorcycle in the courtyard of the police department, Mikheyev got a severe compression fracture of spine (L-I) with a crush of spinal cord and other injuries. On the same day - September 19, 1998 - Maria Savelyeva returned home by herself.  Public inquiry  In July 1999, Aleksey Mikheyev applied to the Nizhny Novgorod Society for Human Rights for help in restoring his rights. The material was moved to Committee Against Torture, marked by the registration number \\"01\\". Thus, Mikheyev‚Äôs case became the first case to the Committee Against Torture after the registration of the Regional Public Organization ‚ÄúCommittee Against Torture‚Äù. In this case, the human rights defenders from Nizhny Novgorod uncovered a large set of illegal police activities, and in the future the case got a name as 'public inquiry into torture'. The public investigation was accompanied by the detection of many fabricated administrative and criminal cases regarding Mikheyev. The main avenues for investigation were criminal case No. 68241 (when Mikheyev fell from the window of building of the Lenin Regional Department of Internal Affairs) and criminal case No. 310503 (compiling false reports by the Bogorodsky employees of the City Department of Internal Affairs in regard to Mikheyev). Human rights defenders interviewed Mikheyev and Frolov, their relatives and friends, the patients of the hospital where Mikheyev was on treatment and reviewed the medical records of his stay. Witnesses of Mikheyev's vehicle search claimed that cartridges were removed from the car when they were absent. Moreover, Maria S. said that she had no complaints regarding Alexei Mikheyev. After receiving evidence of the torture, illegal search, and other significant violations of human rights to regard to Mikheyev, work on the case was conducted by human rights defenders in several ways at the same time. At first, the efforts of the Nizhny Novgorod Society for Human Rights and the Committee Against Torture were focused on identifying and prosecuting the persons who tortured Mikheyev in the Lenin Regional Department of Internal Affairs in Nizhny Novgorod. Secondly, human rights activists sought to prosecute police officers who fabricated administrative material in relation to Mikheyev in Bogorodsk. Also, having irrefutable evidence of Mikheyev's innocence, the Committee Against Torture also joined forces in defending Mikheev from prosecution. To represent interests and protect Mikheyev, Yuri Sidorov was provided as a lawyer. In addition, Igor Kalyapin became a representative of the interests of the victim.  Litigation in Russia  On September 21, 1998, Mikheyev's mother, Lyudmila Nikolaevna Mikheyeva, filed an application with the prosecutor's office of the Leninsky district requiring prosecution against the police officers who tortured her son. Criminal case No. 68241 was instituted on the signs of crime in accordance with Art. 110 of the Criminal Code (Incitement to Suicide) because of Mikheyev‚Äôs falling out of the window. In addition, Lyudmila Mikheyeva filed a complaint with the prosecutor of Bogorodsk complaining about the exceeding of official powers by the employees of the District Department of the Internal Affairs during his administrative arrest and search of his apartment and car. After a year and a half, in March 2000, a criminal case was opened in accordance with Art. 292 of the Criminal Code (Official Forgery) . In total, Mikheyev‚Äôs investigation took 7 years, during which it ceased more than twenty times and was illegally held at least three times. According to the Committee Against Torture, the Russian officials set a sort of an \\"anti-record\\" in regards to the inefficiency of the investigation. In the opinion of the human rights defenders, this exhausting nature of the investigation was set up to force Mikheyev to give up on fighting against injustice. In the case of Incitement to Suicide on November 30, 2005, the court sentenced Igor Somov and Nikolai Kosterin to four years in prison with deprivation of the right to take positions in a law enforcement agency for up to three years. Convicts were arrested in the courtroom. In 2009, the court sentenced the former police officers convicted in the case of Mikheyev to pay 8.5 million rubles (about 280,000 dollars in 2008) to the Russian Federation, the amount that the government paid Mikheyev at demanding of the European Court of Human Rights.  Making a complaint to the European court of human rights  The prosecutor's office of Nizhny Novgorod several times refused to investigate the case. On November 16, 2001, employees of Committee Against Torture, Yuri Sidorov and Olga Shepeleva, representatives of Alexei Mikheyev, filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights regarding a violation by the Russian Federation of Articles 3, 5, 8 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights with regard to their representative. On 1 December 2001, the complaint was registered by the Court. In parallel, there were unsuccessful attempts to achieve effective interaction with the prosecutor's office of Nizhny Novgorod. On February 26, 2003, a representative of Mikheyev submitted a request to the European Court of Human Rights to consider the complaint as priority, as Mikheyev‚Äôs health was steadily worsening. Attached to the application: copy of statement from the history of Mikheyev‚Äôs illness, the doctor‚Äôs opinion, statement of his income, the living wage in the Nizhny Novgorod region. The notice that Mikheyev‚Äôs complaint will be considered by the European Court of Human Rights as soon as possible was sent to the prosecutor of the Nizhny Novgorod region. On December 17, 2003, the commissioner of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights Pavel Laptev sent to the court the government's response memorandum. The memorandum expressed the opinion of the Russian authorities that the Court's consideration was premature as the criminal case of Mikheyev is still under investigation. = Position of the respondent government and decision of the European Court of Human Rights = The European Court of Human Rights trialed the claim in the case of Mikheyev v. Russia substantially. On January 26, 2006 the Court established that the ill-treatment in this situation achieved \\"torture level\\" per Article 3 of the Convention. Also, the court determined a violation of Article 13 of the Convention, because ‚Äúthe plaintiff was denied a fairly effective investigation and access to other remedies at his disposal including the right to compensation‚Äù. As a rule, to apply to the ECHR, the plaintiff should pass all the judiciary echelons (e.g. from district court to supreme court). The Russian authorities objected in legal proceedings due to fact that plaintiff's side did not comply with this requirement, but the court dismissed this, stating that ‚ÄúThe verdict of November 30, 2005 referred to only fact of ill-treatment and did not consider supposed faults in investigation\\". = Effects = By the decision of the European Court of Human Rights, Mikheyev was awarded a money compensation of 250,000 euros. However, journalists state that this money did not help him get back on his feet or change his residential conditions as all the money went towards paying the medical bills for Alexey's many illnesses. = Reaction of international organizations = According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, torture with electric shock is common in Russia. Torture and ill-treatment , Amnesty InternationalAmnesty International report Justice Report by Amnesty International UN Committee against Torture Must Get Commitments From Russia to Stop Torture , Human Rights WatchTorture in Russia: \\"This man-made Hell\\" , Amnesty International The Human Rights Watch wrote in a report on Russia in 1999: The Amnesty International said: The ACAT (Action des chr√©tiens pour l‚Äôabolition de la torture) organization from France reference the Mikheyev case in a report about torture in Russia, and said:  Public response  The public response to the case in early years was not prominent, because access to information for the general public was provided mainly by television and print media as opposed to the Internet. As a response to the case, in 1999 the Committee Against Torture published an article online outlining the steps to fighting the use of torture in the police. The peak of public interest in the case was in 2005-2006. In November 2005, the officers Somov and Kosterin were sentenced to real of imprisonment, and in January 2006, the ECHR awarded Mikheyev compensation in the case of Mikheyev v. Russia in amount of EUR 250,000 (total). During these years, Mikheyev's case was highlighted by print media, online publications and television. In 2004, Alexey Mikheyev was on rehabilitation in Norway. His treatment was paid by a Norwegian fund for retired policemen and a Norwegian journalist who shot a story about Alexey for a local TV channel.

The family includes eight genera and about 133 species found on the seabed in various habitats around the world. Taxonomy Echinasteridae contains eight genera and about 133 species. The two genera Echinaster and Henricia are the most speciose, forming species complexes. Echinaster has a largely tropical distribution and occurs in shallow seas including continental shelves, while Henricia is cosmopolitan, occurring mostly in cold waters, including polar habitats and abyssal locations. Aleutihenricia and Odontohenricia are native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean, in the vicinity of the Aleutian Islands. Characteristics Echinasterids are mostly five- armed starfish with thick but small discs, and long, slender, often cylindrical arms. The cuticle is covered on both the aboral (upper) and oral (lower) surfaces by a latticework of ossicles which are either flattened or rounded plates, or pseudopaxilliform (peglike) plates with broad bases. The mouth is surrounded by tight-fitting triangular plates. The pores through which the tube feet project are small and the plates on either side of the ambulacral grooves are angular and bear spines. Echinasterids do not have pedicellariae. Ecology Echinasterids are epifaunal animals that live on the seabed, on rock, sand, gravel or mud. They graze on encrusting invertebrates such as sponges, tunicates and molluscs, as well as feeding on detritus. Additionally, Echinaster uses cilia to create a current to draw zooplankton and organic particles into its mouth. Henricia is a scavenger and a filter feeder. The sexes are separate in these starfish. The eggs are large and yolky and development is by way of brachiolaria larvae. In some species these are planktonic, but in others, the females brood their young in a brood chamber under their arms. Echinaster luzonicus is renowned for shedding its arms in a process known as autotomy, being then able to regenerate a new disc from a single arm. This is a form of asexual reproduction and E. luzonicus is not known to reproduce in any other way. Another echinasterid that reproduces asexually is Henricia sexradiata, but in this case, the disc also splits apart.

He was a nephew of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. Born in Imperial Russia during the reign of his uncle, Prince Nikita escaped the fate of many of his relatives who were killed by the Bolsheviks. He left Russia in April 1919, at age nineteen. In 1922, he married Countess Maria Vorontsova-Dashkova. The couple had two children. Russian prince Prince Nikita Alexandrovich was born in Saint Petersburg at his parents' palace at 106, Moika street.Kiste & Hall, Once a Grand Duchess, p. 51 He was the son of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia. Through his mother he was a grandson of Tsar Alexander III of Russia and his consort, the Tsarina Maria Feodorovna of Russia (born Princess Dagmar of Denmark). Prince Nikita spent his childhood and adolescence in fabulous splendor under the reign of his uncle, Tsar Nicholas II. He also traveled with his parents through Europe. A favorite destination was Ai-Todor, his father's estate, located in Crimea on the shores of the Black Sea. It was there where Prince Nikita and his immediate family found refuge from the disturbances in the former Imperial capital after the fall of the monarchy in Russia in February 1917. For a time, they lived there undisturbed. Their situation deteriorated after the Bolsheviks rose to power. Prince Nikita was placed under house arrest with his parents and other members of the Romanov family in Crimea for sometime. He left Russia on 11 April 1919 with the help of his great aunt Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom (formerly Princess Alexandra of Denmark), a sister of the Dowager Tsarina Maria. King George V sent the British warship HMS Marlborough, which brought Prince Nikita's family and other members of the Romanov dynasty, headed by the Dowager Tsarina Maria Feodorovna, from the Crimea over the Black Sea to Malta and then to England. Exile During his first years in exile Prince Nikita lived in Paris in the house of his sister Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia. He moved later to England where he graduated from Oxford University. During his student years, Prince Nikita was president of the Oxford University Russian Club. Prince Nikita Alexandrovich married a childhood friend: Countess Maria Vorontsova- Dashkova (13 February 1903 in Tsarskoye Selo, Russia ‚Äì 15 June 1997 in Cannes, France) in Paris, France. Well known by White Russians in exile for her elegance and grace, the Princess was a daughter of Count Hilarion Vorontsov Illarionovich - Dashkov and his first wife, Irina, born Naryshkina. Maria was a direct descendant of several Russian noble families, including Dolgorukov, Naryshkin, and Shuvalov. The wedding took place on 19 February 1922 in Paris. The couple had two sons: *Prince Nikita Romanov (13 May 1923 in London, England ‚Äì 3 May 2007 in New York City) *Prince Alexander Romanov (4 November 1929 in Paris, France ‚Äì 21 September 2002 in London, England). In the early 1920s in Paris, the Princess, with her husband's helped to create a collection for the company IRFE owned by Prince Felix Yusupov and his wife Princess Irina Alexandrovna, Nikita's sister. After the birth of his youngest son, Prince Nikita moved his family from Paris to England where his mother, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna lived. In exile, Nikita Alexandrovich was an active in the monarchist movement. He was a member of the oldest monarchist organization, the Supreme Monarchist Council. He was particularly involved during the 1920s and 1930s. At the outbreak World War II, Prince Nikita was living in Paris with his family. Unable to return to London, they moved to Rome and later to Czechoslovakia. As the Red Army advanced on the Eastern Front, fearing to end up in Soviet-occupied territory, the family moved back to Paris. When the war ended, they emigrated to the United States in 1946 settling in Monterey, California where Prince Nikita Alexandrovich taught Russian in army units. He later moved to New York city, working in banks and offices. Prince Nikita Alexandrovich never recognized the rights to the throne of Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia, and in 1959, he publicly dismissed Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich's claims to the vacant Russian throne. Throughout his life, Prince Nikita Aleksandrovich did not adopt any nationality, he decided to remain only Russian. In the early 1970s, Prince Nikita Alexandrovich and his wife returned to France. He died in 1974 in Cannes. He had wished to be buried in Ai-Todor in Crimea, but was buried in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, next to his parents.

Fado has been described as the Portuguese expression of 'the blues,' and fado roughly means fate. Biography Maria Severa Onofriana was born in Lisbon, Portugal, in the neighborhood of Madragoa in 1820. She was the daughter of Severo Manuel and Ana Gertrudes. Her mother was the owner of a tavern and had the nickname A Barbuda (\\"the bearded woman\\"). Severa is said to have been a tall and gracious courtesan, and would sing the fado in taverns where she would also play the Portuguese guitar. She is known to have had several lovers, including Francisco de Paula Portugal e Castro, 13th Count of Vimioso, who took her to bullfights (a public and important social event of that time). She died of tuberculosis on November 30, 1846, on Rua do Capel√£o in Mouraria, Lisbon, only 26 years old, and was buried in a common grave in the cemetery of Alto de S√£o Jo√£o.  In popular culture  Maria Severa's fame grew also due to a novel by J√∫lio Dantas, entitled A Severa, which was then made into a play and that was brought to stage in 1901. In 1931, director Leit√£o de Barros turned the play into the first Portuguese film to feature sound, A Severa.

Annabouboula first released records and performed in the 1980s and 1990s. Musical influences and style According to its creator, producer Christopher Lawrence, Annabouboula originally was an experiment in applied cultural anthropology. Lawrence wanted to use contemporary New York musicians to record traditional Greek folk music and older Greek popular music as a way to encourage contemporary Greek rock musicians to create new hybrids rather than slavishly imitate non-Greek styles. In late 1985, he recruited Anna Paidoussi, an operatically trained Greek-American singer who was familiar with modern Greek music, to be the Anna for an act he dubbed Annabouboula, which is a Greek expression that means noisy confusion. WIth Anna's vocal abilities in mind, Lawrence and co-producer Sempepos selected existing songs and also composed new songs, which were derived from the repertoire of the indigenous Greek genres rembetiko, laika and dhimotika; the band would then set about re-arranging the songs to use contemporary sounds and rhythms associated with contemporary New York synthpop, experimental and post-new wave scenes. In the late 1980s, Annabouboula was one of the first American-based acts that could be categorized as world music or world beat, terms that were first gaining currency at that time. The liner notes of the Shanachie release of In the Baths of Constantinople say, \\"What [it] did was take a traditional belly dance and rembetiko music (smokey Greek blues) and electrify them, adding a funky rhythm and a wild psychedelic undertow to these dark and moody songs of passion and heartbreak.\\"Liner notes by Brian Cullman, eponymous LP, Annabouboula, Shanachie 64022. A review at Allmusic.com says, \\"[It] combines traditional Greek belly-dance music with elements of rock, hip-hop and dance music\\" and says of Anna Paidoussi that she may have been raised in the US, but that doesn't stop her from singing passionately in Greek on both originals and daring interpretations of classic Greek rembetiko and bouzouki songs. History The group's initial recordings in New York City included contributions from musicians Bond Bergland, Hearn Gadbois and Chris Cunningham, who later formed their own group called The Saqqara Dogs. These early recordings, especially the track \\"Hamam\\", an original song based in part on the \\"Rembetiko\\" standard ŒúŒµœÇ Œ§Œ∑œÇ Œ†œåŒªŒπœÇ Œ§Œø ŒßŒ±ŒºŒ¨Œº (In The Baths Of Constantinople) re-mixed by New York-based Swiss producer Roli Mosimann, caught the attention of Greek radio deejay Giannis Petridis, who enabled its release as an extended-play maxi-single on the Virgin Greece record label in 1986. Chris Lawrence personally imported copies of the maxi-single and sent them around to radio and club deejays in the U.S. Subsequently Sempepos, Lawrence and Paidoussi recorded more material working as a studio act with occasional guest collaborators, such as John Linnell of They Might Be Giants. In 1987 Virgin Records in the U.K. distributed a full-length vinyl LP called \\"Hamam\\" that included most of these early recordings; In 1990 this LP was licensed by Shanachie Records and released in the U.S. with the title In The Baths of Constantinople on CD and vinyl. Meanwhile, a second LP was recorded by the trio and mixed by New York hip-hop producer Paul C (Paul C. McKasty). Most of this material was released in Greece on the BMG label as a vinyl L.P. with the title \\"Œ¶ŒøœÑŒπŒ¨ /Burn Down The Coffee House\\" in 1989. In 1991, after extensive overdubbing and re-mixing, this material was released in the U.S. on CD only by Shanachie Records with the title Greek Fire. In 1990, in anticipation of the American release of its two albums, Annabouboula created a live performing act that included Anna Paidoussi on vocals, George Sempepos on guitar, George Stathos on electric clarinet, and Peter Basil on percussion. This group's first appearance was on the U.S. television show Night Music With David Sanborn ( Sunday Night (American TV program) ). Soon afterwards the group started performing in the U.S. and Canada with additional members Wil Hinds on bass and Akis Perdikis on drums. Later members included Richard Bennett on keyboards and Oren Freed or Tom Schmidt on drums. From 1991 to 1994, in addition to maintaining Annbouboula as a live act, Paidoussi, Sempepos, and Lawrence continued working as a studio trio to record new material; however after the group's last performances in 1993 Annabouboula effectively went into hibernation for 15 years, during which time only one song was released, for inclusion on the charity CD Balkans Without Borders (1999). In 2008 the group resumed working on the album it had started recording, overdubbing and adding new material. Most of the music accompanying Paidoussi's vocals was performed by Sempepos with contributions from members of The ByzanTones, a group he assembled to perform instrumental surf music with Greek and Middle Eastern influences. In 2010, this album was completed and released on Sempepos' own label, Byzan-Tone Records, with the title Immortal Water. The title song is an adaptation of an Asia Minor Greek folk song \\"Aidinikos Dance\\" as recorded in the 1920s by Greek-American singer Marika Papagika.

It was a low-wing cabin monoplane with twin piston engines and a tailwheel undercarriage. Development The Ki-77 was the Japanese Army Air Force designation for the A-26, a clean, slim low wing twin engine monoplane intended for an endurance flight between New York and Tokyo. The A stood for the name of the sponsor, a newspaper Asahi Shimbun which was vying for records with a rival paper that had sponsored the Mitsubishi Ki-15 Kamikaze flight to the United Kingdom in 1937. 26 was for the 26th century of the Japanese Imperial Dynasty - 1940 was year 2600 in the Japanese calendar. The Ki-77's overall design was developed under the aegis of Dr. Hidemasa Kimura of the Aeronautical Research Institute of the University of Tokyo, with Tachikawa Aircraft Company being responsible for manufacturing and detail drafting work. The aircraft's layout was finalized in autumn of 1940 with its first flight originally expected in late 1941, but this was canceled with the start of war against the United States and consequent reallocation of priorities. The Ki-77 design included a number of novel features, including a high aspect ratio laminar flow wing for reduced drag, a sealed but unpressurized cabin to reduce the need for oxygen masks at its intended operating altitude, and special low drag cowlings. Flight from Japan to Germany In response to a flight made by an Italian Savoia-Marchetti S.M.75GA which flew to Japan in July 1942 with stops in Russia and China, the Japanese decided to forge a link with Europe, but wished to avoid Soviet-controlled airspace. The easiest route was that taken by the Italians, following the great circle route, but General Tojo opposed this because it implied a violation of Soviet airspace. Japan was not at war with the Soviets and Tojo wished to avoid either provoking them or asking their permission. Development work was restarted on the A-26/Ki-77 project, and the first of two prototypes flew on 18 November 1942. The prototype suffered from persistent oil cooling problems which required many changes before being solved, delaying further flights into July 1943; while working on these engineering issues, Tachikawa built a second aircraft. Colonel Saigo considered the so-named \\"Seiko\\" (Success) mission absurd and suicidal, but the crew was aware of the hazards of the mission; they even had a personal dose of poison to kill themselves if forced down in enemy territory. The pilot was Juukou Nagatomo, the co-pilot was Hajime Kawasaki, Kenji Tsukagoshi and Noriyoshi Nagata were flight engineers, and Motohiko Kawashima was the radio operator. Three Army officers were also carried as passengers, two of whom were military attach√©s. They departed Japan on 30 June 1943 for Singapore, where the airstrip had to be lengthened by 1,000 meters to assure a safe takeoff. Finally, the aircraft took off at 7:10 on 7 July 1943 with eight tons of fuel, ample to reach Europe. Their intended destination was the German airfield at Sarabus (now Hvardiiske, Crimea, .) but they were to disappear over the Indian Ocean. British fighters likely intercepted them as they were aware of the flight and its route (via air grid squares 3420, 2560 and 2510) thanks to the ULTRA analysts at Bletchley Park decoding intercepted German communications to Sarabus warning of their impending arrival. Slow, unarmed, without armour protection and with a substantial amount of fuel on board, the Ki-77 would have been vulnerable to Allied fighters, even had no mechanical problems occurred. Endurance record flight Japan carried out a second flight to gain an endurance record and to verify the Ki-77's capabilities. The existing record had been held by Italy's Savoia-Marchetti SM.75GA since 1939. Captured Ki-77 aboard Even if the usefulness of record breaking flights was overshadowed in 1944 by the necessities of war, the Japanese needed a propaganda coup and the surviving Ki-77 was available. On 2 July it flew 19 circuits over a triangular route off Manchuria, landing 57 hours 9 minutes later and covering at an average speed of , more than the SM.75's record. The Ki-77 landed with 800 liters remaining in the tanks of the it began with, so the maximum endurance was around . The Ki-77's endurance record was first exceeded in October 1946 by a Lockheed P2V-1 Neptune in a flight from Perth, Australia to Columbus, Ohio in the American midwest, of over . None of these records were internationally recognized or officiated by the FAI. The distance record Ki-77 aircraft was still in existence when Japan surrendered and was shipped to the United States aboard the United States Navy escort carrier from Yokosuka in December 1945, arriving at Alameda, California on 8 January 1946 for examination before being scrapped.

Early life  Burrell was the son of Peter Burrell of Kelseys, Beckenham, Kent and his wife Isabella Merrik, second daughter of John Merrik, and older brother of Sir Merrick Burrell, 1st Baronet. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School from 1704 to 1707. He became a merchant in trade with Portugal. On 14 March 1723, he married Amy Raymond, daughter of Hugh Raymond.  Career  Burrell was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for Haslemere in a contest at the 1722 British general election. He voted with the Government, except on the excise bill, which he opposed. He was sub-governor of the South Sea Company from 1724 to 1733 and a Director of Exchange Assurance from 1726 to 1738. He was returned unopposed at the 1727 British general election. In 1730 he introduced a bill, which became law, allowing South Carolina to send rice direct to Southern Europe. He was High Sheriff of Kent for the year 1732 to 1733. At the 1734 British general election he was returned unopposed again. In 1737 he was one of the main speakers against Sir John Barnard's scheme for reducing the interest on the national debt. In 1741 he supported a bill to regulate insurance. On the outbreak of war with Spain he secured a contract for remitting money for the forces in Jamaica, in partnershwith John Bristow, with whom he also shared similar contracts for Gibraltar and Minorca. He was returned again at the 1741 British general election. After the fall of Walpole in 1742, the Jamaican contract was severely criticized by the secret committee set up by the House of Commons to inquire into Walpole's Administration. He was included in the Treasury list of underwriters of a loan in 1744, taking ¬£90,000. He spoke for the Government in a debate on supply on 22 February 1744. Burrell was defeated at Haslemere at the 1754 British general election. A further shock in 1754 was the earthquake at Lisbon which damaged his business there. He was returned in a by-election on 9 April 1755 as MP for Dover on Newcastle's recommendation. Death and legacy Burrell died on 16 April 1756, leaving four sons and two daughters. His oldest son Peter represented Launceston and Totnes in the British House of Commons, while his third son William was also returned for Haslemere and succeeded later his father-in-law as baronet.

Its call sign was the . History The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) 40th Division was raised as a triangular division on 30 June 1939 in Zentsuji, Kagawa prefecture, simultaneously with 38th, 39th and 41st divisions. Its manpower came primarily from the four prefectures of Shikoku island. Although intended as a garrison force to maintain public order and to cover police duties in Japanese-occupied portions of China, due to the deteriorating situation in the Second Sino- Japanese War it was quickly assigned to front-line combat duties. The 40th Division was initially assigned to the Eleventh Army on 2 October 1939 and was stationed from Hankou to Guangji along the banks of the Yangtze River, then the Xianning city in Hubei area. It was involved in combat during the Battle of Zaoyang-Yichang from 1 May 1940, Central Hubei Operation in November 1940, and the Battle of South Henan from February 1941. The fighting continued in the Second Battle of Changsha in September 1941 and Third Battle of Changsha from December 1941. In April 1942, the 40th Division was one of the units assigned to capturing the downed American airmen of the Doolittle Mission in what came to be known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign. From February 1943, the 40th division has started to participate in the offensive toward Chongqing. Nonetheless, in March 1943, the 40th mountain artillery regiment was renamed as 31st mountain artillery regiment and sent to reinforce 31st Division (Imperial Japanese Army) in ill-fated Battle of Kohima. The lost regiment was never replaced. From April 1944, it was assigned to Operation Ichi-go, reaching Yiyang 10 June 1944, and stopping in coastal Haojiang District 9 July 1944. In January 1945, the 40th Division was assigned to guard the Guangdong‚ÄìHankou Railway. During that period the divisional headquarters were in Qujiang District, Shaoguan. Afterwards, it came under the command of the Twenty-Third Army and stationed in the Guangdong-Macau area to counter anticipated landings by Allied forces. However, as American forces invaded Okinawa in April 1945, the 40th Division received orders to withdraw from Guangdong to Shanghai. En route, while in Nanchang, Jiangxi province, the war came to an end. The 40th Division's final orders were to withdraw from Nanchang to Nanjing, where it was demobilized, and its surviving troops were returned to Sasebo, Japan by May 1946.

Heino Wilhelm Daniel Kaski (21 June 1885, Pielisj√§rvi - 20 September 1957, Helsinki) was a Finnish composer, teacher and pianist. Kaski was born in Pielisj√§rvi into a cantor's family. His father taught him the violin, and was generally supportive: when Kaski dropped out of secondary school to study music full-time in Helsinki, he did not object. Kaski first studied at the Helsinki Cantor-Organist school, then entered the Philharmonic's Orchestra School. There, he continued studying the violin, but was also tutored in theory (by Ilmari Krohn) and composition (by Erkki Melartin). In 1911, on Jean Sibelius' recommendation, Kaski received a grant that enabled him to study for four years in Berlin, under Paul Juon. In 1914 he returned to Finland; one of his larger works, Symphony in B minor, was composed in 1914-1919 under partial guidance from Selim Palmgren. The symphony was performed on October 2, 1919. The same year, Kaski went to Europe again, to study under Otto Taubmann in Berlin, and then travelled and studied in Italy and France. He finally returned to Finland in 1924, and since then worked as music teacher in various schools. He gave nine composition concerts and in 1950 was awarded the Pro Finlandia medal. On 20 September 1957, aged 72, Kaski died in Helsinki. His death was overshadowed by that of Jean Sibelius, who died the same day, at the age of 91. He is buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki. Kaski is best known for his piano miniatures (which number over one hundred), in which he displays a natural gift for melody, and for his songs (similarly more than one hundred of them), although he also authored numerous chamber works, four orchestral suites, and many other pieces.

(2007) Taxonomy This is a monotypic species. All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Habitats The lesser nothura inhabits lowland the dry grassland habitats of subtropical or tropical regions at an altitude range of .BirdLife International (2008) This tinamou can also be found in dry shrubland and savanna. It doesn't seem to like recently burned grasslands. Range The lesser nothura is found in parts of southeastern BrazilClements, J. (2007) and recently in one location in east-central Paraguay. It has been found in Brasilia National Park, IBGE Roncador Biological Reserve, and Taguatinga in the Federal District, Emas National Park and Luzi√¢nia in Goi√°s and Serra da Canastra National Park and Serra do Cip√≥ National Park in Minas Gerais, Itapetininga Experimental Station and Itirapina Experimental Station in S√£o Paulo, and at Laguna Blanca, San Pedro department. Description The lesser nothura is approximately in length. The lesser nothura is rufescent with a chestnut crown and yellow mottling. Its face is buff, shades of yellow on its throat and dark brown spots turning to streaks at its breast. Its flanks have brown markings and its underparts are chestnut with rufous barring, its wings are rufous with dusky barring. Its legs are yellow, and its bill is black, and it has brown irises. Behavior Its voice consists of long, high-pitched whistles. It probably breeds between October and February. Conservation The IUCN has classified this species as vulnerable due to the fragmentation of its population and the loss of its primary habitat. It has an occurrence range of and a 2000 estimate of adult birds placed it at around 9000, which may be a little liberal. The habitats inhabited by lesser nothura are being rapidly destroyed by mechanised agriculture, intensive cattle-ranching, afforestation, invasive grasses, excessive use of pesticides and annual burning. By 1993, two-thirds of the Cerrado region had been heavily or moderately altered, with most of the destruction having occurred since 1950. Farming, ranching, fires, and pesticide are the practices that have the most impact on this species. The lesser nothura is protected under Brazilian law, and conserved in Bras√≠lia National Park, Emas National Park and Serra da Canastra National Park, IBGE Roncador Biological Reserve, Itapetininga Experimental Station and Itirapina Experimental Station. It has been proposed to survey suitable habitat in Serra do Cip√≥ National Park and Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, using tape- playback. It was also proposed to identify other unprotected areas of suitable habitat in north-eastern Paraguay, north and west Minas Gerais, and Goi√°s.

He is seen as one of the most brilliant later pupils of Arnold Schoenberg.  Life  A member of the Saxon community in Transylvania, Hannenheim was born in the city of Nagyszeben (in German: Hermannstadt, present-day Sibiu). He visited the German High School in Hermannstadt and received private piano lessons. Hannenheim occupied himself with music since his childhood and occasionally wrote compositions as an autodidact. In 1916 he was scheduled to perform a movement of his piano sonata, but recruitment into the army prevented this. From his early times date some tonalic settings of poems, which he partly published himself. He studied in Graz, Austria, from 1922 to 1923, and subsequently with Paul Graener in Leipzig. Here he composed pieces of chamber music for different ensembles, pieces for orchestra, one concerto for violin with chamber orchestra, one concerto for violoncello with chamber orchestra, one symphony for big orchestra in one movement and a concerto for big orchestra. In 1925, in the competition for the \\"George Enescu-Preis\\", Hannenheim won the \\"Zweiten Nationalpreis f√ºr Komposition\\" (\\"Second national prize for composition\\"). The piece, which was performed, was the first of six sonatas for violin, composed in this year. It remained characteristic of Hannenheim, that he liked to write several pieces for the same instrument or ensemble nearly simultaneously. In 1928/29 he continued his composition studies with Alexander Jemnitz in Budapest. Hannenheim was then a pupil in Schoenberg's Master Class in Composition at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin (1929 to 1932). Schoenberg regarded him highly, calling him \\"one of the most interesting personalities I have ever met\\". Perhaps Schoenberg was particularly impressed by Hannenheim, because \\"he was nearly the only one, who would contradict him\\" (Erich Schmid). Hannenheim was a prolific composer and espoused the twelve-note technique even as a student. His works were performed at concerts in the Akademie der K√ºnste (for example, he conducted the premiere of a Symphony in a concert devoted to Schoenberg's pupils on 20 May 1930 ‚Äî it shared the programme with works by his fellow-students Winfried Zillig and Nikos Skalkottas). He composed many pieces at this time, but had big problems, earning enough money to live on. In 1932 he won the \\"Mendelssohn Staatspreis\\". In the same year he had a nervous breakdown, from which he soon recovered. His \\"2. piano concerto with small orchestra\\" in one movement was very successful and was broadcast by many radio stations all over the world. Together with other colleagues, he won the \\"Emil Hertzka-Preis\\" in 1933. The \\"Dritte Reich\\" ended his career. He had only few concerts. But works of his were performed as a ‚ÄúRoumanian‚Äù composer, at pre-World War II ISCM Festivals (as a Romanian composer, since the ISCM was formally proscribed by the Nazi German musical authorities). Now he turned to arrangements of folk music. From the beginning of the Second World War, we know very little about Hannenheim. It was long believed that Hannenheim perished in an Allied air raid on Berlin and that all his scores were destroyed, but numerous songs, piano sonatas and string quartets have come to light in recent years. And it now appears that Hannenheim, who had intermittent but acute psychological problems, was admitted into a German psychiatric hospital in Berlin in 1944 and then into the Euthanasia hospital Obrawalde near Miƒôdzyrzecz (today Poland). He survived the Nazi regime, but died some four months after the war ended, from heart disease (according to the death certificate).  Work  Hannenheim did register about 80 pieces for voice and piano at the \\"Genossenschaft Deutscher Tonsetzer\\". He used poems of artists like Rainer Maria Rilke, Friedrich H√∂lderlin, Max Dauthendey, Otto Erich Hartleben, Hermann Hesse, Friedrich Nietzsche, Christian Morgenstern, Rudolf G. Binding, Arno Holz. Only 45 out of more than 230 pieces, are known today. The others were destroyed in the chaos of the war's end, are forgotten or were burned under delusion by Hannenheim himself.

Then-President of the Chamber Severino Cavalcanti was expected to end debate and bring the bill to a vote in late 2005, but corruption charges forced his resignation. Despite the anticipated vote, Calvalcanti strongly opposed the bill. In 2012, the bill was introduced into the Senate by Suplicy, who was elected in 2011 to a seat in the Senate. On May 24, 2012, it was passed by the Senate's human rights committee. It will face another vote before the Senate's Committee on Constitution, Justice and Citizenship, with a subsequent vote in the Chamber of Deputies if no action is taken by the plenary of the Senate. The bill's chances for a full congressional vote have been heightened since the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled in ADI 4277 and ADPF 132 (May 2011) that civil unions should be allowed for same-sex couples.

Geography The Montezuma Hills are located in southern Solano County, California. They are bounded by the Sacramento River on the south and east, the Montezuma Slough on the west, and roughly by California State Route 12 on the north. Rio Vista is the nearest city, and Travis Air Force Base is about 10 miles northwest of the Montezuma Hills. They are north across the Sacramento River from Antioch and Pittsburg, and 40 miles (64 km) northeast of San Francisco. The summits of these rolling hills vary in height from about . The hills are known for their exceptional wind energy resource potential which has made them the site of the rapidly expanding Shiloh Wind Power Plant, a wind farm that now comprises hundreds of wind turbines, with another 88 pending approval. Natural features Aerial view (facing east) The flora and fauna of the Montezuma Hills has been studied extensively beginning in 1988 with the Earth Metrics Environmental Impact Report for proposed wind energy development.\\"Montezuma Hills Avian and Bat Assessment\\", 2006, Estep and Jones & Stokes\\"Environmental Impact Report for the Montezuma Hills Wind Farm\\", 1988, Earth Metrics, published by the Solano County Department of Environmental Management, Fairfield, California and continuing with subsequent analyses\\"Wind Turbine Effects on Avian Activity, Habitat Use, and Mortality in Altamont Pass and Montezuma Hills\\", 1993, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Prepared for the California Energy Commission\\"Solano County High Winds Power Project Environmental Impact Report\\", 2002, Environmental Science Associates\\"Biological Resources Report and Evaluation for the Proposed Shiloh Wind Plant Project\\", Solano County, Ca. that collectively have led to a compreshensive characterization of the local biological resources, plant communities and wildlife habitat. In general there is little remaining native vegetation in the Montezuma Hills due to the historic intensive grazing. As of 2010, land uses are primarily dryland farming, sheep grazing, and energy, including natural gas production ‚Äì the Rio Vista Gas Field underlies much of the Montezuma Hills ‚Äì and wind energy. Wetlands cover only a small percentage of the Montezuma Hills, and virtually all of the sparse trees are non-native species associated with the area's farming homesteads. Compared to the Suisun Marsh to the south and west, the Montezuma Hills have a relatively unabundant diversity of birds and other wildlife. Among the Montezuma Hills are a number of intermittent drainage swales that flow during winter months; otherwise the monotypic dryland farms support even less diversity of wildlife than more agriculturally diverse land uses to the north. Exceptions to the dearth of wildlife are the considerable populations of ground squirrels and other small rodents, which populations in turn support modest numbers of raptors. Birds present in moderate numbers are the red-winged blackbird, cliff swallow, northern harrier and barn swallow. Moderate numbers of avian nests have been documented in the Montezuma Hills including red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and historic nests of the golden eagle.

It operates over a section of track that was part of the East Coast Main Trunk Railway until the Kaimai Tunnel deviation made it redundant in 1978. The Goldfields Railway was formed in 1980 as the Goldfields Steam Train Society to retain a portion of the old main line and switched to its current name in the mid- nineties.Goldfields Railway - About Us  History of the line  The route currently used by the Goldfields Railway was originally built through the Karangahake Gorge as the Waihi Branch from Paeroa on the Thames Branch to provide rail access to the significant mining activity that was then taking place in the Waihi area. It was not intended to be a main line, but after extensive surveys and a few false starts, it became part of the East Coast Main Trunk to Tauranga, Te Puke, and ultimately Taneatua in 1928. This route was circuitous, thus making it less appealing than more direct road routes, but traffic nonetheless grew as Tauranga's port increased in importance and the Karangahake Gorge route lacked sufficient capacity. Accordingly, a new route was required and the direct Kaimai Tunnel deviation was built, opening on 12 September 1978. The Karangahake Gorge route was closed and dismantled in the 1980s, except for the 6 kilometres between Waihi and Waikino, which the Goldfields Railway saved.Goldfields Railway - Heritage  The preserved line  In Waihi, much of the infrastructure of the station and yard remains intact and preserved; although some freight-related structures such as the livestock yards are gone, the goods shed, six railway houses, and small ancillary buildings remain, and the main station buildings are protected and recognised by Heritage New Zealand and the Rail Heritage Trust.Goldfields Railway - The History of Waihi Station The line to Waikino is 6 km long and includes a few bridges, including the only private railway bridge over a state highway in New Zealand. In Waikino, the station is not the original one built on the site; it was formerly Paeroa's station and was transferred to Waikino in 1990, just before the mothballing and eventual closure of the railway through Paeroa to Thames in 1991. The station is now used as a cafe and to link the railway with a walkway through the Karangahake Gorge and other local attractions.Goldfields Railway - About Us  Locomotives  The Goldfields Railway possesses a variety of locomotives, primarily small diesel locomotives used in private industry or for shunting on the national network. The locomotives include:Goldfields Railway - Image Gallery *Baguley-Drewry diesel locomotive, built 1968 *Peckett steam locomotive, built 1938 *Price petrol locomotive, built 1944 *TR class diesel locomotive, built 1948 *TR class diesel locomotive, also built 1948 but with different cab design These locomotives are augmented by a collection of velocipedes and motor trolleys that are primarily used for track inspection and maintenance. The railway has also been visited by steam locomotives owned by others. During Easter 2006, as part of celebrations to mark over 100 years of the railway in Waihi, Y 542 owned by the Museum of Transport and Technology was brought to operate trips on the Goldfields Railway.Goldfields Railway - Celebrating 100 Years of Rail Image Gallery  Rolling stock  The Goldfields Railway's collection of rolling stock consists of both passenger carriages and freight wagons.

City of Las Vegas, 478 F.3d 1048 (9th Cir. 2007), was a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined whether a Las Vegas, Nevada police officer utilized excessive force when making an arrest.Davis v. City of Las Vegas, 478 F.3d 1048, 1051 (9th Cir. 2007). Background and Opinion of the Court On November 7, 2001, Frankie Davis was handcuffed by security at the Las Vegas Club Hotel & Casino after he was found in an area of the casino that was not open to the public.Davis, 478 F.3d at 1051. When a police officer, David Miller, arrived, Davis refused to consent to a search; at that point, Miller then \\"slammed [Davis] head-first into a wall several times, pinned him against the floor, and punched him in the face.\\"Davis, 478 F.3d at 1051 (Davis \\"remained handcuffed throughout his encounter\\" and \\"was unarmed at all times\\"). As a result of these actions, Davis suffered a broken neck.Davis, 478 F.3d at 1051. left Davis filed a lawsuit, arguing that Miller's excessive use of force violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, but the officer alleged that he was entitled to qualified immunity.Davis, 478 F.3d at 1051 (Davis filed the lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983). The United States District Court for the District of Nevada granted Miller's motion for summary judgment based on his qualified immunity claim, but on appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed.Davis, 478 F.3d at 1051, 1058. In an opinion written by Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt, the Court held that Miller was not entitled to qualified immunity because \\"any reasonable officer\\" in the same position would have known that \\"swinging a handcuffed man into a wall head-first multiple times and then punching him in the face while he lay face-down on the ground, and breaking his neck as a result, was unnecessary and excessive.\\"Davis, 478 F.3d at 1057 (internal citations omitted). Commentary and analysis In its summary of the case, the McQuillin Municipal Law Report stated that the Court \\"had no question\\" that the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity.25 No. 4 6. University of Georgia School of Law professor Michael L. Wells argued that in Davis, the Ninth Circuit assumed a role \\"between judge and jury\\" by making an independent assessment of the \\"reasonableness\\" of the officer's actions.Michael L. Wells, Scott v. Harris and the Role of the Jury in Constitutional Litigation, 29 65, 120 (2009). In the Ninth Circuit's 2010 opinion in Luchtel v. Hagemann, the court cited Davis as a case that affirmed the \\"continuing viability\\" of circuit precedent that recognized \\"causing fractures and dislocating shoulders while handcuffing a suspect is excessive force.\\"Luchtel v.

SMC was founded on November 9, 1994 under the philosophy of ‚Äúcontributing to improving the nation‚Äôs health through the best medical service, advanced medical research, and development of outstanding medical personnel.\\" Since its foundation, Samsung Medical Center has successfully incorporated and developed an advanced model with the motto of becoming a \\"patient-centered hospital\\". The center, called by media \\"no. 1 in the nation\\", has been criticized for its poor handling of the MERS outbreak.  Facilities  Samsung Medical Center consists of a hospital and a cancer center. The hospital is located in an intelligent building with floor space of more than 200,000 square meters and 20 floors above ground and 5 floors underground, housing 40 departments, 10 specialist centers, 120 special clinics, and 1,306 beds. On the other hand, the 655-bed Cancer Center has 11 floors above ground and 8 floors underground, with floor space of over 100,000 square meters. SMC is a tertiary hospital manned by approximately 7,400 staff including over 1,200 doctors and 2,300 nurses. Since SMC was opened in 1994, SMC has become Korea's representative medical institution. It has provided medical treatments for 16 million outpatients, and SMC is giving treatments to an average of 8,000 patients daily. SMC is leading to make further developments in the medical field in Korea and is planning to build the Samsung International Medical Center by 2015. In March 2010, SMC announced the project to become a ‚Äúglobally leading‚Äù hospital in the medical market. Equipped with advanced medical service infrastructure including outstanding medical staff, order communication system (OCS), picture archiving communication system (PACS), clinical pathology automation system, and logistics automation system, SMC is defining a new hospital culture in Korea by being the best hospital in terms of hi-tech medical services and through the provision of genuine patient-centered medical services (shortest waiting time, hospital that does not require guardians).  Educational units  Since March 1997 when it was established to train the students of Sungkyunkwan University's School of Medicine, the Samsung Medical Center has admitted 40 of the nation's top students each year. As a teaching hospital for the Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, the Hospital autonomously trains and nurtures clinical instructors and medical specialists. SMC provides EBM (Evidence-Based Medicine) education, Korea's first PBL (Problem-Based Learning) education, medical English education, lectures in cultural studies, PDR (Patient-Doctor Relationship) education for doctors that teaches the ways to communicate effectively with patients, and professional nurse training systems with a combination of theoretical an practitioners. Hence, SMC is recognized as a medical institute producing the best-skilled personal in the field of medicine. To ensure its further growth, the Samsung Medical Center opened the Samsung Cancer Center and Samsung Cancer Lab in 2008 and 2009, respectively; it is set to open the Samsung International Medical Center in 2016.  Research  Through innovative achievements in advanced medicine, SMC is developing medical science. With the Research Center for Future Medicine, SMC is continuously presenting excellent research papers based on active research on advanced medicine. SMC is involved in the 3 major national research projects under the Ministry of Health and Welfare. These assignments are the designation as a Regional Clinical Trial Center, Clinical Trial Professional Training Academy, and a Medical Device Clinical Trial Center. It was also designated as a guidance-style research-oriented hospital to develop new biomedicine that can overcome obstinate cancers. Samsung Medical Center, one of the world's top ten hospitals to conduct the most multinational clinical trials, was accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and was registered as an institutional board and a clinical study center by the US Department of Health and Human Services. It is also the first non-US medical institution to obtain an accreditation from the Association for the Accreditation Of Human Research Protection Program (AAHRPP).  International health services  Opened in September 1995, International Health Services offers inpatient and outpatient treatments, consultations, and referrals across a comprehensive range of specializations. The service is a major component of the Samsung Medical Center's Seoul hospital, one of the country's leading health care institutions. Samsung Medical Center is well received among foreign residents for its outstanding medical and nursing staff and for its proficient services. International Health Services has put into effect the cashless service with certain companies, main embassies, foreign schools, and US army hospitals for the convenience of foreign patients visiting IHS. In addition, IHS has become the undisputed no. 1 International clinic within Korea, with a large portion of foreign patients residing in Korea as well as those residing in other parts of Asia and Middle East visiting the clinic each year.

It has also been engaged in support activities worth more than KRW 37 billion by providing volunteer medical services for social welfare facilities, remote communities with low accessibility of care and through charitable work for disaster areas home and abroad. SMC launched ‚ÄúMedical Volunteer's Group‚Äù for systemic volunteer medical services in 2006, has developed the ‚ÄúFree Medical Services: Sharing Happiness‚Äù to provide volunteer medical service for residents in farming and fishing communities. It is also providing opportunities for medical treatment, rehabilitation and social participation for the impoverished patients by giving support for their medical expenses, in an effort to become a warm and caring hospital for the people. Samsung Medical Center is also engaged in charitable activities that are in connection with affiliates of Samsung Group. Its major activities include the ‚ÄúBringing back bright smiles‚Äù project, which provides free plastic surgery and rehabilitation programs for low-income patients with facial deformities, the ‚ÄúFinding the Harmony of the world‚Äù project which supports artificial cochlea implant operations and rehabilitations for hearing-impaired people, the ‚ÄúHeart for Eye‚Äù which provides eyesight recovery operations for low-income visually impaired children, and the ‚ÄúHeart to Heart‚Äù project supporting free operations for Vietnamese children with congenital heart disease. These activities all enable underprivileged low-income disabled people to live with a better view on life. In addition, SMC operates the ‚ÄúApple Tree of Hope‚Äù donation campaign on a constant basis. The campaign supports hospital expenses for the impoverished patients, and operates hospital schools for long-stay child patients to enable them to continue their studies that may have been suspended due to their illnesses. It also provides medical service to disaster areas abroad by visiting them, including the Kobe earthquake (1995), the Taiwan earthquake (2006) and the tsunami in Southeast Asia (2004).  Global Cooperation  A leap into a global top-class hospital through a strong network with overseas medical institutes and through MOUs with overseas organizations for medical cooperation. Samsung Medical Center, which aims to become a globally leading hospital, has been promoting active interaction with various distinguished medical institutes worldwide including Mayo Clinic (US), MD Anderson Cancer Center (US), and Beijing University Hospital. Since 2009, the hospital is also promoting full-scale activities to attract foreign patients, which comprise a dynamic force for Korea's new growth. The Hospital is particularly focusing on direct consultation with foreign governments, signing memoranda of understanding with the Mongolian Embassy in Korea (July 2009), Vladivostok City (Aug. 2009), Dubai (June. 2010) and Almaty, Kazakhstan (Aug. 2010). One of the most outstanding achievements is the opening of the Samsung Dubai Medical Center in Dubai, UAE, which made the hospital the first Korean hospital to advance into the Middle East. Based on all these efforts, the hospital received a citation from the Ministry of Health and Welfare as the hospital attracting the most foreign patients.

The first volume was released by Del Rey Manga on April 10, 2007, with the second and final volume released on July 3, 2007. The comic was also released in Brazil with the name \\"Fa√ßa Cinco Pedidos\\". Plot =Volume 1= The story is about a teenage girl named Hana. She is lonely and unpopular at school, so she spends most of her time on the internet creating \\"various cool, smart, sexy, and popular alter egos.\\" Her \\"best friend\\" is an imaginary version of Avril Lavigne, who acts as Hana's conscience as well as an imaginary friend. Becoming increasingly isolated in life, Hana one day stumbles across a website, www.make5wishes.com, which offers to grant five wishes for a small fee of $19.95. Eager and desperate to turn her life around, she places an order on the site. A few days later, a small box arrives. As Hana opens it in her bedroom, a small demon-like creature comes out. The demon befriends her and explains how the wishes work. As Hana makes her first few wishes, things do not turn out the way she would have liked, and the wishes the demon grants often have unforeseen and unwanted consequences; for example causing dementia in an old man who Hana wished she would not have to talk to again. In addition, the demon secretly e-mails the people (including Jessica) whom she talks to online as one of her aliases, while she sleeps, messing with them and their feelings. =Volume 2= The story follows on from volume 1, and details how Hana's wishes are continuing to affect those around her in unwanted ways. Hana, after initially liking the demon and naming him Romeo, becomes increasingly angry and distrustful of him. After surviving an explosion at her school which kills a teacher (Mr. Terry) and several students (i.e. Jessica and Brian) another of Hana's wishes is granted: for everyone to love her. Indeed, they do, and hold a celebration in her honor for surviving the explosion. However, Hana is now enveloped in a shroud of fire which no one else can see, and which increasingly clouds her from reality. Her imaginary version of Avril Lavigne seldom shows herself any more, and Hana locks the demon in its box, not wanting it to cause any more trouble. However, she has one final wish, and without thinking she grabs Romeo and makes her final wish, to meet the real Avril Lavigne, before sealing him back in his box. At school the other students are much nicer to Hana, and one invites her to a cosplay gathering, held on a small bridge in the town. Hana decides to go as Avril Lavigne. After getting dressed, she looks in the mirror, and sees Avril Lavigne looking back at her. She realizes that her final wish has been granted, and Romeo has tricked her once again. Distraught, she runs home and grabs Romeo's box with him in it, and goes to the party. There, she looks out over the bridge at the river below. Another party-goer comes up to her and comments on how nice she looks, immediately recognizing she has dressed as Avril Lavigne. They talk, but the shroud of fire around Hana becomes more intense. With Romeo trapped in the box, Hana jumps off the bridge. The shroud of fire disappears and Hana is at peace, knowing that the demon will never be able to hurt anyone again, until she notices that the box is empty and Romeo has escaped. Back on the bridge, the crowd is in shock. The girl Hana was talking to removes her fancy dress wig to reveal her long blonde hair - it was the real Avril Lavigne who Hana had been speaking to. Hana's fate is unknown. Themes The comic addresses the stress of modern angsty teenage life and the pressures of family turmoil, shows through escapism and desperation of the main character, Hana. Avril Lavigne An imaginary alter ego of Avril Lavigne appears in the story as one of the main characters. Hana dreams of meeting Avril and being close friends. Avril responds to this: \\"I know that many of my fans read comics, and I'm really excited to be involved in creating stories that I know they will enjoy.\\" Notes *Make 5 Wishes is currently a podcast on iTunes.

He held a succession of public offices. Scampston Hall, North Yorkshire, in 2006 St Quintin was the eldest son of William St Quintin of Muston and his wife Elizabeth Strickland, daughter of Sir William Strickland of Boynton. His father died in 1695 and he succeeded to the baronetcy in November 1695 on the death of his grandfather, Sir Henry St. Quintin of Harpham, who outlived his father by only a few days. In the 1690s, St. Quintin bought an estate at Scampston near Malton and Scampston Hall subsequently became the main family seat. St Quintin belonged to one of the leading merchant families in Hull, and was an active member of the corporation. He was Chamberlain of Hull in 1689. He entered Parliament at the 1695 English general election as Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull, and served as the city's MP in eleven parliaments. A capable official, he held a series of responsible and lucrative posts. From 1698 to 1701 was a Commissioner of Customs, with the substantial salary of ¬£1000 a year, but resigned the office when a new law barring the commissioners from sitting in Parliament came into force. He was Mayor of Hull in 1700. From 1706 to 1713 he was a Commissioner of Revenue in Ireland, at the same salary. He was Commissioner for taking subscriptions to South Sea Company in 1711. From 1714 to 1717 he was a Lord of the Treasury. St Quintin was Mayor of Hull again in 1715. In 1717, he became Commissioner of the Alienation Office, and in 1720 he was appointed joint Vice-Treasurer, Receiver General and Paymaster of Ireland, offices he held until his death. He was also a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. St Quintin died unmarried on 30 June 1723, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his nephew William. His body was interred at St. John of Beverley Church Harpham.

It grows in late July to November in the east and in the winter on the west coast of North America. It has a rusty orange spore print and a bitter taste. Systematics Gymnopilus luteofolius was first described as Agaricus luteofolius by Charles Horton Peck in 1875. It was renamed Pholiota luteofolius by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1887, and was given its current name by mycologist Rolf Singer in 1951. Description The fruit bodies of Gymnopilus luteofolius have reddish to purplish to yellow caps in diameter, which often develop green stains. This cap surface is covered with fasciculate scales that start out purplish, soon fade to brick red, and finally fades to yellow as the mushroom matures. The context is reddish to light lavender, fading to yellowish as the mushroom matures. The gills have adnate attachment and start off yellow, turning rusty brown as the spores mature. The stipe is the same color as the cap, often dusted with rusty brown spores, fibrillose, measuring 3‚Äì9 by 3‚Äì10 mm thick, equal to enlarged near the base. The stipe often has greenish stains near the base. The taste is bitter. Gymnopilus luteofolius spores The spores are bright rusty brown in deposit, measuring (5.5) 6‚Äì8.5 x (3.5) 4‚Äì4.5 Œºm, ellipsoid to subellipsoid, inequilateral, roughened and dextrinoid, with no germ pore. The basidia measure 24‚Äì28 x 6‚Äì7 Œºm and are 4-spored. The basidioles are often brown. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) measures 30‚Äì38 x 5‚Äì10 Œºm, hyaline, fusoid to subventricose. The cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) measures 23‚Äì28 x 4‚Äì7 Œºm, ventricose to flash shaped, often capitate. The lamellar trama is made up of parallel hyphae 5‚Äì18 Œºm across, frequently septate, with yellowish pigment that is dissolved by potassium hydroxide. The pileus trama is interwoven, and the pileus cuticle has brown tufts of brown incrusted hyphae. The pileocystidia measure 44‚Äì53 (100) Œºm, and are club-shaped, cylindrical or ventricose terminal elements on the hyphae that forms the scales on the cap. Cystidia on the stipe (caulocystidia) are 20‚Äì63 x 3‚Äì15 Œºm, club shaped, ventricose or flask shaped. The gill trama and pileus trama are pale yellowish-brown in KOH and reddish brown in Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are present.

The son of an engine driver, he entered Duntroon in 1913. His class graduated early after the First World War broke out, and he served on the Western Front with the field artillery. After the war, he spent nearly twenty years as a major. Berryman joined the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 4 April 1940 with the rank of full colonel, and became General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of the 6th Division. He was responsible for the staff work for the attacks on Bardia and Tobruk. In January 1941, Berryman became Commander, Royal Artillery, 7th Division, and was promoted to brigadier. During the Syria-Lebanon campaign, he commanded \\"Berryforce\\". He returned to Australia in 1942, becoming Major General, General Staff, of the First Army. Later that year, he became Deputy Chief of the General Staff under the Commander in Chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey, who brought him up to Port Moresby to simultaneously act as chief of staff of New Guinea Force. Berryman was intimately involved with the planning and execution of the Salamaua-Lae campaign and the Huon Peninsula campaign. In November 1943 he became acting commander of II Corps, which he led in the Battle of Sio. In the final part of the war, he was Blamey's representative at General of the Army Douglas MacArthur's headquarters and the Australian Army representative at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay. After the war, Berryman commanded Eastern Command. He directed the military response to the 1949 Australian coal strike. Berryman hoped to become Chief of the General Staff but was passed over as he was seen as a \\"Blamey man\\" by Prime Minister Ben Chifley. He retired and became the Director General of the Royal Tour of Queen Elizabeth II in 1954. He was Chief Executive Officer of the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales from 1954 to 1961. Education and early life Frank Horton Berryman was born in Geelong, Victoria, on 11 April 1894, the fourth of six children and the eldest of three sons of William Lee Berryman, a Victorian Railways engine driver, and his wife, Annie Jane, n√©e Horton. William Berryman joined in the 1903 Victorian Railways strike and, when it failed, was reinstated with a 14 per cent pay cut, only regaining his 1903 pay level in 1916. Frank was educated at Melbourne High School, where he served in the school Cadet Unit, and won the Rix prize for academic excellence. On graduation, he took a job with the Victorian railways as a junior draughtsman. In 1913, Berryman entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, having ranked first among the 154 candidates on the entrance examination. Of the 33 members in his class, nine died in the First World War, and six later became generals: Leslie Beavis, Berryman, William Bridgeford, John Chapman, Edward Milford and Alan Vasey. Berryman rose to fifth in order of merit before his class graduated early, in June 1915, because of the outbreak of the First World War. First World War Berryman's Duntroon class had not yet completed its military training. Major General William Throsby Bridges decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he assigned the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), rather than as staff officers. Cadets were given the choice of service in the infantry or light horse. One cadet, Lawrence Wackett, protested that he wished to serve in the technical services. When asked if they would prefer the technical services, twelve cadets, including Berryman, Beavis, Clowes, Vasey, and Wackett stepped forward. Berryman was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Permanent Military Forces (PMF) on 29 June 1915 and again in the First AIF on 1 July 1915. He was posted to Lieutenant Colonel Harold Grimwade's 4th Field Artillery Brigade of the 2nd Division Artillery, along with Vasey and Milford. Berryman embarked for Egypt with the 4th Field Artillery Brigade on the transport Wiltshire on 17 November 1915. In Egypt, Berryman briefly commanded the 4th Brigade Ammunition Column before it was absorbed into the 2nd Division Ammunition Column. The 2nd Division moved to France in March 1916. Berryman became a temporary captain on 1 April 1916, a rank which became substantive on 10 June 1916. In January 1917, he was posted to the 7th Infantry Brigade as a trainee staff captain. During the Second Battle of Bullecourt he served with 2nd Division headquarters. He was appointed to command the 18th Field Artillery Battery, and became a temporary major on 1 September 1917, which became substantive on 10 September 1917. This was as far as he could go, for Duntroon graduates could not be promoted above major in the AIF. This policy was aimed at giving them a broad range of experience, which would benefit the Army, while not allowing them to outnumber the available post-war positions. While commanding the 18th Field Battery, he saw action at the Battle of Passchendaele. For his service as a battery commander in this battle, he received a Mention in Despatches: alt=Head and shoulders of a young man in uniform, wearing a peaked cap. In September 1918, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His citation, signed by Major General Charles Rosenthal, read: Berryman was later nominated for a bar to his Distinguished Service Order for the September 1918 fighting, but this was subsequently downgraded to a second Mention in Despatches. He was wounded in the right eye in September 1918 while he was commanding the 14th Field Artillery Battery. Although his wound was serious enough to warrant hospitalisation, there was no permanent damage to his vision. However, it was the end of his career as a battery commander, as the Army took the opportunity to transfer him to a staff post. From 28 October 1918 to 1 July 1919, he was Brigade Major of the 7th Infantry Brigade. With the war over, he returned to Australia in October 1919. Between the wars Berryman was appointed to the Staff Corps on 1 October 1920. Although he was entitled to keep his AIF rank of major as an honorary rank, his substantive rank‚Äîand pay grade‚Äîwas still lieutenant. Promotion was painfully slow. He was promoted to captain and brevet major on 1 March 1923, but was not promoted to the substantive rank of major until 1 March 1935. Berryman attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from 1920 to 1923. On returning to Australia, he became an inspecting ordnance officer at the 2nd Military District. From its headquarters at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, the 2nd Military District administered the Army in most of New South Wales. He enrolled in a Bachelor of Science program at the University of Sydney. On 30 November 1925, he married Muriel Whipp. They eventually had a daughter and a son. Berryman discontinued his university studies to prepare for the entrance examination for Staff College, Camberley. Eighteen Australian Army officers sat the exam that year, but only Berryman and one other officer passed. Only two Australian officers were accepted into staff college each year, so Berryman's attendance from 1926 to 1928 marked him out as one of the Australian Army's rising talents. It also allowed him to forge useful contacts with the British Army. Berryman later recalled, \\"The advantage of this was that in war we had the same doctrine of tactics and administration, which was essential if we had to work together. More than that, the officers who had to carry out their duties in cooperation knew each other personally.\\" After graduation he was posted to the High Commission of Australia, London, from 1929 to 1932, where he served under the Military Liaison Officer, Major General Julius Bruche. After nearly twenty years as a major, Berryman was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1935. Promotion to substantive rank, which carried the rank's pay as well as status, occurred on 1 July 1938, when he became Assistant Director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters. From December 1938 to April 1940 he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of the 3rd Division. The slow rate of promotion of regular officers in the inter-war years fostered a sense of injustice and frustration among officers with good war records who found themselves outranked by Militia officers who had enjoyed faster promotion. Second World War =Libya= Arthur Allen, 16th Infantry Brigade; Major General Iven Mackay; Brigadier Horace Robertson, 19th Infantry Brigade. Back row, left to right: Colonel Frank Berryman, GSO1; Brigadier Stanley Savige, 17th Infantry Brigade; Colonel Alan Vasey, AA&QMG.; The final straw for many regular officers was Prime Minister Robert Menzies' announcement that all commands in the Second AIF would go to Militia officers, which Berryman considered \\"a damn insult to the professional soldier, calculated to split the Army down the centre. We were to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water. We, the only people who really knew the job, were to assist these Militia fellows.\\" Berryman joined the Second AIF on 4 April 1940 with the rank of full colonel, receiving the AIF serial number of VX20308, and became General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of Major General Iven Mackay's 6th Division, in succession to Sydney Rowell who stepped up to become chief of staff of I Corps. Berryman soon established a good working relationship with Mackay. Despite the friction between Militia and Staff Corps officers, Berryman chose to assess officers on performance. This meant that while Berryman viewed some Militia officers, like Brigadier Stanley Savige of the 17th Infantry Brigade, with disdain, he maintained good relations with others. There were also personal and professional rivalries with other Staff Corps officers, such as Alan Vasey. Yet even those who disliked Berryman personally for his lack of patience and tact and referred to him as \\"Berry the Bastard\\" respected his abilities as a staff officer. Mackay and Berryman were determined that the Battle of Bardia would not be a repeat of the disastrous landing at Anzac Cove in 1915. Berryman's talent for operational staff work came to the fore. From studies of aerial photographs, he selected a spot for the attack where the terrain was most favourable. His plan provided for the coordination of infantry, armour and artillery. While at times he proved secretive and hard to deal with, during the battle his forceful personality provided a good foil to the sometimes indecisive Mackay. Later that month Berryman planned the equally successful Battle of Tobruk. For his services in this campaign, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). =Syria= In January 1941, Berryman became Commander, Royal Artillery, in Arthur \\"Tubby\\" Allen's 7th Division, and was promoted to brigadier. During the Syria-Lebanon campaign, Berryman demonstrated that he was a thrusting commander who led from the front and repeatedly demonstrated his coolness under fire. When his headquarters came under shell fire for the first time, Berryman sat calmly eating his breakfast \\"among the flying brick dust and bursting shells\\", simply telling the men to shut the door, \\"so they can eat breakfast without being covered in dust\\". Syria, June 1941. Left to right: Major General A. S. Allen, Brigadier F. H. Berryman and Brigadier A. R. Baxter-Cox. During the Vichy French counterattack, Berryman was given command of the Australian forces in the centre of the position around Merdjayoun. This scratch force became known as \\"Berryforce\\". His mission was to check the enemy advance in the Merdjayoun area. Berryman decided that the best way to do this would be to recapture Merdjayoun. This presented considerable difficulty, for although his force contained two infantry battalions, the 2/25th and 2/33rd, and a pioneer battalion, the 2/2nd, his headquarters was not equipped to control a battle in the manner of an infantry brigade, as it lacked appropriate staff and communications. Moreover, while he was supported by mechanised cavalry and 22 artillery pieces, the opposing French forces had tanks. For the next two weeks, the outnumbered Berryforce attempted to retake the strategically important town in the Battle of Merdjayoun. His first attempt was a failure. After carrying out a personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman tried again. This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by the French Foreign Legion and tanks. Berryman then tried a different approach. Instead of attempting to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with being cut off, the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery. The 7th Division was now concentrated in the coastal sector. Berryman clashed with Brigadier Jack Stevens of the 21st Infantry Brigade over the siting of Berryman's artillery observation posts, which were forward of the infantry's front lines. Berryman wanted Stevens' positions advanced so as to obtain effective observation of the enemy's lines for Berryman's gunners. Stevens refused, hampering Berryman's efforts to support him in the Battle of Damour. Despite this, Berryman implemented an effective artillery plan. In the final stage of the battle, Berryman, without authority, ordered Lieutenant Colonel Denzil MacArthur-Onslow of the 2/6th Cavalry Regiment to pursue the retreating French forces, but was overruled by Savige and Allen. For his part in the campaign, Berryman received a third Mention in Despatches. =Papua= On 3 August 1941, Berryman became Brigadier, General Staff (chief of staff) of I Corps under Lieutenant General John Lavarack, again in succession to Rowell, who became Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS). Berryman arrived in Jakarta by air with the advanced party of the I Corps headquarters staff on 26 January 1942 to plan its defence. Berryman reconnoitred Java and prepared an appreciation of the situation. Berryman also attempted to find out as much as possible about Japanese tactics through interviewing Colonel Ian MacAlister Stewart. This information found its way into papers circulated throughout the Army in Australia. It soon became apparent that the situation was hopeless and any troops committed to the defence of Java would be lost. Berryman returned to Australia, where he was promoted to major general on 6 April 1942, when he became Major General, General Staff (chief of staff) of Lavarack's First Army. On 14 September 1942, Berryman became DCGS under the Commander in Chief, General Sir Sir Thomas Blamey, in succession to Vasey. When New Guinea Force split into a rear headquarters under Blamey and an advanced headquarters under Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, so the latter could go forward to direct the Battle of Buna-Gona, Blamey brought Berryman up from Advanced LHQ in Brisbane to simultaneously act as chief of staff of New Guinea Force from 11 December 1942. Berryman formed a very close professional and personal relationship with Blamey, and henceforth Berryman would be Blamey's chief of staff and head of operational planning, which made him \\"one of the most important officers in the Australian Army in its struggle against the Japanese.\\" =New Guinea= Blamey and Berryman remained close for the rest of the war, and Blamey came to rely heavily on Berryman for advice. It was Berryman who was sent to Wau to investigate the difficulties that Savige was having, and it was Berryman who exonerated Savige. \\"I reported the situation [to Blamey and Herring],\\" Berryman record in his diary, \\"and said Savige had done well and we had misjudged him.\\"Berryman diary, 21 August 1943, AWM93 50/2/23/331 Berryman was intimately involved with the planning of the Salamaua-Lae campaign, working closely with Brigadier General Stephen J. Chamberlin at General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) in Brisbane. Berryman established good working relations with the Americans, even though their staff practices were quite different from those of the Australian Army. Berryman was also involved in the plan's execution, once more becoming chief of staff at New Guinea Force under Blamey in August 1943. Berryman was frustrated at the failure of Vasey's 7th Division to destroy the Japanese retreating from Lae, and personally annoyed by the way that Vasey forwarded compliments to Major General Ennis Whitehead while leaving any complaints about air support to be taken up by Berryman.Berryman diary, 8 September 1943, AWM93 50/2/23/331 Berryman was next involved with the planning for the landing at Finschhafen, brokering a compromise landing plan between Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. When Berryman discovered that the United States Seventh Fleet did not intend to reinforce the 9th Division he immediately went to Blamey, who took the matter up with MacArthur. However, it was Berryman who brokered a compromise deal with Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender to reinforce Finschhafen with a battalion in APDs. On 7 November 1943, Berryman became acting commander of II Corps, a post which became permanent on 20 January 1944, superseding Vasey, whose 7th Division was diplomatically placed directly under Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead's New Guinea Force. II Corps was left with the 5th and 9th Divisions. Berryman was promoted to lieutenant general on 20 January 1944. As in Syria, Berryman proved a hard-driving commander. In December 1943, II Corps broke out of the position around Finschhafen and began a pursuit along the coast. Whenever the Japanese Army attempted to make a stand, Berryman attacked with 25-pounder artillery barrages and Matilda tanks. Berryman was aware that seasonal changes were making the surf rougher and making it ever harder to operate the US Army landing craft (LCMs) and Australian Army amphibious trucks (DUKWs) that he depended on for the logistical support of his troops, but he realised that the Japanese Army's supply difficulties were greater than his own, and he gambled that if he pushed hard enough the Japanese would be unable to regroup and organise a successful defence. General Sir Thomas Blamey (front row, centre) and the other Australian delegates to the Japanese surrender aboard USS Missouri, September 1945 In the first phase of the Battle of Sio, the advance from Finschhafen to Sio, 3,099 Japanese dead were counted and 38 prisoners taken, at a cost of 8 Australians killed and 48 wounded. In the 5th Division's subsequent drive from Sio to link up with the US 32nd Infantry Division at Saidor, 734 Japanese were killed and 1,775 found dead, while 48 prisoners were taken. Australian casualties came to 4 killed and 6 wounded. MacArthur considered Berryman's performance \\"quite brilliant\\". For his part in the campaign, Berryman was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 8 March 1945. =Borneo= II Corps was renumbered I Corps on 13 April 1944 and returned to Australia, where Blamey gave Berryman his next assignment. In preparation for the Philippines Campaign, General MacArthur moved the advanced element of GHQ to Hollandia in Dutch West Papua, where it opened in late August 1944. To maintain contact with GHQ, Blamey formed a new headquarters, Forward Echelon LHQ, which opened at Hollandia on 7 September under Berryman, who became Blamey's personal representative at GHQ. Forward Echelon LHQ subsequently moved with GHQ to Leyte in February 1945, and Manila in April 1945.Report on Operations by Australian Military Forces in Borneo 1 May 1945 to 15 August 1945, AWM54 617/7/43 Berryman's role was to \\"safeguard Australian interests\\" at GHQ, but he also defended GHQ against criticism from the Australian Army. As well as liaising with GHQ, Forward Echelon LHQ became responsible for planning operations involving Australian troops. It worked on plans for operations on Luzon and Mindanao before it was finally decided that Borneo would be the Australian Army's next objective. In all of this Berrymen kept in close contact with Blamey, and the two were Australian Army representatives at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay in September 1945. For his services in the final campaigns, Berryman received a fourth and final Mention in Despatches on 6 March 1947. Later life After the war, Berryman took charge of Eastern Command, an appointment he held from March 1946 until his retirement at age 60 in April 1954. Berryman became known for his involvement in charitable organisations such as the War Widows Association, and as head of the Remembrance Drive Project. For this and his commitment to beautifying the Army barracks, Berryman became colloquially known in the Army as \\"Frank the Florist\\". In June 1949, the country was rocked by the 1949 Australian coal strike. The strike began when stocks of coal were already low, especially in New South Wales, and rationing was introduced. Prime Minister Ben Chifley turned to the Army to get the troops to mine coal. This became possible when the transport unions agreed to transport coal that was mined. Responsibility for planning and organising the effort fell to Berryman. Soldiers began mining at Muswellbrook and Lithgow on 1 August, and by 15 August, when the strike ended, some 4,000 soldiers and airmen were employed. They continued work until production was fully restored. Berryman hoped to become Chief of the General Staff in succession to Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee but he was seen as a \\"Blamey man\\" by Chifley and his Labor government colleagues, who disliked the former Commander-in-Chief. The job was instead given to Rowell. The United States government awarded Berryman the Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm in 1948. Following the change of government in 1949, Berryman lobbied Sir Eric Harrison, the Liberal Minister for Defence Production, for the job on the retirement of Rowell in 1954, but he was now considered too old for the job. Berryman became the Director General of the Royal Tour of Queen Elizabeth II in 1954, for which he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO). He was Chief Executive Officer of the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales from 1954 to 1961. He died on 28 May 1981 at Rose Bay, New South Wales, and was cremated with full military honours. At the time of his funeral the Ambassador for Lebanon, Raymond Heneine, wrote in the Canberra Times: \\"The inhabitants of Jezzine will never forget General Berryman, who liberated their town from the forces of the Vichy French in collaboration with the Italian and German forces. He was for them not only a great general but also a great benefactor who provided them with food supplies and medical care. In fact he was the example of humanitarianism\\".

During the Bosnian War of 1992-1995 he served as the president of the Jewish community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played a central role in the rescue and evacuation of thousands of Sarajevo residents. Biography Ceresnjes was born in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina). He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the Arhitektonsko - Urbanisticki Fakultet (Faculty of Urban Architecture) in the University of Sarajevo and afterwards worked as a practicing architect-designer, project manager, and manager of the building department, with responsibility for approximately 500,000 square meters of buildings in the Sarajevo area. His work included designing, building, restoration and conservation of sacred buildings of various religious denominations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as churches and mosques. A significant part of his professional activity was devoted to Jewish buildings and sites. He was engaged in initiating, supporting, organizing the funding, and actively working on revitalization, reconstruction, and conservation of the 16th-century old Sephardic cemetery in Sarajevo. That project was prepared for a public presentation twenty-four hours before war broke out in Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1992. Ceresnjes also surveyed and planned restorations for the Ashkenazi synagogue in Sarajevo (built in 1902), the 17th-century Il Kal Nuevu Sephardic synagogue, and the cemetery chapel on the Jewish cemetery (1926). The grave of Rabbi Moshe Danon chief Rabbi of Sarajevo (1815-1830), Located in Stolac, Bosnia and Herzegovina In 1989-1990 he planned and headed the reconstruction of the Jewish summer camp in Pirovac, Croatia, which served as a central meeting place for the entire Jewish community of the former Yugoslavia. In 1990-1991 he prepared and headed the restoration and conservation of the complex of the burial site of Rabbi Moshe Danon, a significant historic person from the Bosnian Jewish community (1832, The Sarajevo Megilla) in Stolac, Herzegovina. Jewish community leader Ceresnjes served as head of the Jewish community of Bosnia and Herzegovina and vice-chairman of the Yugoslav Federation of Jewish Communities from 1992 until his emigration to Israel in 1996. His tenure coincided with the Bosnian War of 1992-1995. When the besieging Serb army occupied the Jewish cemetery in Sarajevo, Ceresnjes gave permission to the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to bomb the cemetery (in the end,this proved not necessary). Ceresnjes and the Sarajevo Jewish humanitarian society, La Benevolencija, also provided aid to thousands of besieged Sarajevo residents, supplying food, medicine, and postal and radio communications. Ceresnjes told a local paper that the nonsectarian relief effort was partly a gesture of gratitude to local Muslims who had hidden Jews during the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia. As a student of Balkan history, Ceresnjes said he had anticipated the war a full year before it broke out, and had organized the Jewish community of Sarajevo to stockpile supplies, make sure everyone had passports, make plans to evacuate the children and the elderly, and find places for the evacuees in Israel and Europe. After the war started, Ceresnjes and La Benevolencija assisted the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in the evacuation of 2,500 Sarajevo residents, only one-third of whom were Jewish. There were 11 evacuations in all, three by air early on in the war, and eight by bus convoy after the airport had been closed to civilian traffic. While other convoys were stopped, the Ceresnjes convoys all got through, as field staff from the Joint negotiated to cease fires to ensure a safe transfer. In recognition of his wartime humanitarian efforts, Ceresnjes was awarded the French L√©gion d'honneur in October 1994. He published his wartime memoirs in a 35-page monograph, Caught in the winds of war: Jews in the former Yugoslavia, in 1999. Work in Israel Ceresnjes made aliyah to Israel in 1996. In 1997 he joined the Center for Jewish Art at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as an architect-researcher. He is permanently engaged in the documentation of the Jewish architectural cultural heritage in the former Yugoslavia and other Eastern European countries, along with the mapping of Holocaust memorials and monuments. He also assists the United States Congressional Commission for Protecting and Preserving American Property Abroad, which was founded in 1985 to survey Jewish cemeteries, memorials and monuments, with a primary focus on Eastern Europe.

Engraved by Robert Nanteuil after the drawing of Fran√ßois Chauveau. Marc Vulson de la Colombi√®re (‚Ä†1658)Vulson de La Colombi√®re was dead by 1660, when the 2nd edition of his Palais des curieux appeared. (See ‚ÄòAdvis au lecteur‚Äô.) or Sieur de la Colombi√®re was a French heraldist, historian, poet, minion of the royal court. His name is sometimes spelt as Wulson and also as Volson. He published several highly successful books on symbols, prophecies, heraldry, dreams etc. He put together all the available knowledge and traditions associated with chivalry. In the 17th century chivalry was practically rediscovered by two genealogists in the French court: Vulson de la Colombi√®re and Claude-Fran√ßois M√©nestrier after its golden age (1100‚Äì1400) and the decline of chivalry, developing its idealized image. Some authors named Vulson de la de la Colombi√®re as the inventor of hatching system of tinctures.  Biography  Page 38 of Vulson de la Colombi√®re's 1644 book with his hatching table We have only some fragmented data about his life. Even the 19th century big biographies deliver only incomplete information about him. He was born in a Protestant noble family at the end of the 16th century in Dauphin√©. He was a son of Fran√ßois, advocat and Michelle Odde de Bonniot.\\"G. de Rivoire de La Batie, Armorial et Histoire de Dauphin√©, Fam. de Vulson, p. 815\\" In his youth, he fought for Henry IV. According to a curious anecdote, in 1618 he went to Paris to request grace, after he killed his treacherous wife and her lover.\\"Ayant un jour surpris sa femme en adultere, il la tua elle et son gallant; il vint en poste √† Paris solliciter sa grace, qu'il obtint. Cet ev√©nement arriva √† Grenoble en 1618. Depuis l'on mena√ßoit dans cette ville les femmes coquettes da la vulsonade.\\" (Thomas Moule, Bibliotheca heraldica Magn√¶ Britanni√¶. London, 1822. p. 616) (Comp. Chaudon, L. M. [Louis Mayeul], Dictionnaire universel, historique, critique, et bibliographique, XVIII, Paris, 1812, p. 149). According to the title pages of his books, (see for example Le Vray Th√©√¢tre d¬¥honneur et de Chevalerie, Paris, 1648), he was a member of the parliament in Paris and the member of the Order of Saint Michael (gentilhomme de la Chambre du Roi et D√©cor√© de l‚ÄôOrdre de Saint-Michel). By all probability, until 1635 he was staying in Grenoble as he was a royal counselor in the Dauphin√© parliament (conseiller du roi en la cour de parlement de Dauphin√©). He also published a book in the spirit of the Gallicanism in Geneva that year. (It can be noted that several of the Protestant priests and students at the Geneva University were his kinsmen.) Gallicanism served as a proper means to express his Protestant views in opposition to Catholicism, and he presented them in such a way that it was even appreciated by the state establishment too. Vulson de la Colombi√®re‚Äôs ideas suited the king‚Äôs taste too, as a result he left Grenoble and settled down in Paris, where he devoted his entire energy to study heraldry. According to the catalogues of the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, his next book was published in Paris in 1638.  The Dispute of Vulson de la Colombi√®re and Petra Sancta  Le vray theatre d'honneur et de chevalerie...(1648) Frontispiece of Vulson de la Colombi√®re's 1639 book He had wide-ranging correspondence with the most renowned heraldists of his time. For this reason, it could perhaps be concluded that Vulson de la Colombi√®re was right in claiming the title of the inventor of the hatching system, and accusing Silvester Petra Sancta of copying his method and incorrectly publishing it in his 1638 work, one year before the same hatching system was published by Vulson de la Colombi√®re. On page 37 of his title La Science Hero√Øque (1644), Vulson de la Colombi√®re maintains that Petra Sancta simply copied his system without any changes.He writes about this in page 38 of his book Le vray th√©√¢tre d'honneur: \\"Et afin que le Lecteur se satisfasse entierement, ie luy presente les deux metaux, les cinq couleurs, & les deux pennes grau√©s en la page suiuante, & luy fais voir l‚Äôinuention de laquelle ie me suis seruy au premier liure de blazon, que ie fis imprimer pour connoistre les metaux & les couleurs par la taille douce, laquelle a √©st√© imit√©e & practiqu√©e par le docte Petra Sancta, au liure intitul√©, Tessera gentilitia, qu‚Äôil a compos√© en Latin, & fait imprimer √† Rome; Aupaurauant l‚Äôon se seruoit des lettres capitales des metaux, & des couleurs pour les denoter, mais cela enlaidissoit l‚Äôarmoirie, & apportoit de la confusion, & tout au contraire ceste inuention remplit & ombrage les pieces bien mieux qu‚Äôelles n‚Äôestoient auant qu‚Äôon la practiqu√¢t; & contente la veu√´ auec plus d‚Äôagr√©ement: Et il seroit necessaire que d‚Äôores-en- auant tous les graueurs d‚Äôvn comm√∫n consentement se seruissent de ceste methodo, & la practiquassent inuiolablement lors qu‚Äôils grauent des Armoiries en des lieux o√π l‚Äôon ne peut dechiffrer leurs blazons, ny exprimer leur √©mail. L‚Äôor est pointill√©; l‚Äôargent est sans aucune haschure: car denotant le blanc, l‚Äôon ne s√ßauroit le mieux faire connoistre, qu‚Äôen n‚Äôy faisant rien du tout; l‚ÄôAzur est hasch√© en fasce; le gueules en Pal, le Synolpe en bande, le Sable est h√¢ch√© doublement, & le Pourpre en barre, les deux pennes ou fourrures sont assez connoissables par tout; Si bien que sans peine, sans enluminure, sans charger sa memoire, & sans beaucoup embarrasser son esprit, l‚Äôon pourroit connoistre l‚Äô√©mail de toutes les Armoiries, pourueu qu‚Äôon se rende ceste table familiere. I‚Äôay practiqu√© cela dans la plus grande partie de celles qui sont grau√©es dans ce liure, y en ayant pourtant beaucoup, & particulierment √† celles o√π il y a des animaux, o√π ie me suis content√© de faire simplement le trait, afin que ceux qui desireront de les enluminer, lepuissent faire auec moins de peine & d‚Äôincommodit√©\\". Philipp Jakob Spener also cites the page 38 of Vulson de la Colombi√®re‚Äôs 1644 work, but not exactly the same way: \\"Je lui fais voir l'invention, de laquelle je me suis seruy au premier livre de blason, que je fis imprimer, pour conno√Ætre les metaux & les couleurs par la taille douce laquelle a √©t√© imit√©e & pratiqu√©e par le docte Petra Sancta: auparavant l'on se servoit des lettres capitales. Ostendi ei inventionem, qu√¢ (an √† se invenia, an aliunde mutuo sumpta,) usus eram in primo de insignibus quem edideram libro, ut metalla & colores sculptorum lineolis exprimerentur: secutus est Doct. Petra Sancta: cum prius literis initialibus uti in more esset\\". (Spener, Insignium Theoria Seu Operis Heraldici Pars Generalis. Frankfurt [Main], 1717. p. 113. [First edition, Ibid. 1690]) Vulson de la Colombi√®re also maintains that he showed to Petra Sancta his hatching system in the past. In his citation, Vulson de la Colombi√®re also mentions the book publishers and copperplate engravers as the users of the hatching system, thus emphasizing that by using this method on the illustrations, engravers can always designate the tinctures of the copperplates in the same coherent manner. In the title of his 1639 book he directly mentions that hatching is a new method used by copperplate engravings (\\"suivant l'art des anciens roys d'armes... et une nouvelle m√©thode de cognoistre les m√©taux et couleurs sur la taille-douce\\"). The book was published by Melchior Tavernier, and the engraved fontoispiece was made by Abraham Bosse. Maybe he was also the author of the remaining engravings inside the book. However, Vulson de la Colombi√®re contributed to the drawing and engraving of illustrations too, as we can see from his signature under the armorial genealogical table of his supporter, Denys de Salvaing. In his 1639 title, Vulson de la Colombi√®re published a hatching table, but did not mention Petra Sancta. The reason probably was that in 1638 the publication of his book was already in progress and/or he did not know nothing about the same hatching method published by Petra Sancta in 1638. He had also described the way of hatchings by words, and published another hatching table in 1644. Ottfried Neubecker maintains that the hatching system in heraldry was invented by Vulson de la Colombi√®re and not Petra Sancta who only popularized the system through his second treatise titled Tesserae gentilitia, published in 1638.

In the 1970s √ñzbekhan was co founder and first director of The Club of Rome, with Aurelio Peccei an Italian Industrialist, and Alexander Christakis, a physicist and systems research designer. √ñzbekhan wrote the original prospectus for The Club of Rome, The Predicament of Mankind. This document served as vision for systems scientists who, under the leadership of Alexander Christakis and the 21st Century Agoras developed the science of structured dialogic design. √ñzbekhan is credited for the formulation of the Axiom of Engagement, which states that 'it is unethical to try to change any socio-technical system without the explicit permission and participation of those involved'. The related Requisite Law of Action states that 'any attempts to do so are bound to fail' (Law of Requisite Action; Yiannis Laouris).

Adults have brownish upperparts with gray on the crown and nape, and a grayish-buff- colored breast with dark streaks; they have a dark face with gray cheeks, a white throat, and a short, pointed tail. Birds show a small yellow streak just above the eye. Their breeding habitat is salt marshes on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States from southern New Hampshire to southern Texas. The nest is an open cup usually built in the salt marsh on tidal reeds and spartina grasses. Females lay two to five eggs. Northern birds most often migrate farther south along the eastern coast of the United States. They forage on the ground or in marsh vegetation, sometimes probing in mud. They mainly eat insects, marine invertebrates and seeds. Their feeding areas are often some distance away from the areas they choose to nest. One of the numerous subspecies of this bird, the dusky seaside sparrow (A. m. nigrescens), has recently become extinct, and the Cape Sable subspecies, A. m. mirabilis, is endangered.

It was producer Joe Meek's first #1 production. Recounting the haunting ‚Äì real or imagined ‚Äì of a young man by his dead lover, the song is one of the most noted of the 'death ditties' that populated the pop charts, on both sides of the Atlantic, in the early to mid-1960s. It is distinguished in particular by its eerie, echoing sound (a hallmark of Meek's production style) and by the ghostly, foreboding female wails that form its backing vocal, by Lissa Gray. The recording was arranged by Charles Blackwell. Despite the line, \\"the girl I loved who died a year ago\\" being changed to the more vague \\"the girl I loved and lost a year ago\\", the song was banned by the BBC, along with many other 'death discs', which were popular at the time. Creation and success The song was written and composed by Geoff Goddard who awoke inspired and sang it straight into the tape recorder which he kept by his bedside. At the time of the recording, John Leyton played a rock star called \\"Johnny Saint-Cyr\\" in the TV series Harpers West One. In an episode of the show Saint-Cyr performs the song, surrounded by adoring female fans. The television exposure caused the song to become instantly well known. After it was released, it rapidly rose to the number one spot.Arena, The Strange Story of Joe Meek, BBC, 1991.

An industrial rail siding alongside Stockton Street between 4th and 5th Streets. The Richmond Union Passenger Railway, in Richmond, Virginia, was the first practical electric trolley (tram) system, and set the pattern for most subsequent electric trolley systems around the world. It is an IEEE milestone in engineering. The Richmond system was not the first attempt to operate an electric trolley. According to the IEEE, there were at least 74 earlier attempts to provide electric trolley service in over 60 communities in North America, the United Kingdom, and continental Europe. However, these earlier attempts were not reliable enough to replace the existing animal-hauled street railways. The Richmond system was designed by Frank Julian Sprague. After trials in late 1887, it began regular operation on February 2, 1888, with 10 streetcars. Electric power was supplied through overhead trolley wires (450 volts) for two motors on each car. Large cars weighed , provided 40 seats, and carried up to 100 passengers; small cars weighed with 22 seats and up to 65 passengers. Running speed was , with as a maximum speed. By June 1888 the system contained 40 cars running on some of track, including steep grades, and with 30 degree or minimum radius curves. Its success proved that electric traction was both safe and reliable. The Boston City Council, after inspecting Richmond's system on September 7, 1888, approved construction the second such project by the West End Street Railway. Boston's trolley was closely patterned upon Richmond's, and again demonstrated its practicality. By 1895 almost 900 electric street railways and nearly of track had been built in the United States, and in a little over a decade animal-powered street railways had essentially vanished. Richmond's electric trolley service ended on November 25, 1949. It would not be until 2018 that the city would once again be served by rapid transit, when the GRTC Pulse opened.

Overview During the 1900-1901 excavation season in Egypt, John Garstang examined sites north of Abydos for the Egyptian Research Account, covering the land between the villages of Alawniyeh and Bet Khallaf (Bayt KhallƒÅf), including the modern settlements of El Mahasna (Al Ma·∏©ƒÅsinah); Bet Allam; Maslahet Harum; Bet; and Ilg. The expedition camp was based near the walled village of Maslahet-Harun, south of El Mahasna. Between the villages of Alawniyeh and Bet Allam they discovered traces of a prehistoric cemetery (site L) which had almost been completely plundered. Between Maslahet Harum and El Mahasna they excavated the site of a prehistoric settlement (site M S) and a necropolis dating from the 4th-11th Dynasty (site M). They also examined a nearby site (site N) containing burials dating from the same period. By the end of January 1901, it was decided to investigate a large brick structures standing in the desert near the village of Bet Khallaf (site K), which Garstang discovered to be the site several mastaba tombs dating from the 3rd Dynasty. Based upon a seal impression discovered in tomb K1 inscribed with the name of king Neter-khet (Netjerkhet or Djoser), Garstang believed the tomb was the burial place of the king (though he is more usually believed to have been buried in the step pyramid in the Saqqara necropolis, Egypt), but it is now generally believed that it is more likely that they were private tombs of the same period. Another inscription discovered in tomb K2 lead Garstang to the assumption that it was the tomb of Hen-nekht (Sa-nekht), thought to be the predecessor of Nejterkhet. Garstang also discovered smaller tombs at the site which he believed to be the tombs of servants of Netjerkhet. Possible skull of Pharaoh Sanakht (Hen Nekht) from mastaba K2 at Beit Khallaf. The largest tomb, K1, rises 8 metres above the desert and covers an area of over 3800 square meters. A two metre thick outer wall holds the filling with sand and stone and huge brickwork are made around pits and corners. The burial shaft lies 25 metres below the surface at the bottom of a stairway which was blocked by six massive stones. The ceiling above the stairway was constructed of descending barrel vaults supported by mud brick arches and are thought to be the oldest known vaults in Egypt. Nearly 800 cylindrical alabaster vases were removed from the stairway, including some with mud caps sealed with the name of 'Neter-Khet' (Netjerikhet). The burial chamber comprised 18 chambers leading out from a central passage. Unfortunately the burial has been disturbed by plunderers who had dug a small hole underneath the mastaba, and the bones were scattered and offering vessels were 'strewn about in confusion'. The second largest tomb, K2, was of a similar design to K1, contained human remains and a small fragment inscribed with the name of 'Hen-nekht' or 'sa-nekht' (Sanakht).

Rudolf Eitelberger, full name Rudolf Eitelberger von Edelberg (17 April 1817 in Olomouc, Moravia ‚Äì 18 April 1885 in Vienna) was an art historian and the first Ordinarius (full professor) for art history at the University of Vienna. He is considered as the founder of the Vienna School of Art History. Life Eitelberger, the son of a military officer, studied law and the Romance languages at University of Olomouc. From 1839 through 1848 he was a lecturer in philology at the University of Vienna. In the meantime he educated himself in the history of art, mounting an exhibit of old master paintings in 1846 and serving as a Privatdozent (private lecturer) in art history. Eitelberger was a committed reformist throughout the Vorm√§rz, and during the events of 1848 served as the editor of the Wiener Zeitung, a pro- revolutionary literary journal. He was particularly concerned with the role of art history in the education of artists; also in 1848 he published a polemic against the pedagogical methods of Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller, at that time director of the Academy of Fine Arts. After the failure of the revolution, in 1850, Eitelberger delivered a series of lectures on art history, the first of which was entitled \\"Die Bildungsanstalten f√ºr K√ºnstler und ihre historische Entwicklung\\" (\\"Institutions for the education of artists and their historical development\\"). Eitelberger's activities attracted the attention of the Austrian Minister for Religion and Education, Count Leopold Thun-Hohenstein, who attempted to secure him a position as professor of art history at the University. However, Eitelberger's theories and political activity remained controversial, and his appointment was initially vetoed by Emperor Franz Joseph. Thun resubmitted his petition, and on 5 November 1852 Eitelberger was named Professor f√ºr Kunstgeschichte und Kunstarch√§ologie (Professor of the History of Archaeology of Art) at the University of Vienna. He thus became one of the first professors of art history in Europe. Gustav Friedrich Waagen had been appointed to a similar chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin in 1844, and the appointment of Eitelberger may have represented a Habsburg attempt to keep pace with the cultural policies of Prussia. Eitelberger's activities as professor embraced both scholarly and practical, educational endeavors. Together with Gustav Heider he published a two-volume corpus of the Mittelalterliche Kunstdenkm√§ler des √∂sterreichischen Kaiserstaates (Medieval monuments of the Austrian Empire), and in 1871 he founded the series Quellenschriften f√ºr Kunstgeschichte (Source Texts for Art History). In the practical realm, Eitelberger and Jakob Falke co-founded in 1864 the k.k. √ñsterreichisches Museum f√ºr Kunst und Industrie (Imperial Austrian Museum for Art and Industry), today the √ñsterreichisches Museum f√ºr angewandte Kunst (Austrian Museum for Applied Art), which was inspired by the South Kensington Museum in London. In 1868 he founded the museum's educational component, the Kunstgewerbeschule, today the Universit√§t f√ºr angewandte Kunst (University for Applied Art). Legacy Eitelberger insisted on the priority of the object in the history of art, and therefore lectured exclusively in the galleries of his museum. This insistence on the close attention to the visual properties of works of art became a characteristic of the Vienna School of Art History, and was continued by Eitelberger's students and successors, Moritz Thausing, Franz Wickhoff, and Alois Riegl. Eitelberger's simultaneous interest in the historical context of objects, expressed in his series of Quellenschriften, also became a hallmark of the Vienna School, and was pursued in particular by Julius von Schlosser. Eitelberger's commitment to the training of contemporary artists, and his insistence on the importance of the art of the past for art of the present, rendered him a central figure in the historicist movement in 19th-century Austria. He conceived art history and the practice of art as a unity, a principle expressed in his maxim: \\"He who wishes to pursue art history must possess a natural inclination towards art itself.\\"\\"Man mu√ü f√ºr Kunst selbst veranlagt sein, wenn man Kunstgeschichte treiben will.\\" Quoted in Lachnit, Die Wiener Schule, p. 24.

Timber is converted to woodchips and sold, primarily, for paper manufacture. In Australia, woodchips are produced by clearcutting or thinning of native forests or plantations. In other parts of the world, forestry practices such as short rotation coppice are the usual methods adopted. Uses of wood chips includes the manufacture of particle board (or \\"chip board\\") and other engineered woods, mulch and fuel. Sources and process Historically, the primary sources of wood chips in Australia have been the extensive Eucalyptus hardwood forests found throughout temperate areas of the country. In more recent times, a significant proportion comes from managed hardwood and softwood plantations. During the late 1960s and 1970s, the high demand for paper and the relatively low cost and availability of the native forests made the establishment of a woodchipping industry a viable proposition. Conversely, the establishment of a woodchipping industry made it economically feasible to clearfell areas of mixed or substandard forest that could not otherwise have been felled. Clearfelling is a controversial forest practice in Australia, and opponents argue that the woodchipping industry is culpable for its continuation. Woodchips are converted into a fibre that can be made into various grades of paper or rayon for the textile industry. Most processing and value adding takes place outside of Australia. The Australian economy benefits directly from a low-cost and high-volume export commodity.  Usage  Wood chips, as a byproduct of the timber industry, have been used in many ways for centuries, for example as a material for the production of wallpaper or as a disposable floor covering in butchers shop or drinking houses. Wood pulp is the primary market for the woodchipping industry in Australia. The practice, known as woodchipping, was to make use of most of the woody material in a tree to produce wood chips. This was then converted into paper, hardwood pulp is mainly used for printing paper and softwood pulp is added for good quality. An energy-intensive process, it also involved the use of bleaches and other toxic chemicals. This stage of the process, known as Kraft pulping, was primarily performed in Japan and elsewhere. High demand for paper products had purpose-built bulk carriers increase the export of woodchips from Australia to Japan. The separation of the chipping stage and the pulping and paper mills required the supply of energy usually sourced from byproducts of the process. Additional energy expenditure is found in the shipping of raw materials and export of the finished product.  Criticism and environmental opposition  The introduction of the wood chip industry to Western Australia in the 1960s initially attracted less opposition than it did in the eastern states. At first it was seen as an opportunity for the economic development of the south west; it was not until the 1970s that an environmental movement against it began to emerge. The volatility of the issue became apparent in 1976 when two activists carried out the Bunbury woodchip bombing, a failed attempt to disable woodchip exporting facilities for 18 months.

In the late 1950s, Davison played drums in various skiffle groups in and around the youth clubs in north-west London, especially around Baker Street. He rose to prominence drumming in the 1960s in Mark Leeman Five and then progressive rock group Shinn with keyboard player Don Shinn and bassist Paul Newton (later with Uriah Heep) and finally The Nice with keyboardist Keith Emerson, guitarist David O'List and bassist Lee Jackson. After the breakup of The Nice, Davison formed a short-lived band called Brian Davison's Every Which Way featuring ex-Skip Bifferty lead singer Graham Bell. The band broke up after one album.Joseph Murrells -The Book of Golden Discs -1978 Page 291 \\"The first recording of the poem, entitled 'Child of the Universe' featuring the 'Desiderata' words and set to a tune by singer Graham Bell, seems to be that by the British group Every Which Way in September 1970 formed by ex-Nice drummer Brian Davison, on their first and only album.\\" He then joined Jackson and keyboardist Patrick Moraz in Refugee.

Biography He was born Keith Anthony Joseph Jackson in Newcastle upon Tyne. Jackson first played with unknown bands, The Vondykes and the Invaders. He then joined Gary Farr and the T-Bones, meeting their organist Keith Emerson. The two met again later, to form a backing band for American singer P. P. Arnold: she had been with the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, and was starting a solo career in England. The Nice were formed by Emerson and Jackson, with guitarist David O'List and Ian Hague on drums, soon to be replaced by Brian Davison. Emerson left the band to form Emerson, Lake & Palmer in 1970; Jackson subsequently formed the band Jackson Heights with Charlie Harcourt on guitars, Mario Enrique Covarrubias Tapia on bass and Spanish guitars and Tommy Sloane on drums. Jackson Heights disbanded after their first album King Progress in 1970. Jackson reformed the band, with keyboardist Brian Chatton (ex-Warriors and ex-Flaming Youth) and John McBurnie on acoustic guitar, keyboards and vocals. Michael Giles played drums on the next three albums, but the band toured as a trio without drums. On their last record, \\"Bump n' grind\\", Ian Wallace (ex-King Crimson as Giles was) and Deep Purple's Ian Paice shared drums with Michael Giles. Jackson went on to form the band Refugee, with drummer Brian Davison from The Nice and Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz. They released one album before Moraz quit to join Yes. Jackson and Davison reformed The Nice again with Emerson, accompanied by The Keith Emerson Band, for a tour of England in 2002; a live album Vivacitas was recorded and published that same year. Lee Jackson has played bass in a New Orleans-style rock 'n' roll and jazz band, called the Ginger Pig, based in Northampton, for more than twenty years since returning to the UK. He also formed a small combo called 'Lee Jackson's Barking Spyders', with members of a Beatles tribute band called Accrington Stanley. He has a hoarse singing voice (which has frequently drawn criticism, notably from Emerson[ The Nice biography at Allmusic]) and an almost percussive bass playing style.

They specialize in the ephemeral sculpture materials of Sand, Snow, Ice & Fire, attending sculpture festivals and symposia all over the world and also the production of art based documentaries and films. The origins of their involvement in this area stemmed from in an invitation to participate in an international Sand Sculpture event which arrived at the university for Fergus Mulvaney, back in 1993. After this introduction more invitations came which allowed the three members of Duthain Dealbh, Magee, Doyle and Magee to be introduced to the various ephemeral media. Over the last number of years Duthain Dealbh has also branched into Ice sculpting, participating successfully in many competitions and festivals around the world. Their first Film/Documentary Production, \\"Cool Carvings\\" was extremely well received and had its first airing on TG4 in 2003, and also received great praise when it was screened at the ƒ∞zmir International Film Festival in Turkey in 2004.

His name is also spelt as Sylvester Petra Sancta, Petrasancta, in Italian Padre Silvestro da Pietrasanta. Pseudonym: Coelius Servilius Biography He was the confessor of the Cardinal Pier Luigi Carafa (1581-1655) from a distinguished Neapolitan family. Between 1624 and 1634, Petra Sancta stayed with Carafa in Cologne where he fought against rising Protestantism through his sermons and religious discussions. He had emblem books published in 1634 and 1638, respectively. He was also Rector of the College of Loreto. Later he settled in Rome and published his treatise on heraldry there. During the mid-1620s, he published a translation in Li√®ge.Jacobus Fuligattus, Silvester Petra Sancta: Vita Roberti Bellarmini Politiani e Societate Iesv S.R.E. Presbyteri Cardinalis Archiepiscopi Capuae Fidei Propvgnatoris. Leodii, 1626. Translated by Petra Sancta from the original Italian work by J. Fuligatto (1577-1653). The frontispiece was covered with blind coat of arms and undefined coat of arms on the covers. The frontispiece was engraved by the outstanding Flemish artist Jan Valdor (1600-1650). The book is about the life of the Jesuit monk cardinal Roberto Francesco Romolo Bellarmino (1542-1621) who was the head of the Sanctum Officium (the Roman Inquisition) and had respect for the scientific achievements of Galileo and was anxious about the dullness of his co-workers. After his death the Inquisition was shifted towards a more extremist direction. On August 8, 1642, the Inquisition arrested and imprisoned the founder of the Piarist Order Joseph Calasanz (1557-1648) and his co-workers. Petra Sancta was appointed on May 9, 1643 as the apostolic visitator for the Piarist Order. and since 1631 he was also the editor of a book published from Antwerp. That means during the late 1620s and the early 1630s he stayed in the Spanish Low Countries and the neighboring territories. In 1634 he published his first book touching the topic of heraldry in Antwerp; but his main heraldic work containing the hatching system was published in 1638 in Rome. In 1643, he was appointed the Apostolic Visitator for the Order of Piarists. As a result of his critical visitation, Pope Innocent X reduced the order in his breve Ea quae pro felice on March 16, 1646 into a secular congregation subordinated to the local bishops. The order was rehabilitated in 1656 and renewed in 1669. The dispute between Petra Sancta and de la Colombi√®re Today Petra Sancta is known primarily as the inventor of the modern hatching method in heraldry published in 1638.Tesserae gentilitiae ex legibus fecialium descriptae. Rome, 1638 However, his hatching system is identical with that of de la Colombi√®re from 1639.Recueil de plusieurs pi√®ces et figures d'armoiries obmises par les autheurs qui ont escrit jusques icy de cette science, blasonn√©es par le sieur Vulson de La Colombi√®re,... suivant l'art des anciens roys d'armes, avec un discours des principes et fondemens du blason, et une nouvelle m√©thode de cognoistre les m√©taux et couleurs sur la taille-douce. Paris, 1639. For this reason, de la Colombi√®re accused Silvester Petra Sancta of copying his method and incorrectly publishing it in his 1638 work, one year before the same hatching system was published by de la Colombi√®re. Petra Sancta provided preliminary comprehensive studies on his heraldic work in Germany and the Netherlands. It is likely that he was acquainted with the idea of hatching and the earlier existing hatching methods from the Dutch engravers before he developed his own hatching system. His 1638 book is sometimes dated between 1636 and 1638. His earlier work De Symbolis Heroicis, Libri IX (Antverpiae, 1634) already had a hatching table and a description of hatching system, but without any practical use. For example, the gules in the Carafa coat of arms being variably screened by vertical and horizontal lines (modern sable), vertical lines (modern gules), or horizontal lines (modern azure). According to the data from the Plantin-Moretus archive, the book emblems were firstly prepared by artist-engravers in the service of the Jesuits. Between December 1631 and June 1634 these were redone by Andr√© Pauwels (Andries Pauli, 1600-1639) for Balthasar Moretus (1574-1641). The allegorical title page of this book was prepared by Rubens where Mercury symbolizes the arts. The explanation on the mentioned engraving is given in page 480 of the book. Petra Sancta characterizes the title page of this book in the conclusion as an expression of the power of emblematic way of illustration. The book also contains the portrait of Carafa, engraved in 1632 by Michel Natalis (Li√®ge, 1610‚Äì1668). On the escutcheon of this engraving we can see a kind of a screening or hatching as well. Thus it‚Äôs obvious that Petra Sancta got the model for his heraldic hatching system from the illustrators and publishers of his books in the Low Countries. It is possible that these engravers also knew at least two earlier hatching systems by Zangrius in 1600, and Francquart in 1623. The techniques of heraldic hatching might have even been carried forward by the guilds of engravers one after another. The arms on the title page of one of the Francesco Corbelletti‚Äôs 1639 publications, Francesco Liberati, La perfettione del cavallo... Roma: Per gli Heredi di Francesco Corbelletti, 1639 i. e. the Rome publisher of Petra Sancta, already represents a complete example of heraldic hatching. That means Corbelletti took over the heraldic hatching system already in the next year after the 1638 system of Petra Sancta appeared. If we consider the time needed to prepare the engravings and the approval by the censor, Corbelletti must have known the hatching system of Petra Sancta even before 1638. Aegidius Gelenius was deeply influenced by Petra Sancta; the men met several times in Cologne. Gelenius's hatching system from 1645, however, is identical only at two points with that of Petra Sancta. Works *Silvestro Pietrasanta: Iter Fuldense ...

He was the father of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Life and career Churchill was the son of Sir John Churchill of Dorset, a lawyer and politician, and his wife Sarah Winston, daughter of Sir Henry Winston. Churchill was educated at St John's College, Oxford, but he left university without taking a degree. The main reason of it was the beginning of the Civil War. Churchill was a fervent Royalist throughout his life. He fought and was wounded in the Civil War as a captain in the King's Horse and, after the Royalists were defeated, was forced to pay a recompense fee of ¬£446 (equivalent to around ¬£44,600 in the present day). After the Restoration, he sat as a Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis from 1661 to 1679 and for Lyme Regis from 1685 to 1688. History of Parliament Online - Churchill, Winston He was also a Commissioner of the Irish Court of Claims and Explanations between 1662 and 1668, and a Junior Clerk Comptroller to the Board of Green Cloth from 1664 to 1679. Churchill was knighted in 1664 and made a Fellow of the Royal Society the same year. He also published a history of the kings of England, entitled Divi Britannici; being a remark upon the Lives of all the Kings of this Isle, from the year of the World 2855 until the year of Grace 1660.

Four of their children gained distinction: * John Churchill (1650‚Äì1722) became a famous military commander and was created Duke of Marlborough; *George Churchill (1654‚Äì1710) became an admiral in the Royal Navy and never married; * Charles Churchill (1656‚Äì1714) became a general in the British Army under his eldest brother and married Mary Gould (later married to the 2nd Earl of Abingdon); * Arabella Churchill (1648‚Äì1730) became a mistress of King James II and mother of four of his children; among her descendants are Earl Waldegrave; the Earls Spencer; the Dukes of Berwick, and the later Dukes of Alba; Viscount Falmouth. A common theme is rather obvious with Churchill's surviving children. Arabella became mistress of James, Duke of York in about 1665. In 1667, on most accounts, James obtained a commission for John in the Guards and, in 1675, John was commissioned captain in the Duke of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment.

George although pursuing a mainly Admiralty career, was commissioned Ensign (1676) and Lieutenant (1678) in the Duke of York's Regiment. Jasper was commissioned ensign in 1678, in the Duke of York's Regiment.

It was capital of a very big region for centuries under the Delhi Sultanate and Jaunpur Sultanate rule. Name It has been sometimes spelt at Karrah, Kada and Kurrah but actually it is Kara (in Hindi ‡§ï‡§°‡§º‡§æ and Urdu ⁄©⁄ë€Å ) and often called with its sister town across the river Ganges, Manikpur. To this day, it is called Kara-Manikpur. Kara falls in Kaushambi district while Manikpur has now become a part of Pratapgarh district.  Overview  Pen-and- ink and wash drawing of the Ganges below the town of Kara, 1803 Centuries ago it was the seat of the Governor of the Sirkar of Kara (\\"the Province of Kara\\"). Between the 7th century and the 16th century it retained its charm and importance as the capital, but in 1526, the Mughal emperor Akbar made Allahabad the capital and thus reduced Kara to a subdivision of the province. During British Rule, Allahabad gained so much importance that Kara went into oblivion and today it is a town of dilapidated havelis, forts, and monuments unknown. Hundreds of thousands of graves are in an area with a diameter of 7‚Äì8 km (5 miles). This stunning fact emboldens its claim that it had been certainly inhabited by many people during its history. In the 11th century the warrior saint of Islam, Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud defeated the princes of Manikpur and Kara, but Muhammadan rule was not established till the defeat of Jayachandra by Muhammad Ghori. Manikpur and Kara on the opposite bank of the Ganges were important seats of government in the early Muhammadan period. Ala- ud-din Khalji was governor here, before he gained the throne of Delhi by murdering his uncle on the sands of the river between these two places. In the 15th century the district came under the rule of the Sharqi kings of Jaunpur, and after its restoration to Delhi the Rajput chiefs and the Muhammadan governors were frequently in revolt. The Afghans long retained their hold on the District, and early in the reign of Akbar, the governor of Manikpur rebelled. Kara lost its importance when Allahabad became the capital of a Province, and from that time it was merely the chief town of a sarkar. The Rajputs again rose during the anarchy which marked the disruption of the empire after the death of Aurangzeb. They were, however, gradually reduced by the Nawabs of Oudh, and in 1759 Kara was removed from the Sufrah of Allahabad. Many noble Muslim families had settled there. With the passage of time they left the town due to the lack of civic amenities and the disinterest of the government for the upkeep and development of the town. Shah Karak Abdal, a famous sufi saint lies buried here whose annual Urs is the largest Urs in the area of Allahabad. Kara has been a place of pilgrimage since at least A.D. 1000. It is the site of the holy temple of Kara Devi (Shitala Devi). Once the provincial capital of the Delhi Sultanate, its ruins extend . Kara was also an important township in the medieval kingdoms of northern India and even today one can see the remains of the fort of Jaichand of Kannauj, the last Hindu king of Kannauj. Places of historical interest include; the Dargah of Khwaja Karak, the Kara Devi Temple, the Samadhi of Saint Maluk Das, a mound called fort of Jai Chand, Jama Masjid, Kshetrapal Bharav Temple, Kaleshwar Mahadev Temple, and Shivala Maharishi Ashram.

Born in Freshford, County Kilkenny, Kavanagh first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St. Kieran's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He joined the senior team during the 1998 championship. Kavanagh immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won seven All-Ireland medals, ten Leinster medals and five National League medals on the field of play. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Kavanagh won two Railway Cup medals. At club level he is an All-Ireland medallist with St. Lachtain's in the intermediate grade. In addition to this he has also won a set of Leinster and championship medals. Throughout his career Kavanagh made 48 championship appearances. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 9 February 2012. In 2002 Kavanagh won the first of four All-Star awards. He was also chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all-time in a 2009 poll. That same year Kavanagh was chosen on the Leinster team of the past twenty-five years. In retirement from playing Kavanagh became involved in team management and coaching. In 2015 he was appointed trainer to the Wicklow senior team. Playing career =Colleges= During his schooling at St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny, Kavanagh established himself as a key member of the senior hurling team. In 1996 he won his sole Leinster medal as Good Counsel College were narrowly defeated by 1-7 to 1-6. St. Colman's College provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. A 1-14 to 2-6 victory gave Kavanagh an All- Ireland medal. = University = During his studies at the Waterford Institute of Technology, Kavanagh was an automatic inclusion on the college hurling team. In 2004 he was at right corner-back as WIT faced University College Cork in the final of the Fitzgibbon Cup. Two goals from Declan Browne in a six-minute spell before half-time gave WIT a commanding lead. Neil Ronan bagged a fourth goal straight after the interval which helped WIT to a 4-15 to 3-12 victory. Kavanagh lined out in a second successive Fitzgibbon Cup decider in 2000. University College Dublin were the opponents on that occasion, however, a 2-10 to 1-6 victory gave WIT the victory. It was Kavanagh's second Fitzgibbon Cup medal. =Club= After a lengthy career with St. Lachtain's, Kavangh lined out in his first intermediate decider in 2009. A narrow 0-16 to 1-11 defeat of Dicksboro gave him a championship medal. Kavanagh later added a Leinster medal to his collection when St. Lachtain's secured a 1-8 to 0-7 defeat of Mount Leinster Rangers to take the provincial title for the first time. On 13 February 2010 St. Lachtain's faced St. Gall's in the All-Ireland decider. John Fitzpatrick (two) and Ollie O‚ÄôConnor hit the goals that helped secure a comprehensive 3-17 to 0-10 victory and an All-Ireland Intermediate Club Hurling Championship medal for Kavanagh. =Inter-county= Minor and under-21 Kavanagh first played for Kilkenny in 1995 when he joined the minor side. He won his first Leinster medal that year following a 4-16 to 2-6 defeat of Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Kilkenny against old rivals Cork, with Kavanagh lining out at right corner-back. The game turned into a rout as Cork won easily by 2-10 to 1-2. In 1996 Kavanagh won his second Leinster medal, as Dublin were accounted for on a 1-16 to 1-11 score line. The All-Ireland campaign came to an end at the semi-final stage. Kavanagh was eligible for the minor grade again in 1997. A 3-16 to 1-10 defeat of Offaly gave him a third successive Leinster medal, however, his quest for an All-Ireland medal came to an end at the semi-final stage. In 1998 Kavanagh was drafted onto the Kilkenny under-21 team. A 2-10 to 0-12 defeat of Dublin in the provincial decider gave him his first Leinster medal in that grade. Kavanagh won a second Leinster medal in 1999, following a 1-17 to 1-6 trouncing of Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland decider was a thrilling affair, with Kilkenny securing a narrow 1-13 to 0-14 defeat of Galway to give Kavanagh his sole All-Ireland medal. Unsuccessful beginnings Kavanagh was just out of the minor grade when he joined the Kilkenny senior team in 1999. He made his senior championship debut on 31 May 1998 in a 4-23 to 0-14 Leinster quarter-final defeat of Dublin. Kavanagh later won his first Leinster medal following a 3-10 to 1-11 defeat of Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 13 September 1998 saw both sides face off against each other in a first all-Leinster affair. Offaly's Brian Whelahan, who was suffering from flu, delivered one of his greatest ever performances. After starting in defence he was later moved to full-forward where he scored 1‚Äì6. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by 2‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì13. Kilkenny gained their revenge on Offaly in the 1999 provincial final. A huge 5‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì16 victory over their near rivals gave Kilkenny the win and gave Kavanagh a second Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Kilkenny face Cork on 12 September 1999. In a dour contest played on a wet day, Cork trailed by 0-5 to 0-4 after a low-scoring first half. Kilkenny increased the pace after the interval, pulling into a four-point lead. Cork moved up a gear and through Joe Deane, Ben O'Connor and Se√°nie McGrath Cork scored five unanswered points. Kilkenny could only manage one more score ‚Äì a point from a Henry Shefflin free ‚Äì and Cork held out to win by 0-13 to 0-12. Early successes In 2000 Kavanagh won a third successive Leinster medal following another comfortable 2‚Äì21 to 1‚Äì13 victory over Offaly. As a result of the so-called \\"back-door\\" system both sides later faced off against each other again in the All-Ireland final on 10 September 2000. D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for 'the Cats'. Carey scored 2‚Äì4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì14 and Kavanagh collected his first All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny's provincial dominance continued in 2001 and a powerful 2-19 to 0-12 defeat of Wexford gave Kavanagh a fourth Leinster medal. Kilkenny bounced back in 2002. Kavanagh won his first National League medal, as a late Brian Dowling free secured a narrow 2-15 to 2-14 victory. He later collected a fifth Leinster medal as Kilkenny recorded a narrow 0-19 to 0-17 defeat of fourteen- man Wexford. On 8 September 2002 Kavanagh lined out in his fourth All-Ireland decider as Kilkenny faced first-round losers Clare. Kilkenny forwards Henry Shefflin and D. J. Carey combined to score 2-13 between them, as Kilkenny secured a 2-20 to 0-19 victory. It was a second All-Ireland medal for Kavanagh while he was later honoured with his first All-Star award. In 2003 Kavanagh won a second league medal as Kilkenny came back from eight points down to secure a stunning 5-14 to 5-13 extra-time defeat of Tipperary. He later won a sixth successive Leinster medal, as Kilkenny defeated Wexford by 2-23 to 2-12. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 14 September 2003 saw Kilkenny face Cork for the first time in four years. Both teams remained level for much of the game, exchanging tit-for-tat scores. A Setanta √ì hAilp√≠n goal gave Cork the advantage, however, a Martin Comerford goal five minutes from the end settled the game as Kilkenny went on to win by 1-14 to 1-11. It was Kavanagh's third All-Ireland medal. He was later honoured with his second All-Star award. After facing a shock, last-minute 2-15 to 1-16 defeat by Wexford in the Leinster semi-final in 2004, Kilkenny worked their way through the qualifiers and lined out against Cork in the All-Ireland decider on 12 September 2004. The game was expected to be a classic, however, a rain-soaked day made conditions difficult as Kilkenny aimed to secure a third successive championship. The first half was a low-scoring affair and provided little excitement for fans, however, the second half saw Cork completely take over. For the last twenty-three minutes Cork scored nine unanswered points and went on to win the game by 0-17 to 0-9. Kilkenny were back in form in 2005, with Kavanagh winning a third National League medal following a 3‚Äì20 to 0‚Äì15 victory over Clare. \\"The Cats\\" later struggled against a wasteful Wexford side, however, a 0-22 to 1-16 victory gave Kavanagh a seventh Leinster medal. While a third successive All-Ireland showdown with Cork seemed likely, Galway defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final in one of the games of the decade. Four-in-a-row In 2006 Kavanagh captured a fourth National League title following a 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì14 victory over Limerick. After missing the Leinster final triumph, Kavanagh was back on the starting fifteen for the All-Ireland final. The game that everyone had predicted would happen in 2005 was now taking place as Cork squared up to Kilkenny for the third time in four years. The Leesiders were aiming for a third All-Ireland victory in-a-row; however, revenge was foremost in the minds of Kilkenny as it was Cork who denied their three-in-a-row bid in 2004. On the day Kilkenny were far too strong for Cork as 'the Cats' secured a 1‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì13 victory. It was Kavanagh's fourth All-Ireland winners' medal. Kavanagh collected an eighth Leinster medal in 2007, as Kilkenny asserted their provincial dominance and defeated Wexford by 2-24 to 1-12. On 2 September 2007 Kilkenny faced defeated Munster finalists and surprise All-Ireland semi-final winners Limerick in the championship decider. Kilkenny got off to a flying start with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin scoring two goals within the first ten minutes to set the tone. Limerick launched a second-half comeback, however, \\"the Cats\\" were too powerful and cruised to a 2-19 to 1-15 victory. It was Kavanagh's fifth All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny secured the Leinster crown again in 2008, with Kavanagh collecting a ninth winners' medal following a 5-21 to 0-17 drubbing of Wexford. On 8 September 2008 Kilkenny faced Waterford in the All-Ireland decider for the first time in forty-five years. In a disappointingly one-sided final, Kilkenny produced a near perfect seventy minutes as Waterford endured a nightmare afternoon. A 23-point winning margin, 3-24 from play, only two wides in the entire match and eight scorers in all with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin leading the way in a 3-30 to 1-13 victory. It was Kavanagh's sixth All-Ireland medal. Kavanagh collected a fifth National League medal in 2009, as Kilkenny beat Tipperary by 2-26 to 4-17 with a thrilling extra-time victory. He later won a fifth successive Leinster medal, his tenth overall, as new challengers Dublin were bested by 2-18 to 0-18. On 6 September Kilkenny were poised to become the second team ever in the history of hurling to win four successive All-Ireland championships when they faced Tipperary in the decider. For long periods Tipp looked the likely winners, however, late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their efforts to secure a 2-22 to 0-23 victory. Kavanagh had collected his seventh All-Ireland medal. Twilight success In 2010 Kavanagh was dropped from the Kilkenny starting fifteen, however, he remained on the extended panel. Kilkenny faced a number of injury worries going into an historic All-Ireland final, and ultimately failed in their 'drive for five' as Tipperary won by 4‚Äì17 to 1-18. Following this defeat it was incorrectly reported that Kavanagh had retired from inter-county hurling. Kavanagh remained on the Kilkenny panel for the 2011 championship. That year Kilkenny qualified for a record sixth consecutive All-Ireland final. For the third year in succession the team faced Tipperary, however, on this occasion Kilkenny were slight underdogs going up against the new champions. Kilkenny started quickly and never surrendered the lead in the 2‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì16 victory. Kavanagh played no part in the game, however, he collected his eighth All- Ireland medal as a non-playing substitute. =Inter-provincial= In 1998 Kavanagh was a non-playing substitute on the Leinster team that narrowly defeated Connacht by 0-16 to 2-9 in the final of the Railway Cup. Four years later Kavanagh made it onto the starting fifteen as Leinster faced their age- old rivals Munster in the championship decider. A last-minute free by Henry Shefflin secured a 4-15 to 3-17 victory and a first Railway Cup medal on the field of play for Kavanagh. Kavanagh was captain of the team in 2003 as Leinster faced Connacht in the final. A 4-9 to 2-12 victory gave him a second successive Railway Cup medal. Management career =Wicklow= On 27 January 2015 it was announced that Kavanagh had joined the Wicklow senior hurling management team as trainer. Personal life Born in Freshford, County Kilkenny, Kavanagh was educated at the local national school before later completing his Leaving Certificate at St. Kieran's college. He subsequently completed a degree at the Waterford Institute of Technology, before later becoming a financial adviser.

The school closed in 1990 and Thorntoun is now a nursing home. The complex lies between the villages of Springside (North Ayrshire) and Crosshouse, Kilmarnock in East Ayrshire, Scotland. The old Thorntoun mansion house was demolished in the late 1960s, leaving the West Lodge, some of the home farm outbuildings, the stables and the walled garden as 'memorials' to the ancient history of the site. Many fine trees remain from the estate policies and the surviving gardens are very well maintained (2007). An entrance with a slight deviation from the old course has been created to serve the large modern buildings which house the nursing home. The History of Thorntoun house and estate In 1823 the historian RobertsonRobertson, George (1823). A Genealogical Account of the Principal Families in Ayrshire. Pub. A. Constable, Irvine. describes \\"Thornton\\" as being \\"situated about half way betwixt Irvine and Kilmarnock: the manor or place (palace) is an elegant modern mansion, set down on the brow of a considerable height, overlooking, from amid its fine old timber and more recent plantings, a great expanse of rich country.\\" Thorntoun, 1912, Unmarked, but after the 'd' of Bankhead.

This fact, combined with the consistent spelling over the years suggests that the name relates to 'Thorns' i.e., either Blackthorn (Sloe) or Hawthorn. Both species are still common in the area today. A 'Toun' or 'Ton' was a farm and its outbuildings, originally an area fenced or walled off, with a dwelling within.Warrack, Alexander (1982).\\"Chambers Scots Dictionary\\". Chambers. . } Thorntoun was at first part of the Barony of Kilmaurs and then later it was placed within the Barony of Robertoun, Parish of Kilmaurs. The estate is first recorded as belonging to Murthhaw or Murchaw de Montgomery, who is mentioned in the Ragman Rolls (a list of those loyal to Edward I of England) of 1296. A Johne of Montgomery of Thornetoun is mentioned in a legal document of 1482, forfeiting the estate to Lord Home by order of King James V. By the beginning of the seventeenth century Thorntoun had passed into the ownership of another ancient and renowned Ayrshire family, the Mures (or Muirs), a branch of the Mures of Rowallan Castle near Kilmaurs. James Mure, Burgess of Glasgow, had married Margaret, a daughter of Robert Ross of Thorntoun on 27 June 1607 and inherited the property through his spouse. Nothing is known of how and when the Ross's, another ancient Ayrshire family, had come to possess Thorntoun. Hew (Hugh) was one son, a merchant in Edinburgh, his will is dated 4 Nov 1679 and another son, James succeeded to the property of Thorntoun, and married a Janet Naper, who died in 1626. Robert Muir, son of James & Janet, is mentioned in a document of 1634. =The Cuninghame Family= Archibald Muir of Thorntoun was knighted by King William III in 1698 and his only daughter, Margaret, married John Cuninghame of Caddel, in the Parish of Ardrossan, in 1699. They inherited Thorntoun and Caddel and had two sons and three daughters. Archibald succeeded his father and John became a successful merchant in Lisbon (Portugal), eventually retiring to live at Carmelbank (previously called Mote), adjacent to Thorntoun. Their father was married a second time to a daughter of Mr. Stevenson of Montgreenan, by whom they had another sixteen children. This John Cuninghame died in 1753. The gravestone of the Cuninghame's of Caddel and Thorntoun, Kilmaurs. The Coat of Arms of the Cuninghames of Caddel. Archibald Cuninghame, who was a captain in Boscawen's 29th. Regiment of Foot, married Christiana, eldest daughter of Andrew Macredie of Perceton in 1754. They had three sons, John, Andrew and Archibald and five daughters. Their eldest son was Lieut-Col. John Cuninghame, born in 1756 and died in 1836. He entered the army in 1775 and served in America (now the USA) and the West Indies. He was severely wounded whilst fighting the French in the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. John recovered to serve on board the 74 gun, HMS Montague, at the great Caribbean naval victory of the Battle of the Saintes against the French who were commanded by Admiral Count Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse. He left the army as a lieutenant-colonel in 1802. John's spouse was Sarah Peebles, only daughter of Major John Peebles in Irvine, late of the 42nd regiment, She was born in 1783 and died in 1854. They had nine children, Andrew, John, Archibald, Anna, Christiana, Helen, Margaret, Catherine and Sarah. Many of the family died in childhood or when relatively young. Catherine married Clarence Esme Stuart of Oldenham Abbey, Hertfordshire. Christiana first inherited, followed by Sarah. The colonels' rental value of the property in 1799 was ¬£300 (Scots) per annum, compared with that of the Earl of Eglinton, who had an income of ¬£1,120 (Scots) from his estates.McNaught, *McNaught, Duncan (1912). Kilmaurs Parish and Burgh. Pub. A.Gardner. The Lieut-Col and his family are commemorated and / or buried at the family burial plot in the cemetery of St Maurs-Glencairn kirk in Kilmaurs. =The Wrey Family= Carmel Bank from near Holm Farm. 2007. Sarah Cuninghame's spouse was George Bourchier Wrey from North Devon. They had a son, George Edward Bourchier Wrey who had succeeded to the property by 1912. He appears to have inherited Carmelbank from his great- uncle, John Cuninghame by this date. The combined rental income of Thorntoun and Carmelbank was ¬£2,640 12s 0d., the second highest in the parish, only exceeded by Robert Morris Pollock-Morris of Craig house. This is a reversal for both of the situation in 1799 and may reflect earnings from the establishment of collieries, etc. rather than the straightforward 'traditional' income from farms and the like. =Coat of arms= The coat of arms is a shakefork with a cinquefoil, for Glengarnock: a cross moline within a bordure invected, for Caddel: three stars within a bordure invected, for Muir of Thorntoun; and a crest of a unicorn's head. The motto is \\"Over fork over\\" and as such is unchanged from that of the senior branch, the Cunninghames of Kilmaurs, Earls of Glencairn. The Barony of Robertoun This barony, once part of the Barony of Kilmaurs, ran from Kilmaurs south to the river Irvine. It had no manor house and belonged to the Eglinton family latterly. The following properties were part of the barony: parts of Kilmaurs, Craig, Gatehead, Woodhills, Greenhill, Altonhill, Plann, Hayside, Thorntoun, Rash-hill Park, Milton, Windyedge, Fardelhill, Muirfields, Corsehouse and Knockentiber. The Darien Affair Crosshouse as seen from Thorntoun. The Darien Company was an attempt by the Scots to set up a trading colony in America in the late 1690s, however the opposition from England and elsewhere was so great that the attempt failed with huge losses and great financial implications for the country and for individuals. Half of the whole circulating capital of Scotland was subscribed and mostly lost. In Cunninghame some examples of losses are Sir Archibald Mure of Thorntoun (¬£1000), Major James Cunninghame of Aiket (¬£200), Sir William Cunninghame of Cunninghamhead (¬£1000), William Watson of Tour (¬£150) and James Thomson of Hill in Kilmaurs (¬£100). In modern terms a thousand pounds loss in the 17th century must have been a devastating blow to the family finances.Dobie, James (1876). Pont's Cunninghame topographized 1604-1608 with continuations and illustrative notices (1876). Pub. John Tweed. The journals of Major John Peebles Located in the Cuninghame of Thorntoun Papers in the National Archives of Scotland is the American Revolution journal of Captain John Peebles (1739‚Äì1823), a grenadier officer of the 42nd (Royal Highland Regiment or Black Watch). The journal provides an enlightening insight into the life and activities of the British army during the rebellion. John Peebles was John Cuninghame's father-in-law. In 1780 Captain John Peebles noted in his journal the \\"General Rules for Manouvring the Battn. by the Commanding Officer\\"; appended to these directions are a series of signals for giving orders to the troops. =Signals by drum= The following extracts illustrate the battlefield manoeuvres which drum 'signals' could signal. =The New Jersey Brigade and the Monmouth Campaign= Here are a few extracts from John's American War of Independence journal: [This was the Battle of Monmouth]. Evidence from Ordnance Survey (OS) and other maps William Aiton's map of Ayrshire showing Thornton.

Thomson's map of 1828 gives some detail, showing two entrances and driveways, with substantial woodlands and an enclosed park on the Springside boundary, as used for deer or cattle. He also marks the name 'Mains', indicating the home farm, apparently situated to the right of the house on the 'east' driveway on the Crosshouse side.Thomson, John (1828). A Map of the Northern Part of Ayrshire. This was later rebuilt above the 'West' Lodge (1898 OS), however buildings remain in the 'old' site up until the time of the 1921-28 OS map. This map also indicates a building roughly in the centre of the walled garden. The walls show no signs of typical conservatory-style greenhouses built against them, so this may be a large 'greenhouse'. The stone is red sandstone with freestone corners and coping stones. The materials were landed at Troon harbour and brought here by cart. A 'trig point' is carved on the corner of the walled garden nearest the old quarry.Thompson, George, Head Gardener. Thorntoun Nursing Home. 2007. Oral Communication to Griffith, Roger S. Ll. A well is shown near the walled garden in the vicinity of the modern housing. An old freestone quarry is shown on the 1860 map, close to the trig point on the walled garden. Buildings are indicated on the 1912 OS map as lying fairy close to the northern wall of the walled gardens. Only vague foundations and scattered stones now exist at the site in 2007. The 1912 map appears to show an enclosed area, partially wooded, in the nearby field, of a similar size and shape to the walled garden. This may be a fox covert or cover for pheasants. No sign of this feature is now extant (2007). A small cottage used to stand near the entrance to the new driveway into the nursing home. The 1912 map shows a track running into the estate at this point and this building may have served as a lodge house. The name 'West Lodge' itself suggests that a second lodge existed at one time and the 1911 OS clearly marks this lodge situated at what is now the realigned entrance to the main driveway. A number of local names appear to have been lost, such as Thornhill (1604), Greenside, Hayside, and Laurieslaw from 1828 and Montgomery Holme (1745‚Äì1828). A Laurieland Row, Crawfurdhill and Thorntoun Row were present in 1860. A Thornyhill cottage is however present (2007) near Busbiehill. The Royal Mail re-organised its postal districts in the 1930s and at that point many hamlets and localities ceased to exist officially, such as Sprighill, Corsehill, Bankhead and Kirklands.Strawhorn, John and Boyd, William (1951). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland. Ayrshire. Pub. Edinburgh.Springside's Auld Lang Syne (2002). Springside Women's Health Group. P. 2. The present Springside was called Bankhead up until at least the 1921 - 1928 OS, the hamlet of Springside being originally clustered around the railway station. A number of Lime kilns are marked on 1860 OS, the nearest being at Holme and West Gatehead farms. The turnpike and milestones A typical milestone at Castleton Farm, Stewarton. In 1776Taylor, G. and Skinner, A. (1776) 'Survey and maps of the roads of North Britain or Scotland' Thorntoun is marked on the toll road to Irvine and the two milestones are shown. A horse trough was present on the left of the main road facing Springside, in between the West Lodge and the lane up to Thorntoun Mains; the trough has long vanished, but its niche in the bank with its side walls is still there. This was a turnpike or toll road, with the nearest toll house located at Crosshouse. The 1860 OS map show two milestones were near Thorntoun, one close to the junction of the lane down to Hallbarns and Cauldhame farms and the other on the left facing Crosshouse, before the Holm Burn bridge, indicating to Irvine and three to Kilmarnock. Most milestones were buried during the Second World War so as not to provide assistance to invading troops, German spies, etc. This happened all over Scotland, however Fife at least was more fortunate than Ayrshire, for the stones were taken into storage and put back in place after the war had finished.Stephen, Walter M. (1967-68). Milestones and Wayside Markers in Fife. Proc Soc Antiq Scot, V.100. P. 184. The name 'turnpike' originated from the original 'gate' used being just a simple wooden bar attached at one end to a hinge on the supporting post. The hinge allowed it to 'open' or 'turn' This bar looked like the 'pike' used as a weapon in the army at that time and therefore we get 'turnpike'. The term was also used by the military for barriers set up on roads specifically to prevent the passage of horses. In addition to providing better surfaces and more direct routes, the turnpikes settled the confusion of the different lengths given to miles, which varied from 4,854 to nearly . Long miles, short miles, Scotch or Scot's miles (5,928 ft), Irish miles (6,720 ft), etc. all existed. seems to have been an average! Another important point is that when these new toll roads were constructed the turnpike trusts went to a great deal of trouble to improve the route of the new road and these changes could be quite considerable as the old roads tended to go from farm to farm, hardly the shortest route. The tolls on roads were abolished in 1878 to be replaced by a road 'assessment', which was taken over by the county council in 1889. Natural history Ruscus aculeatus habit The woodland policies contain a mixture of mature oak, Norway maple, beech, copper beech, willow, horse chestnut, aspen, rhododendron, Scots pine, alder, ash, elm, monkey puzzle, willow, sycamore, holy, elder, yew, lime, hawthorn, blackthorn and other species.

P. 76 grows at the walled garden, a relict of the exotic plantings of yesteryear, as is the very unusual stand of Butcher's Broom. The ground flora of the Thorntoun policies is typical of the semi- natural diversity of many deciduous woodlands in Ayrshire, particularly of those associated with current or previous country estates. The bird fauna is quite diverse, including pigeons, rooks, starlings, blackbirds, kestrels, etc. Hedgehogs are present (2007). The Collieries and Coal Pits The 1860, 1898‚Äì1904 and, 1911 and 1912 OS maps all show that the extent to which the Thorntoun House was surrounded by collieries, coal pits and freight only railway or 'tram' lines. Collieries were located near Cauldhame farm (Cauldhame and Springhill (Pit No.4), one at Crosshouse, one at Holme farm and at Bankhead (one called West Thorntoun), Springhill (Pit No.1) and Springhill (Pit No.2) at Sprighill, and another between Busbiehill and Warwickhill. These were all served by standard gauge mineral railway lines, criss-crossing the countryside; they all now lifted, with only a few embankments left to indicate their original course. The Thorntoun colliery beside Holme farm had a miner's row and a railway which ran over several wooden bridges down to join the surviving railway through Gatehead at Holm ley, close to the Laigh Milton viaduct. In 1860 numerous old and current coal pits dotted the area. The bing of Springhill (Pit No.3) still lies close to Springside in the field that may have been the Thorntoun deer park. Miscellaneous and Trivia Thorntoun in the snow. 12 March 2006 Strawhorn Strawhorn, John and Boyd, William (1951). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland. Ayrshire. Pub.

Therefore, 'The fort on the hill'. } The road running down to Springside is known as the 'Thorntoun Brae' and on the left, just before Thorntoun bridge over the Garrier Burn was the local curling pond, clearly marked on the 1911 OS map A mill-wand was the rounded piece of wood acting as an axle with which several people would role a millstone form the quarry to the mill and to permit this the width of some early roads was set at a 'mill-wand breadth'. The nearest mills to Thorntoun were those at Busbie beside Crosshouse and Laigh Milton mill, where the building, weir and part of the wheel still exist (2007). Margaret Muir, was the spouse of Frederick Cunninghame, a merchant in Kilmarnock. She died on 17 March 1685 and could therefore have been a daughter of James Mure and Janet Naper. One of the bells in St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh is inscribed \\"Archibald Mure, Thorntoun, Lord Provost\\" In 1902 a Mrs. Margaret Sturrock, n√©e Finnie was living at Thorntoun House.Springside's Auld Lang Syne (2002).

Letters survive in the National Archives of Scotland concerning the imprisonment of Margaret Cuninghame at Lucca in Tuscany, Italy for evangelical teaching, 1853-1854. The Cuninghames of Thorntoun & Caddel held title to lands in Ayr and tenements in Glasgow, 1573‚Äì1836, including, tacks of lands in Stirling. The estate factors' accounts of Caddell and Thorntoun, survive for the period 1700-1947. Thorntoun house may have been demolished in 1947.

He holds a bachelor's degree in social science (cum laude) from the University of Puerto Rico, Cayey Campus. In 1975 he completed all his partial requirements for obtaining his Master's and Doctorate, simultaneously, in Political Science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). In January 1985, his book The Criminality and Crisis of Prisons in Puerto Rico was published, which has been used by prominent sociologists, criminologists, and jurists in the country's universities. At the age of 30, under the tutelage of one of our best graphic artists, Carlos Irizarry, he started in drawing and painting. He also receives guidance from African- American artists Jamil (Bryson Harris) and Rashid Wright. In recent years, Marcano Garc√≠a founded, in union with Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Danny Rivera, the International Institute of Fine Arts and Music. This novel pedagogical project is inclusive and itinerant in nature, and grants scholarships to talented and resource-poor Latin American youth to study in the field of fine arts and music. Outstanding art critics from the Caribbean region consider the work of Marcano Garc√≠a as exceptional. Currently, important private and public collections, in and out of Puerto Rico contain pieces by this artist. In 2009, together with the young artist Rosana V√°zquez Medina and Nelson D√≠az, he developed his concept of community art (Caribbean Renaissance, Cafetal Urbano, Humacao Vive el Color, Sol Naciente) with which he achieves a living work of great color and enormous emotional impact. He was a Resident Artist of the University of Turabo, an institution with which he collaborated in these last decades. Prominent art critics from the Caribbean region consider Marcano Garc√≠a's work to be exceptional. Currently important private and public collections inside and outside Puerto Rico contain pieces by this artist.  Political activism  In 1978, Pablo, together with Nydia Cuevas Rivera, took hostage the Consul of Chile in the Chilean Consulate in Puerto Rico.They demanded the release of the Puerto Rican political prisoners, and the ceasing of celebrations in the island of 4 July Festivities (as it happened at 3 July). They were arrested after 22 hours in the consulate. For them it would've been 22 years in jail for 22 hours, but the sentence was lowered to seven years only. Pablo was sent to a prison in New York State. When he was released in 1985, a big crowd of people welcomed him at Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport in Puerto Rico. Among them were Rafael Cancel Miranda, Isabel Rosado, and Do√±a Consuelo Ferr√©, among others.  Personal life  He has four children. He has, along with singer Danny Rivera, the Dominican Republic citizenship since 2007. He was granted the UNEAC Honorary Member title. He was the first Puerto Rican to get it.

Early life Linton was born in St. Clair, Michigan and moved with his parents to Saginaw in 1859, where he attended the public schools. He engaged as clerk in a store at Farwell and became engaged in various activities connected with the lumber industry at Wells (now Alger). He was a member of the board of supervisors of Bay County for two terms. He returned to Saginaw in 1878 and engaged in the lumber business with his father and also was connected with other business enterprises. He was a member of the East Saginaw common council in 1884 and 1885. He was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives in 1887 and 1888. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Michigan on the Republican ticket in 1890, losing to Democrat John Strong, Jr. Linton was also president of the Saginaw Water Board and was elected mayor of Saginaw in 1892. Personal life Ida M. Lowry and her daughter Elsie He married Ida M. Lowry, a native of Romero, Michigan, though much of her life had been spent at Saginaw, both before and after her marriage. Mr. Linton was a man of affairs at home, and held the most honorable places of trust in the gift of his city, besides being prominent in Masonic circles and an officer of the organization known as the \\"Independent Order of foresters.\\" They had three children: Ray, the eldest, a younger brother, and Elsie, the only daughter. Career In 1892, running on the Republican Party ticket in Michigan's 8th congressional district, Linton defeated incumbent Democrat Henry M. Youmans, to be elected to the 53rd United States Congress. Linton was re-elected in 1894 to the 54th Congress, serving from March 4, 1893 to March 3, 1897. He was chairman, Committee on Ventilation and Acoustics in the 54th Congress. In 1896, Linton was defeated in the general election by Democrat Ferdinand Brucker. In 1895, Linton along with David Swinton, visited Florida looking for opportunity investing in what was then an unsettled frontier. In West Palm Beach, which was the end of the line for the railroad, they headed south by boat. Linton and Swinton liked what they saw, and purchased what is today, much of Delray Beach, and Boynton Beach. They then returned to Michigan to recruit settlers. By the fall of that same year, they had signed up eight settlers. The settlement called Linton was established within a year, having cleared palmetto growth, planting crops, and establishing a post office and store. However, by 1897, Linton had financial trouble and sold some of his holdings to Nathan Smith Boynton to raise some money. By 1898, Linton's creditors moved to collect from Linton's settlers, who had been under the impression that he already had clear title to the land. Some settlers headed back north, and Linton's reputation suffered. Linton returned to Michigan, and the settlement was renamed Delray after Delray, Michigan the hometown of W.W. Blackmer, one of the original eight settlers.McGoun, William E., Southeast Florida Pioneers: The Palm and Treasure Coasts William S.

The journal publishes articles covering international law, international relations, and related policy issues. Its articles are often interdisciplinary in focus, and the journal's format allows it to examine international legal issues in a broader cultural and political context. The Chicago Journal of International Law is one of the three student-edited law journals published at the University of Chicago Law School. Although relatively young, the journal has quickly gained attention in legal circles as a leading international law journal in terms of scholarly impact and influence. In a 2020 ranking of law journals based on a combination of the impact factor and citations, the Chicago Journal of International Law ranked 2nd among student-edited international and comparative law reviews. The journal's articles are covered by several academic abstracting services, including LegalTrac, EconLit, and CSA Worldwide Political Science Abstracts. The full text of the journal's articles is available via LexisNexis, Westlaw, ProQuest, and HeinOnline.  History  The journal was established during the University of Chicago Law School's 1999-2000 academic year. Its first editor-in-chief was Margaret Peterlin. Since then, it has published seventeen volumes (two issues each) of groundbreaking scholarship in international law with a focus on fields such as law and economics, international administrative law, and human rights. In 2002, when the journal was working on its second volume, it merged with The University of Chicago Law School Roundtable: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Legal Studies. Editor Selection University of Chicago law students are selected to join the journal as staff members each year by that year's incoming managing board of editors through a blind writing competition, held after the participants' first year of law school. The journal also allows law students to \\"write on\\" to the journal, through its Topic Access Program, to become staff members by submitting a publishable piece of legal scholarship. The outgoing managing board selects the next year's editors each spring, generally from among the current staff.

He played college football at Rice University, where he was a consensus All-American in 1954. Early years Moegle attended Taylor High School, where he played football and basketball. He accepted a scholarship from Rice University and attended as a 16-year-old freshman. His play was limited in his sophomore season (1952), after he was lost with a hand cut he suffered trying to open a classroom window that was stuck. In 1953, he teamed up with fullback Dave \\"Kosse\\" Johnson (the nation's second leading rusher), to win a share of the Southwest Conference title with the University of Texas, while registering 833 rushing yards with a 7.3-yard average, which led the nation. In the 1954 Cotton Bowl Classic against Alabama, Moegle was involved in one of college football's most famous plays. With Rice leading 7‚Äì6, Moegle broke through on a sweep from Rice's five-yard line, and was running down the sideline in front of Alabama's bench on his way to a touchdown. Alabama's Tommy Lewis, without putting on his helmet, jumped off the bench and tackled Moegle. Seeing what happened, referee Cliff Shaw awarded a 95-yard touchdown on the play, and Rice went on to win the game 28‚Äì6. Moegle finished with 265 rushing yards, which was a Cotton Bowl Classic record until the 2008 game when Missouri's Tony Temple rushed for 281 yards. He finished with game records of 265 yards on 11 carries for an average of 24.1 yards per attempt and 3 touchdowns. Moegle and Lewis later appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show to talk about the play. As a senior, he rushed 905 yards and led the nation in punt returns. He finished his college career after setting 26 school records, including career touchdowns (22), interceptions in a game (3) and total points in a season (72). In 1979, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. In 1970, he was inducted into the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame. In 1980, he was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career =San Francisco 49ers= Moegle was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round (10th overall) of the 1955 NFL Draft. He entered the league as a 20-year-old rookie and was moved between the offense and the defense, but still recorded 6 interceptions. In 1956, he became the starter at safety, posting 6 interceptions. In 1957, he posted 8 interceptions. The next year, he played in only 4 games after injuring his knee against the Philadelphia Eagles. In 1958, he played in 8 games. On March 13, 1960, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for a first- round draft choice (#6-Jimmy Johnson). =Pittsburgh Steelers= In 1960, he was named the starter at safety and registered 6 interceptions. On December 22, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for offensive tackle Dick Klein and safety Bill Butler. =Dallas Cowboys= After being acquired by the Cowboys in part for being a famous player in the state of Texas, he was named the starter at safety in 1961. At the end of the season, he had surgery on his right foot. On July 30, 1962, he was waived after re-injuring his foot in training camp.

It was the first feature-length film by Sri Lankan director Lester James Peries. The film was well received internationally. It was shown at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and was included in the main competition. It is still the only Sri Lankan film to be nominated for the Palme d'Or. The cinematography was by Wiliam Blake. Despite much acclaim, the film was not a commercial success in Sri Lanka due to its defiance of the mainstream concept of what a film is (i.e. one of a romance between a girl and a boy, fights, comedy, songs with Hindi tunes). Since that time it has become one of the best known Sinhala movies and is considered as marking the birth of a uniquely Sri Lankan cinema. On 28 December 2006, the film was screened at Ceylon Theatre's Regal cinema at 5 pm to mark its premiere fifty years ago in the same theater on December 28, 1956. Synopsis The film starts with a tilt walker cum musician Miguel (Sesha Palihakkara) arriving in the village of Siriyalas with a monkey it performs various antics for the public. Two thieves of the village try to rob him and Sena (Somapala Dharapriya), a young boy prevents the robbery. The tilt walker, who is also a palm reader, read the boy's palm and predict the future, said that Sena will become a famous healer and bring dignity to the village. One day, when Sena and his friend Anula (Myrtle Fernando) were playing with a Kyte, Anula suddenly loses her eyesight. The native doctor of village was unable to restore Anula's sight but Sena touches her eyes, miraculously Anula begins to see. After that Sena got a reputation of a boy with a magical touch. Sena's father who is a notorious money lender of the village, used his talent to earn money. His father organize a healing campaign among the villagers. One day a rich land owner brought his son for the treatment, but after that boy died. The villagers are outraged say that it is Sena's fault. To make the situation worse the village undergoes a huge drought.

The conference building was being attacked with mortars on that date, as well, and again on 17 July 2007. The conference eventually opened for real on 19 July 2007; however, moderate Islamists and Hawiye clan elders still boycotted it, claiming that the venue were not neutral.

Newspaper feature coverage in 1909 called him \\"the world's greatest telegraph expert and inventor.\\" Biography He was born in King's County, Ireland (now Offaly). He came to the U.S. at the age of 10 and learned telegraphy in Hartford, Connecticut. Gradually he worked up from office boy to be superintendent of lines. In 1872 he and Thomas Edison worked together as engineers for the Automatic Telegraph Company. His first patent, related to telegraph relays, was granted in 1873. In 1877 Delaney left the industry entirely, to work as a newspaper correspondent, editor, and writer, until the discovery in 1880 that his patent could be used as an alternative technology to challenge the Western Union Telegraph Company's monopoly on telegraph relays. Delaney's later inventions included more than 150 patents registered in the U.S. through 1922. Almost all relate to telegraphy in some way: they cover anti-induction cables which were \\"extensively manufactured at Pittsburg, Penn\\" as of 1895, synchronous multiplex telegraphy to send six messages simultaneously over one wire, and rapid-machine telegraphy for land lines. His automatic telegraph system was capable of transmitting and recording 3000 words a minute over a single wire. In the 1890s he was experimenting at the Heart's Content Cable Station in Newfoundland and Labrador to improve the through-put of the transatlantic telegraph cable. Delany was awarded gold medals at the International Inventions Exhibition in London (1885), at the Pan-American Exposition (1901), and at the St. Louis Exposition (1904), and the John Scott Medal of the Franklin Institute. Delany was a two-time recipient of the Elliott Cresson Medal awarded by the Franklin Institute, one in 1886 for \\"Synchronous Telegraphy\\" and another in 1896 for \\"Telegraphy, High speed system\\". A copy of Delany's Telegraph Relay is in the permanent collection of the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institution. From 1893 to 1895 he was a vice president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

His many fans organised dinners on the occasion of his puzzles number 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000, with the 1968 dinner hosting nearly 400 solvers. His followers, known as Ximeneans, often sported a specially designed black tie covered in small white crosses. Well-known Ximeneans include Stephen Sondheim, P. G. Wodehouse, and Leonard Bernstein. Colin Dexter, author of the Inspector Morse books, named his most famous characters after two prize-winning Ximeneans, Sir Jeremy Morse and Mrs D. W. Lewis, and he named Morse's old Inspector Macnutt. In Rex Stout's Might as Well Be Dead (1956), detective Nero Wolfe is said to be working on a puzzle by Ximenes. In his 1966 book, Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword (reissued 2001), he laid down rules that he claimed should be present in all good crosswords.

They include using a symmetric grid, and the specification of maximum and minimum numbers of \\"unches\\" (unchecked letters i.e. ones that only appear in one word in the grid) for a given length of answer.

The screenplay was written by Ferrer and Al Morgan, Morgan's novel of the same name the source material. It was loosely based on the controversial career of Arthur Godfrey, a beloved TV and radio host whose image had been tarnished by a number of cast firings and Godfrey's contentious battles with the press. Plot Joe Harris (Jos√© Ferrer) is a popular, established local radio news reporter covering Broadway entertainment with a wise-guy attitude. Herb Fuller is the network's undisputed star. When Fuller dies in an auto accident, Philip Carleton (Dean Jagger), president of the Amalgamated Broadcasting Network, assigns Harris to prepare a memorial extravaganza, including an elaborate public viewing and a special memorial show featuring interviews with Fuller's radio cast, the \\"Fuller Family\\" (based on Arthur Godfrey's cast of \\"Little Godfreys\\"), and others who knew him. Carleton dangles a chance at Harris becoming Fuller's replacement if he succeeds. Assisted by network PR man Nick Cellentano (Jim Backus), Harris is intrigued by odd comments at the public viewing, including some from various individuals who attend strictly out of boredom and are indifferent to Fuller. Harris meets Sid Moore (Keenan Wynn), Fuller's longtime producer, who offers his assistance while realizing Harris is in line to become Fuller's successor. Aided by his secretary Ginny (Joanne Gilbert), Harris discovers Fuller was an alcoholic and an unethical womanizing egomaniac who became a star in spite of it. He is visited by Paul Beaseley (Ed Wynn), owner of a tiny Christian radio station in New England, who first hired Fuller, impressed by his inspirational poetry, and treated him as a son, only to discover Fuller's dark side. Harris is initially condescending to the mild-mannered Beaseley, but by the time he finishes his story, Harris is apologetic. Harris's investigations reveal Fuller's relationship with Carol Larson (Julie London), the alcoholic vocalist on his show, and various conflicts of interest involving his relationship with various song publishers whose songs were performed on Fuller's program. Fuller bandleader Eddie Brand (played by real-life bandleader Russ Morgan), hoping to remain on what he, too, suspects will become Harris's show, dutifully records an artificially sincere sound bite regarding Fuller. Moore signs Harris to a contract, then reveals more of Fuller's escapades. Carleton privately warns Harris of Moore's duplicitous nature, telling the newsman that the network will spin his chances of becoming Fuller's successor negatively so that Moore agrees to release him from the contract, adding that if Harris cannot secure a release, the network will turn elsewhere. Amassing the research into a script, Harris has to choose between praising the beloved, amusing and warm-hearted Fuller the public saw or unmasking the phony beneath the image. Harris makes up his mind as the broadcast starts, throwing away his prepared script to tell the truth about Herb Fuller. As Carleton and Moore listen in, Moore realizes what Harris is about to do. He rips up Harris's contract and demands that Carleton stop the broadcast. Seeing that Moore has done precisely what he had hoped for, Carleton refuses to stop the broadcast, explaining that he can market Harris as a man of principle and honesty to the public just as easily as his network marketed Fuller's phony image. Background While the movie was based on the controversy surrounding Arthur Godfrey, whose tabloid real- life persona contrasted with his warm-hearted public demeanor, the fictional Fuller's failings differed greatly. Godfrey's controversies were mostly public, not private. His early years in broadcasting in Baltimore, Washington DC and New York City were largely noncontroversial, marked mainly by favorable public reaction to his informality on the air and his extemporized, irreverent commercials. The term \\"the Fuller Family\\" used in the film was based on the umbrella term \\"Little Godfreys\\" applied to his cast. Godfrey's womanizing was long-rumored but never confirmed, and he was not a heavy drinker like Fuller. While Fuller was depicted as carrying blood to wounded soldiers overseas, a manufactured episode when he was too drunk to do his job, Godfrey remained stateside during World War II, doing his shows and carrying out his duties as a Naval Reserve officer around Washington. He subsequently earned the rank of Commander, in part because of his vocal support for the Navy (and the military) on his programs. Godfrey's reputation for bullying members of his cast offstage was one exception. That situation, originally private, only became public with the October 19, 1953 on air firing of singer, and popular Godfrey show discovery, Julius LaRosa. After a minor backstage dispute with Godfrey, LaRosa violated an unwritten rule against Godfrey show regulars hiring personal management, despite the fact their contracts contained no such prohibition.. Given Godfrey's popularity, the incident became a national scandal at the time, made worse when Godfrey explained the firing by declaring LaRosa had \\"lost his humility,\\" precipitating a public backlash against Godfrey himself. For a time, LaRosa saw his career flourish as daily negative press against his former employer grew, though his popularity eventually leveled off. Godfrey was also known to relish confrontations with CBS network executives, including network Chairman William S. Paley, criticizing them on the air, aware the high profits from commercial time on his three television and radio programs gave him the upper hand. Unlike Fuller, Godfrey did not die suddenly. He survived 1959 lung cancer surgery despite losing part of a lung and remained on CBS radio until 1972. He died in 1983 at age 79 of emphysema. At the time of the film's release, Godfrey was still highly controversial. Part of the controversy involved his subsequent firings of various \\"Little Godfreys.\\" 1955 accusations of anti-Semitism that grew out of Godfrey's part- ownership of a Miami Beach hotel notorious for refusing to accommodate Jews also dogged him, though few believed the charges. Godfrey insisted he had ended that policy when he became one of the owners.

In the film, a dance troupe from Ohio comes to New York to compete in a national talent competition. The 1987 Bollywood film Dance Dance and the 2003 Tamil film Boys were inspired by this film. Plot synopsis \\"The Adventurous Eight,\\" a multiracial talented group of singing and dancing teenagers from Sandusky, Ohio crave stardom so badly that they spend their spare time rehearsing their original songs and dance routines in an old building every day after school. The group consists of two boys and 6 girls: Matt, Michael, June, Debbie, Rita, Francine, Meryl and Valerie. A tacit promise of an audition from a well known dance executive leads the kids to New York, but on arrival at the company headquarters they are greeted by the news that the executive who had promised them an audition died. At first rebuffed when they claim to have met Mr. Sabol personally, they provide a business card from him, which leads them to a meeting with the current head of the company, Clem Friedkin. They then tell their story as to how Matt (John Scott Clough) and Michael (Don Franklin) met him by posing as waiters and obtained the card. However, they told their story for nothing since the show they arrived to perform in has been postponed for three weeks and he doubts they'd make it past the first round. After pressing him, he promises that if they are still in town when he returns in 3 and a half weeks he will give them 5 minutes to audition. When the boys return with the bad news, they all come together to agree to do whatever it takes to stay in town. After three days of cleaning the filthy apartment they can afford, they want to eat more than fast food. Matt comes up with a plan how they can eat steak that night: dancing for tips in a fancy restaurant. The number goes off well since they picked a hotel with a dental convention whose members think the entertainment was the manager's idea. As they sit around and eat, they discuss their success and what to do with their money. Over the next couple of weeks, the Adventurous Eight continue to raise money by passing out business cards while dancing in front of crowds in hopes of getting paying gigs. Which is what happens after being seen during one of their performances. When they go to famous dance club The Zoo, they run into a rival dance crew who is more street savvy and dances rings around them. Furious with what happened at the club, Michael demands they learn more current dance moves so they are never shown up again as well as being ready for the contest. Furthering their issues, the male tenants of the apartment building continue to refuse to keep their hands to themselves and one of the girls breaks a car window fighting them off. Two of their parents are called to get them out of jail. After some pleading, they allow their daughters to stay until the contest is over. Matt found himself tempted by Susan, the young woman who has hired the group to dance for a party she is tasked with coordinating since they are spending a lot of time together. After their performance at the party, she pulls Matt away from the rest of the group to pay him and is caught kissing him by her mother. He fails to wipe her lipstick off and after a heated argument girlfriend June decides to leave the group and return to Sandusky. The rest of the girls convince her to stay during a late night out drinking. Michael asks Matt if he thinks they are ready for the Shoot Out contest and they agree they are, but they have something to do first. They return to The Zoo and challenge the rival dance crew, this time coming out on top with fresh new dance moves. However when they return to see Friedkin, he refuses to give them the audition because Susan's mother made a call. They find Mrs. Sabol and convince her to assist them in getting into the contest (she calls Susan's mother for a reference and gives them a shot since they have never agreed on anything) after she seem them perform. Later, she goes to see Friedkin and discovers he has rigged the contest in favor of pre-selected entertainers who are guaranteed to make the company more than $250,000,000 over the next decade instead of staying true to the vision of her husband. After returning to the apartment, she convinces the group to take a chance with her and allow her to be their manager. The night of the contest, she disguises herself to get in and brings the group. She then contacts her people to get them and herself on stage (Friedkin barred her from the contest). Before going on stage, Matt tells June he's going to leave the group. She thinks he's not sincere and doing it for Susan, but Michael divulges that Susan married her boyfriend after using Matt to make him jealous. The group gets on stage and performs successfully and eventually to the cheers of an encore while Mrs. Sabol informs Friedkin that she is going to begin taking back control of her company.

He therefore introduced the idea of ‚Äúdynamic Structuralism,‚Äù with the concept of an ‚Äùopen system of systems,‚Äù to capture the aspects of variability and heterogeneity in time and place (Even- Zohar 1979). Using this new approach, he constructed a research program that dealt with literary systems rather than texts, which in the 1980s and early 1990s was considered a breakthrough in literary studies and laid the ground for new schools in literary and translation studies (e.g., the Tel Aviv School, the Leuven School). It allowed researchers to break away from the normative notion of ‚Äúliterature‚Äù and ‚Äúculture‚Äù as limited sets of highbrow products and explore a multi-layered interplay between ‚Äúcenter‚Äù and ‚Äúperiphery‚Äù, and ‚Äúcanonized‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-canonized.‚Äù Even-Zohar has also studied linguistic diglossia and the interrelationship of literary systems. =Polysystem theory= Even-Zohar substitutes univalent causal parameters with polyvalent factors as an instrument for explaining the complexity of culture within a single community and between communities. His \\"polysystem theory\\" (Even-Zohar 1978, 1979, 1990, 1997, 2005 [electronic book]) analyzed sets of relations in literature and language, but gradually shifted towards a more complex analysis of socio-cultural systems.2005 Polysystem Theory Revised Even-Zohar's polysystem theory has been embraced by students of literature and culture all over the world.Vasos comunicantes, page 22 (in Spanish) The theory has proven particularly relevant in Spain and China. (Iglesias 1999; Chung Wai Literary Monthly, Vol. 30, No. 3, August 2001). Another advocate of this theory is American scholar Edwin Gentzler.Polysystem Theory from Routledge Encyclopaedia of Translation Studies =The concept of ‚ÄòModels‚Äô= Even-Zohar took the basic idea of ‚Äòsystem‚Äô a step further in proposing that the object of study was no longer texts and products but rather dynamic cultural models that determine the production of concrete cultural objects (Even-Zohar 1997). Developing his theories in cognitive science and anthropology, he maintained that it is the inter-personal models which people acquire and employ in their day to day conduct as members of a community that help to explain the dynamics of a certain culture. The theory of models is part of Even-Zohar's larger Theory of Repertoire, both deeply inspired by Russian Formalism and the Soviet semiotics (Yuri Lotman, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Vladimir Toporov, Boris Uspensky, and others). =Translation studies= Even Zohar's analysis of norms in translation have shown that discrepancies between the source and the target texts can be explained as the result of actions governed by domestic norms. Even-Zohar's systemic approach has transformed Translation studies from a marginal philological specialty to a focus of inter-culture research. His article, ‚ÄúThe Position of Translated Literature‚Äù, is widely quoted.The position of translated literature withih the literary polysistem His polysystem theory has opened many avenues to researchers in translation studies. (Susan Bassnett, 1993: 142). In Even-Zohar's terms, a ‚Äòpolysystem‚Äô is multidimensional and able to accommodate taxonomies established in the realm of literature (the division between high and low literature), translation (the division between translation and non translation) and social relationships (the division between dominant and dominated social groups). (Lianeri 2001). =Nation-building through culture= Even-Zohar has studied the role of literature in the construction of national cultures and published comparative analyses of Hebrew, Italian, Norwegian, Galician, Catalan and Icelandic culture. Even-Zohar has proposed that ‚Äòculture‚Äô as an object of study should no longer be restricted to products, but include models for cultural actions. Culture is thus perceived as a life-management program, not just a set of elite commodities (Even-Zohar 1997, 2005). Even-Zohar's analysis of the emergence and crystallization of native Hebrew culture in Palestine is widely cited and used as a model for paradigmatic analysis of other emerging cultures. Since the 1990s, Even- Zohar's research has focused on deliberate culture planning in the development of new socio-political entities. He has examined problems of majority and minority, and center and periphery in the context of accessing and controlling resources. Since the end of the 18th century a growing number of communities around the globe have adopted the model of self-management, often bundled together with enterprises to create separate culture repertoires. Even-Zohar began with the building of Hebrew culture in Palestine between 1882 and 1948, and then moved on to other societies. Since 1993, he has been carrying out research in situ in Spanish Galicia, Catalonia, Iceland, Qu√©bec, and Newfoundland.

Biography Barnes was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. After playing college baseball at his hometown University of Cincinnati, Barnes was selected by the Reds in the 16th round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft. Barnes worked his way through the minors, earning promotion to the Reds in 1983 after hitting .337 for the Reds' Indianapolis farm club. Although Barnes continued to have great success at the Triple-A level for many years, he was unable to find a home in the majors. Between 1984 and 1990, he played in just 60 big- league games, including four for the 1987 National League champion St. Louis Cardinals. In four of those years, he hit .300 or better in the minors. Barnes finally achieved stable big-league status at the age of 34, when most players have long retired. After hammering International League pitching at a .330 clip through the first two months of the 1991 season, Barnes was called up by the Tigers. A capable fielder at several positions and a good contact hitter, he turned out to be a good fit for the Tigers, which had defensive problems and a lineup that struck out a lot. Barnes spent most of the next three seasons with the Tigers. Detroit fans appreciated his blue-collar work ethic; he was sometimes called \\"Crash Davis\\" after the fictional character in the film Bull Durham, who had spent most of his career in the minor leagues. During all or part of nine seasons in the majors, Barnes played in 353 games with 614 at-bats, 95 runs, 159 hits, 30 doubles, four triples, 14 home runs, 83 RBIs, 20 stolen bases, 41 walks, .259 batting average, .306 on-base percentage, .389 slugging percentage, 239 total bases, eight sacrifice hits, eight sacrifice flies, and three intentional walks. In the minor leagues, Barnes batted .296 for his career and had 1,773 career hits. At the time, he ranked as one of the all-time leading hitters in the minor leagues. He retired as a player following the 1994 season, and was active in the game as a minor- league coach and manager. Barnes' post-playing jobs have included a stint as manager of the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays of the Midwest League in 2006, two coaching stints in the Midwest League (1997‚Äì98 and 2005), coaching in the Southern League in 2003‚Äì04, in the International League (1995‚Äì96, 1999), and managing the Lakeland Tigers in 2000. From 2007 to present, Barnes served as the Tampa Bay Rays minor-league outfield and base-running coordinator.

Butt welding can also be done with brazing for copper pieces. It is used to attach two pieces of metal together such as pipe, framework in factories, and also flanges. A flange is something that either is internal or external that provided to strengthen a piece of material. In factories butt welding has shown how economical it can be for companies to use when building things out of metal. This is because if they wanted to make something out of metal without welding it together they would have to bend everything and reinforce the structure which costs more than welding the two pieces together. Butt welding is accomplished by heating up two pieces of metal, or applying pressure, or doing both of those. Penetration while welding the metal is important to maintain and with thin pieces of metal this is possible however, with thick pieces edge preparation may have to be done to prepare the metal. Full penetration butt welds are made when they are in the within the parent(bigger, stronger) metal. In butt welding the strongest welds will have the fewest imperfections. To achieve this the heat input is controlled, which decreases the size of the weld. In commercial welding when this is done it also reduces cost but in order to maintain the strength of the weld double butt welds will be used. In butt welding there are two types used to achieve the specific welds and then there are also a variety of joints considered to be butt joints. Butt welding is best performed with MIG or TIG welding applications due to their natural ability to connect two pieces of metal together. Using different types of welding electrodes for the welder will determine the properties of the weld such as its resistance against corrosion and strength. Electrodes conduct current through the metal being welded in order join the two pieces. The metal determines the type of welding that is required. The electrodes are either heavily or lightly coated. For the heavily coated electrodes are commonly used in structural welding because they are much stronger and corrosion resistant. The lightly coated electrodes are not as structurally sound. Butt welding is performed with the Arc, TIG, or MIG welder held at a slight angle the weld if the weld is laying flat in order to achieve the least amount of porosity in the weld and also to increase the weld's strength. Fillet welding make up about 80 percent of the connection despite being weaker that butt welds. The reason it is used more often is because fillet welds offer more room for error with much larger tolerances. Fillet welding is not a type of butt weld despite its similarities.  Types of butt welding  = Flash = Flash butt welding is used with machinery and connects multiple pieces of metal together that are miss matched in size and shape. These different sizings can oftentimes cause for breaks in welding process. High voltage current is applied in order to connect the metal pieces together by applying it to both the components known as flashing in order to join them together. = Resistance = Electric welding of wire before wire drawing at the 'Barzelit' wire drawing and nail factory in Mandatory Palestine This weld joins the two pieces of metal together by heat that comes from the pressure due to the metals being held together at a preset force. Resistance butt welding is used on joints that are of similar shape and size and often the weld is performed in one movement unlike flash welding.  Types of butt joints  Single-V Butt Weld There are many different types of butt welding joints and they all are named with their particular shape. The joint also known as a square groove weld has many different forms in order to connect pieces of metal together and are all capable of bearing loads. There are many different types of joints such as lap joints, tee joints, butt joints, and also corner joints. Lap joints are two pieces that are end-over-end and welded together whereas butt welds are put end to end and connected that way. Butt welds are connected to each other with the thickness of the parent metal. There are many different kinds of butt welds such as square, single v, double v, single bevel, double bevel, single u, double u, single j, and also a double j. Minimizing the distortions in a weld is important however doing so will minimize the chances of full penetration. In order to get full penetration double welds such as double v, double j, and double u may be used. Standards EN 1993-1-8, which covers the design of joints in the design of steel structures, defines a set of provisions for welding structural steel. See also * Fillet weld - a weld of approximately triangular cross section joining two surfaces at approximately right angles to each other * Plug weld * Flare groove weld * Weld access hole * Welding joint - a joining process that produces a coalescence of metals (or non metals) by heating them to the welding temperature, with or without the application of pressure, or by pressure alone, and with or without the use of filler metals References Category:Welding ","title":"Butt welding"},{"id":"9833401","text":"The War of 1812 museum is a museum in Plattsburgh, New York dedicated to exploring the causes and effects of the War of 1812 and the Battle of Plattsburgh.

It owns heritage railway locomotives, rolling stock, and structures in the Wanganui area. It also operates occasional excursions in conjunction with other societies and provides a base for excursions passing through Wanganui to stop and visit while replenishing supplies. Its goal is to establish a railway precinct in Wanganui as a historical and tourist attraction.  Society history and infrastructure  The society was formed around 1990 with the express goal of restoring the old Wanganui turntable, which was then facing scrap. SteamRail Wanganui successfully saved the turntable and restored it over a period of three years with the assistance of Steam Incorporated. The first locomotive to use it was Steam Incorporated's KA 945 and the turntable now sees daily use by regular trains, as well as occasional use by visiting excursions.SteamRail Wanganui - About Us The society subsequently acquired other railway infrastructure in the Wanganui area, including the Aramoho signal box, East Town Workshops staff buildings, and a shed converted into a storage depot for the society's rolling stock.SteamRail Wanganui - Buildings  Locomotives  The organisation possesses three small diesel locomotives, all of which were used in private industrial service rather than by the New Zealand Railways Department.

Nurul Amin, as a leader of Pakistan Democratic Party, led the formation of the Shanti Committee to thwart the Mukti Bahini who fought for the independence of Bangladesh. Background On 25 March 1971, the liberation war began. On 4 April 1971, twelve pro- Pakistan leaders, including Nurul Amin, Ghulam Azam and Khwaja Khairuddin, met General Tikka Khan of the Pakistan Army and assured him of co-operation in opposing the Bangladesh rebellion. After subsequent meetings, they announced the formation of the Citizen Peace Committee, with 140 members. The first recruits included 96 Jamaat-e-Islami members, who started training in an Ansar camp at Khanjahan Ali Road, Khulna. The Shanti Committee is also alleged to have recruited Razakars.The Wall Street Journal, 27 July 1971; quoted in the book Muldhara 71 by Moidul Hasan History The leaders of the East Pakistan Central Peace Committee called on citizens of Pakistan to defend Pakistan from \\"Indian aggression\\", as India was supporting the Bangladesh liberation movement. The Peace Committee organised a rally from Baitul Mukarram to Chawkbazar Mosque on 13 April. The rally was to end with a meeting near New Market. At the end of the rally, participants began rioting in Azimpur, Shantinagar and Shankhari Bazar areas. They set fire to the houses of known pro-liberation people and killed some. The Peace Committee spread throughout East Pakistan, reaching even rural villages. Compared to the indiscriminate killing of Pakistan army the Peace committee were more specific and guided by lists they made of opponents. The Peace committee members were feared by the population of East Pakistan. Peace committee members were killed during Bangladesh Liberation War. On 14 April, at a meeting in Dhaka, the Citizen Peace Committee renamed itself as the East Pakistan Central Peace Committee. A working committee was formed consisting of 21 members. They set up an office in Maghbazar. The Peace Committee appointed one or more liaison officers for the different police station areas of Dhaka. On 17 April 1971, the members of the peace committee apprised Governor Tikka Khan of the progress made by them toward restoring normalcy and confidence among the citizens. The central peace committee was being deputed to the district and divisional headquarters throughout east Pakistan. The peace committee in Munshiganj gave a grand reception to the West Pakistani militaries on 11 May 1971. According to the historian Azadur Rahman Chandan in his 2011 book about the war, the Peace Committee was the first organisation to be set up by local residents who collaborated with Pakistan. Its members were drawn from the political parties of the Muslim League and Jamaat-e-Islami, which thought an independent Bangladesh was against Islam; as well as the Urdu-speaking Biharis. Abolition On 16 December 1971, after the end of the war, the Committee was abolished.

The film premiered at the 45th Venice International Film Festival, in which Isabelle Huppert was awarded the prize for best actress. It has been cited as a favorite by filmmaker John Waters, who presented it as his annual selection within the 2008 Maryland Film Festival. Plot Under the German military administration in occupied France during World War II. Paul Latour is a prisoner of war in Germany and his wife Marie lives hand-to-mouth with their two children in a squalid flat. A neighbour, whose husband is also in Germany, has fallen pregnant and is trying to lose the baby. Marie helps her, successfully. Other women come to her and she starts charging. While talking with Paul, following his release, she reveals that a fortune teller saw \\"nothing but good things\\" in her future, along with a lot of women, which she wouldn't clarify. Marie confesses to wanting to be a famous singer. She has, however, lost her love for her husband, who has been wounded and struggles to stay in employment, and rejects his crude and abrupt sexual demands. Although he cannot find work, he rents a bigger flat at her prompting. Marie continues her illicit business and lets prostitutes use their bedrooms during the day. When one of the abortions goes wrong, the woman dies and her despairing husband commits suicide. Marie shrugs off the tragedy and hires a maid to help. She visits a music teacher, who tells her that she has a great voice. She also starts a daytime affair with a collaborator and offers the maid a pay raise if she sleeps with Paul. Paul is unhappy with this arrangement and, after he returns home early and witnesses Marie and her lover asleep together, he sends an anonymous denunciation to the police, alerting them to her illegal activities. A recent law of the Vichy r√©gime, determined to enforce morality and stop population decline, has made abortion a treasonable crime. Marie is condemned to death and guillotined.

As the name suggests, this receptor binds the chemokine CX3CL1 (also called neurotactin or fractalkine).  Function  The fractalkine ligand CX3CL1 is a transmembrane protein and chemokine involved in the adhesion and migration of leukocytes. The protein encoded by the CX3CR1 gene is a receptor for the fractalkine ligand. Expression of this receptor appears to be associated with lymphocytes. CX3CR1 is also expressed by monocytes and plays a major role in the survival of monocytes. Fractalkine signaling has also recently been discovered to play a developmental role in the migration of microglia in the central nervous system to their synaptic targets, where phagocytosis and synaptic refinement occur. CX3CR1 knockout mice had more synapses on hippocampal neurons than wild-type mice.  Clinical significance  CX3CR1 also is a coreceptor for HIV-1, and some variations in this gene lead to increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and rapid progression to AIDS. CX3CR1 variants have been described to modify the survival time and the progression rate of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mutations in CX3CR1 are associated to dysplasia of the hip. Homozygous CX3CR1-M280 mutation impairs human monocyte survival and deteriorates outcome of human systemic candiasis.

XCR1 is also known as GPR5.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a chemokine receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The family members are characterized by the presence of 7 transmembrane domains and numerous conserved amino acids. This receptor is most closely related to RBS11 and the MIP1-alpha/RANTES receptor. It transduces a signal by increasing the intracellular calcium ions level. The viral macrophage inflammatory protein-II is an antagonist of this receptor and blocks signaling. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. Cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) in the spleen develop into XCR1+ DCs in the small intestine, T cell zones of Peyer's patches, and T cell zones and sinuses of mesenteric lymph nodes. XCR1+ DCs specialize in cross- presentations of orally applied antigens. The integrin SIRPŒ± is also a differentiating factor for the XCR1+ DCs. The development transcription factor Batf3 helps develop the differences between XCR1+ DCs and CD103+ CD11b- DCs. XCL1 contributes to chemotaxis only in CD8+ murine cells, but not other DC types, B cells, T cells, or NK cells. Only some of these CD8+ murine cells expressed XCR1 receptors. NK cells release XCL1 along with IFN-Œ≥ and some other chemokines upon encountering certain bacteria such as Listeria or MCMV. XCR1+ and CD8+cells work together to cross-present antigen and communicate CD8+ activation. Cross presentation of XCR1+ CD8+ and XCR1+ CD8- cells was strongest, as is expected since they have XCR1 receptors. CD4+ and CD8+ may become outdated terms, since the activity of the cell appears to be primarily dependent upon the expression of XCR1, which will make a population far more similar than the expression of CD4 or CD8. XCR1+ cells are dependent on the growth factor Ftl3 ligand and are nonexistent in Batf3- deficient mice. Also, XCR1+ DCs are related to CD103+CD11b- DCs. XCL1 is expressed by medullary thymic epithelial T cells (mTECs) while XCR1 is expressed by thymic dendritic cells (tDCs). This communication helps with the destruction of cells that are not self-tolerant. When mice lose the ability to express XCL1, they are deficient in accumulation of tDCs and producing naturally occurring regulatory T cells (nT reg cells). The displaying of XCL1 by mTECs, tDC chemotaxis, and nT reg cell production are all decreased in mice that lack Aire, demonstrating it as an important regulator of XCL1 production. Naive CD8+ T cells are prepared when tumors form by cross-presentation via XCR1+ DCs and as a result will require a lower threshold to respond to antigen. Memory CD8+ T lymphocytes (mCTLs) are activated first after infection and then are signaled by CXCR3, IL-12, and CXCL9 by other XCR1+ DCs. In order to make a powerful secondary infection response, cytokine and chemokine signaling between XCR1+ DCs and NK cells must occur.

Fragments of his reign can be traced via Frankish sources. Assistance to Widukind King Sigfred is first mentioned in 777 when the Saxon chief Widukind, leader of the resistance against Charlemagne, fled Saxony in the face of the Frankish onslaught. Widukind found refuge with Sigfred, but the Frankish annals do not say in detail what kind of assistance the Danish king may have provided. At any rate, Charlemagne made no attempt to subordinate or threaten the Danes during his Saxon campaigns.Einhards Jahrb√ºcher, Anno 777 , p. 64. German chronicles, to better espouse the family tree of Widukind‚Äôs heirs, stated that he was married to Sigfred's daughter Geva.D. Schwennicke (1984), Europ√§ische Stammtafeln, Vol. II. Marburg. Tafel 104. Frankish diplomacy In the summer of 782, Charlemagne led his armed forces to the sources of the Lippe River, staying there for some time. On this occasion he received envoys from Sigfred, although the details of the negotiations are not disclosed. Shortly after, Widukind left his Nordic refuge and returned to Saxony where he successfully egged the population to rebel against the Frankish king.Einhards Jahrb√ºcher, Anno 782 , p.69. He then led the Saxon resistance until 785 when he finally submitted to Charlemagne. For several years there is no mention of the Danish king, but in 798 Charlemagne sent one of his trustees, Godeskalk, on a diplomatic mission to Sigfred. On his return, Godeskalk was slain by the rebellious Saxons living to the north- east of the Elbe. When the Franks put down the rebellion they were helped by the prince of the Obotrites, Drozko, who would later on be dealt with by Sigfred's successor Gudfred.Einhards Jahrb√ºcher, Anno 798 , p. 95. Poems by the Lombard literati Peter of Pisa and Paulus Diaconis convey a very negative image of Sigfred. Peter wrote that Charlemagne had let him choose between being fettered, imprisoned, or sent to convert Sigfred. In a poetic reply, Paulus castigated the Danish king as a wild beast who ruled over other wild animals; an uncouth pagan who would nevertheless be unable to stand up against the mighty Frankish ruler. If he dared molest Peter and his entourage and refuse Christianisation, he would quickly be led before Charlemagne's throne in fetters, abandoned by Odin (Waten) and Thor (Thonar).Johannes Steenstrup (1881), \\"Nogle Efterretningar fra udenlandske Kilder om Danmark i Oldtiden\\", Historisk Tidskrift, p. 231 It is interesting that the characterization is similar to that accorded to Ongendus, one of Sigfred's predecessors in the early 8th century.H. Hellmuth Andersen (1985), \\"Vandt sig hele Danmark\\", Skalk, p. 22; Dan Hemming (1979), Guldhornens tale. Copenhagen, p. 178; Alcuin, Das Leben des heil. Willibrord , p. 14. The poems also indicate that the Danes had started to draw some attention from the Carolingian elite by this time. The reign of Sigfred had ended by 804 when another ruler, Gudfred, is mentioned in the Frankish annals. Place in early Danish history Nothing is known about Sigfred's relationship to Gudfred, who succeeded him as king of Denmark c. 804‚Äì810, or later kings such as Hemming (810‚Äì812), Harald 'Klak' Halfdansson (812-813, 819‚Äì827) and Horik I (813‚Äì854). Since the name Sigfred was borne by a nephew of Gudfred, he is often taken to have been the father of Gudfred, since children were often named after their grandfathers.Einhards Jahrb√ºcher, Anno 812 , p. 123. The approximate dates of Sigfred's reign, and references to a King Harald who may have been either a predecessor, co-ruler or immediate successor of Sigfred, has led to speculations about a link with the legendary Swedish and Danish ruler Sigurd Hring.For this Harald, see Einhards Jahrb√ºcher, Anno 812 , p. 123. According to the sagas, Sigurd Hring defeated the Danish ruler Harald Wartooth at the Battle of Br√°vellir 2-3 generations before the first Danish conquest of England but the historicity of Hring, Wartooth and the battle are uncertain. According to the Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok saga, Sigurd Hring was the father of the legendary Viking leader Ragnar Lodbrok. Modern scholarship is in agreement that part of the genealogy of the early Viking Age kings of Denmark is of High medieval era documentation.Alfred P. Smyth (1977), Scandinavian kings in the British Isles 850-880. Oxford. It has been theorized that Sigfred's father was Ongendus, or Angantyr, which is problematic because there is more than half a century between them. The two kings may nevertheless have been related since a Danish prince Angantyr is known to have flourished in 811, and the name is extremely unusual.Einhards Jahrb√ºcher, Anno 811 , p. 121. The recurrence of the names Angantyr, Sigfred, Harald and Gudfred throughout the 8th and 9th centuries suggests that the kings of the early Viking Age were mutually related.

They represent one subfamily of chemokine receptors, a large family of G protein-linked receptors that are known as seven transmembrane (7-TM) proteins, since they span the cell membrane seven times. There are currently seven known CXC chemokine receptors in mammals, named CXCR1 through CXCR7. CXCR1 and CXCR2 CXCR1 and CXCR2 are closely related receptors that recognize CXC chemokines that possess an E-L-R amino acid motif immediately adjacent to their CXC motif. CXCL8 (otherwise known as interleukin-8) and CXCL6 can both bind CXCR1 in humans, while all other ELR-positive chemokines, such as CXCL1 to CXCL7 bind only CXCR2. They are both expressed on the surface of neutrophils in mammals. CXCR3 CXCR3 is expressed predominantly on T cells (T lymphocytes), and also on other lymphocytes [some B cells (B lymphocytes) and NK cells] and is highly induced following cell activation. There are two isoforms, CXCR3-A and CXCR3-B. It has three highly related ligands in mammals, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11. CXCR4 CXCR4 (also known as fusin) is the receptor for a chemokine known as CXCL12 (or SDF-1) and, as with CCR5, is utilized by HIV-1 to gain entry into target cells. This receptor has a wide cellular distribution, with expression on most immature and mature hematopoietic cell types (e.g. neutrophils, monocytes, T and B cells, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells and macrophages). In addition, CXCR4 can also be found on vascular endothelial cells and neuronal/nerve cells. CXCR5 The chemokine receptor CXCR5 is expressed on B cells and CD4+ Tfh cells and is involved in lymphocyte homing and the development of normal lymphoid tissue. Its principal ligand is CXCL13 (or BLC). CXCR6 CXCR6 was formerly called three different names (STRL33, BONZO, and TYMSTR) before being assigned CXCR6 based on its chromosomal location (within the chemokine receptor cluster on human chromosome 3p21) and its similarity to other chemokine receptors in its gene sequence. CXCR6 binds the ligand CXCL16. However, CXCR6 is more closely related in structure to CC chemokine receptors than to other CXC chemokine receptors. CXCR7 CXCR7 was originally called RDC-1 (an orphan receptor) but has since been shown to cause chemotaxis in T lymphocytes in response to CXCL12 (the ligand for CXCR4) prompting the renaming of this molecule as CXCR7. CXCR7 was recently renamed ACKR3. There is no information publicly available to confirm whether this designation has been accepted by the IUIS/WHO Subcommittee on Chemokine Nomenclature at this time. This receptor has also been identified on memory B cells.

As the glaciers retreated, moose (which had crossed the Bering land bridge from Asia) may have populated the habitat of Cervalces scotti and caused its extinction by competition. Although there is no paleontological evidence that it was associated with humans, other theories for its extinction have been proposed. Notably, there is speculation that hunting by newly arrived humans caused the extinction of the Cervalces scotti and other large mammals. Additionally, some have proposed a sudden extinction by disease, brought by small mammals in association with humans. The oldest known fossil of Cervalces scotti was found in the bed of the Skunk River in Iowa, with the specimen dating back approximately 30,000 years ago. The area in which the fossil was found and the date implies that Cervalces scotti lived before a massive ice sheet covered the area in which it inhabited, which could also be a possible cause of its extinction. Since the stag-moose resides in a woodland habitat, climate change and loss of natural pastures also could have played a role in its extinction.Strauss, Bob. \\"Stag Moose (Cervalces Scotti)\\".

Remains of Cervalces scotti found in modern-day Ohio have suggested that it and Homo sapiens could have possibly interacted. Fossils of both Cervalces scotti and other large extinct mammals in the area suggest that it have been a frequent target of early human hunters.Mayhood, Kevin. \\"Solving a 10,000-year-old mystery - Researchers study clues to figure out what killed giant ice age moose.\\" Columbus Dispatch, The (OH) 16 Sep. 2008, Home Final, News - Science: 04B. NewsBank. Web. 23 Oct. 2014. Remains of the stag moose, along with Paleo Indian artifacts and the remains of the flat-headed peccary, giant short-faced bear, and the giant beaver were found in the Sheriden Cave in Wyandot County, Ohio. Palaeobiology Cervalces scotti, like several other members of its genus, probably lived in marshes and bogs, as well as spruce-taiga floral communities. There were also surroundings ranging from tundra‚Äìmixed coniferous forests to deciduous woodlands. These sedges and willows may have not have been suitable food products, but they provide an imagery of the ecology of the stag-moose. The change in flora and fauna due to complete deglaciation probably also affected the living conditions of the stag-moose in states like Iowa and Wisconsin, where the stag-moose was found at more than 20 sites. None of these sites, however, has any evidence that the stag-moose interacted with humans, furthering evidence that the extinction of the stag-moose is not comparable to that of large herbivores that were greatly affected by hunting. The stag moose reproduced more often than megaherbivores, and so the hypothesis is that the stag-moose's disappearance is linked to the emergence of the \\"true moose\\" (Alces alces), instead.Levy, Sharon. \\"Clashing with Titans.\\" BioScience 56.4 (2006): 292.

Her lobbying on behalf of female athletes forced the inclusion of women's events in the Olympic Games. Milliat, a translator by profession participated in the sport of rowing. She was also an avid swimmer and hockey player. A member of Femina Sport, a club founded in 1911, she helped form the Federation Francaise Sportive Feminine in 1917, becoming treasurer and later president. In 1921 she organized the first international women's sporting event in Monte Carlo (follow-ups in 1922 and 1923). She is credited with igniting the pressure on the Olympic Games to allow more female representation in a broader range of sports, a process that is still ongoing today. Her name is engraved on the pediment of a gymnasium in the 14th arrondissement in Paris, thanks to her contributions to athletics. Formation of the FSFI Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a prominent Frenchman, is credited with reviving the Olympic Games and founding the IOC (International Olympics Committee) in 1894. 1900 was the first Olympics to allow women athletes, but only in the sports of golf and tennis. Eventually, the Olympics integrated women's swimming and other events into the games. However, track and field events for women remained conspicuously absent from the Olympics In 1919, Milliat asked the IAAF to include women's track and field athletics events in the 1924 Olympic Games. They refused. On 31 October 1921, Milliat formed La F√©d√©ration Sportive F√©minine Internationale (FSFI) to oversee international women's sporting events. The FSFI decided to hold a Women's Olympic Games, which would include all sports, rather than the restricted number allowed to women in the official Olympics helmed by Pierre de Coubertin.gbrathletics ‚Äì Women's World Games Women's World Games The first informal iteration of the games occurred in 1921 Monte Carlo, and due to the lack of a running track, took place on a pigeon shooting field. In 1922, the experiment was revived, again in Monte Carlo. This time, 300 athletes competed, representing 7 nations In August 1922, the first Women's Olympics were conducted in Pershing Stadium in Paris and featured five teams including the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia as well as the host country France. Eleven athletics events were conducted and the 20,000 strong crowd saw eighteen athletes break world records. Infuriated by the use of the term 'Olympic Games' the IOC convinced Milliat and the FSFI to change the name of their event in exchange for adding 10 women's events to the 1928 Olympics. Baron Pierre De Coubertin, widely known as the man to reintroduce the Olympic Games to the modern world, was among the most vocal opponents to women's participation in the games As such, the next edition of the event, held in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1926, was termed the Women's World Games. Ten teams took part in this edition of the Games. The Olympic Games and de Coubertin, due to pressure from the FSFI, eventually integrated five women's track and field events into the Olympics in 1928. However, to Milliat, this was not enough, since men were allowed to compete in 22 events. The British women's team boycotted the Amsterdam games for the same reason. Two further Games were held in Prague in 1930 (featuring other sports in addition to athletics) and in London in 1934. After these games, Milliat issued an ultimatum: fully integrate the 1936 Olympics, or cede all women's participation to the FSFI. This led the IAAF to appoint a special commission to cooperate with the FSFI, which ceded control of international women's athletics to the IAAF in exchange for an expanded program and a recognition of records set in the Women's Games. To this day, the Olympics does not offer an equal slate of men's and women's sports. However, Milliat's pressure greatly expanded women's representation at the Olympics. In a 1934 interview, Milliat said: \\"Women's sports of all kinds are handicapped in my country by the lack of playing space. As we have no vote, we can not make our needs publicly felt, or bring pressure to bear in the right quarters. I always tell my girls that the vote is one of the things they will have to work for if France is to keep its place with the other nations in the realm of feminine sport.\\"  Personal life  After working in Nantes as a primary school teacher, Milliat went to England. Here she married a compatriot, Joseph Milliat. They had no children, and he died in 1908. After his death, she travelled widely, developing language skills that enabled her to become a translator when, following the outbreak of the First World War, she returned to France. Football (Soccer) In 1920 Milliat assembled a football (Soccer) team of women from Paris that toured the UK and played the Dick, Kerr's Ladies on behalf of France in the world first internationally recognised Women's Football tournament.  Women's Suffrage in France  In 1934 Milliat spoke to an interviewer from the Women's Magazine \\"Independent Woman.\\" In her statement, she advocated for women's suffrage in France. She believed women's suffrage would lead to greater support for women's sports.

McIntyre, published in 1997. The book combines two major genres: science fiction (specifically the alternate history subgenre) and historical romance. It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1997, beating out A Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin. The novel was inspired by the short story (written in the form of a faux-encyclopedia article) \\"The Natural History and Extinction of the People of the Sea\\", also by McIntyre, which was illustrated by fellow author Ursula K. Le Guin.  Plot summary  Set in 17th-century France at the court of the Sun King, King Louis XIV, the young, colony-raised, na√Øve Mademoiselle Marie-Jos√®phe de la Croix is the lady-in-waiting to King Louis XIV's niece. Her brother, Father Yves de la Croix (a natural philosopher and explorer), has recently returned from a mission commissioned by the king: to bring back the endangered sea monster whose flesh is rumoured to give the consumer immortality. Father Yves brings back two specimens: one, a dead male sea monster covered in sawdust and ice; the other, a live female sea monster placed in the Apollo fountain in the Palace of Versailles. Acting as her brother's assistant, sketching the dead sea monster's dissection, and caring for the live specimen, Marie-Jos√®phe soon realizes the creature is not a sea monster, but a sea woman. Thus, Marie-Jos√®phe tries to convince the others at court, including her brother, that the sea woman is intelligent and hopefully free her. Unfortunately, only Marie-Jos√®phe can understand the sea woman (now called Sherzad) and her musical way of talking. As a result, the court (especially the men) ignore her. They bleed her for hysteria, the pope openly shows outrage over the impropriety of her composing a cantata, and several court men harass her on the King's hunt. At the same time, her slave Odelette (really called Haleed) struggles to gain her freedom. Only the stoic Count Lucien believes Marie-Jos√®phe about the sea woman, calmly taking the sea woman and Marie-Jos√®phe's scientific endeavors in stride. In order to save her own life, Sherzad, the sea monster, offers the king the location of a sunken treasure ship in return for her freedom. But despite the discovery of Spanish gold found from the wreck, the king intends to keep Sherzad and eat her, the lure of immortality being too strong. Marie-Jos√®phe and Count Lucien (who she has fallen in love with) plot secretly to release Sherzad, defying the pope, their king and her brother. Their attempt fails, but Yves (finally realizing Sherzad's sentience and its repercussions on his actions) aid them in finally releasing Sherzad. In the end, Marie-Jos√®phe and Count Lucien are exiled, but Sherzad, who had declared vengeance on all humanity, showers them with forgotten sunken treasures in gratitude.  Main character profiles  * Marie-Jos√®phe de la Croix - Lady-in-waiting to King Louis XIV's niece and the younger sister of Father Yves de la Croix. She is an amateur composer and lover of mathematics who was Convent-raised and, at first, na√Øve. As assistant to her brother in his scientific endeavors (mainly as a sketcher of specimens), she also shares her brother's interests in natural philosophy. She befriends the sea monster, later called Sherzad, and being the only one able to understand the sea monster, becomes her translator. *Father Yves de la Croix - Marie-Jos√®phe's older brother. A Jesuit priest and King Louis's natural philosopher, he recently returned from an expedition commissioned by the King to find the legendary sea monster ‚Äì the possible key to immortality. He is stuck between his religious obligations, his scientific endeavors, and his own pride. Yves is later revealed to be a bastard son of King Louis. *Count Lucien de Chretien - A dwarf who is an open Atheist and King's Louis‚Äô most trusted advisor. The epitome of etiquette, he is Marie-Jos√®phe's love interest. He is stuck between his kindling feelings for Marie-Jos√®phe and his duty to his beloved King. *Sherzad (the sea creature/sea woman) - One of the last sea monsters in the world, she is captured by Father Yves de la Croix and caged in the Apollo fountain in the Versailles for King Louis XIV. Her flesh is rumored to make the eater immortal. Her saliva is able to heal wounds, though this fact is not realized by the other characters. She has two tails, tangled hair, and a gargoyle face, as well as an enchanting voice, the music of which is her way of communicating. However, she can only communicate with Marie-Jos√®phe.

London brought the project to Jim Henson Pictures, who said he was drawn to \\"the weird juxtaposition (of) a completely imagined creature in this very specific historical world.\\" The film was set to be directed by Christopher Renshaw, which would've been his feature film debut, and written by Laura Harrington with McIntyre's involvement. Stephanie Allain and Kristine Belson would executive producer from Jim Henson Pictures. Film producer Bill Mechanic later joined production and brought the film to Walt Disney Pictures after signing a five-year deal with the company in December 2001. Mechanic planned for the film to start pre-production in early 2002, with Natalie Portman to star and James Schamus to revise the script, with Gregory Hoblit to possibly direct. Following Sony breaking from the joint venture of Jim Henson Pictures in 1999, the film would be produced by The Jim Henson Company instead. In August 2013, it was announced that Sean McNamara would direct the film, and that casting included Pierce Brosnan as King Louis XIV, Fan Bingbing as the mermaid, and Bill Nighy as Pere de Chaise, a character created for the movie. Nighy pulled out of the film due to a scheduling conflict and was replaced by William Hurt weeks before filming. The film began production on April 23, 2014 at Victoria, Australia along with Docklands Studios Melbourne. Additional filming also took place in Versailles, France. Mechanic had also revised the script with Barry Berman and Ronald Bass. Chinese film company Kylin Films invested $20.5 million into the movie, making it China's biggest financial contribution to a non-studio film produced outside China. Paramount Pictures acquired US distribution rights and set the movie for wide release on April 10, 2015, with international sales being handled by Good Universe. However, three weeks before the film's release, the film was pulled from its schedule. A source close to the film claimed that the film needed more time to complete the special effects work.

Prior to the 1923 elections, Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, Prime Minister and leader of the Radical Party, met with the leaders of in Skopje and bargained for their support in exchange for their participation in his government, which became necessary for his party as it after the elections without D≈æemijet and ethnic German party, no government could be formed. Pa≈°iƒá agreed to legalize Albanian-language schooling, while 1924 D≈æemijet requested the cancellation of the colonization programmes of Kosovo. As no requirements were met by Pa≈°iƒá, D≈æemijet voted against the proposed budget by the Radical Party in 1924. The opposition of the budget marked the breakdown of relations between the parties and D≈æemijet's eventual suppression and illegalization. Ferhat Draga, the new leader of the party, decided that the community's interests would be best represented through the formation of a wider anti-Belgrade opposition front with the Croatian Peasant Party, whose congress he attended in October 1924 for that purpose. However, his views weren't supported by a minority group that sought continuation of a policy of unconditional compromise with the radical party. In the meantime, another faction that covertly advocated Albanian irredentism in Kosovo and Macedonia emerged. Later in 1924, Pa≈°iƒá sent his strongman Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá in Kosovo to organize with local Serb officials D≈æemijet's suppression. In January 1925, Ferhat Draga along and other prominent leaders and journalists of the party's journal were arrested. He was sentenced to twenty years in prison, later released and then arrested and sentenced again to twenty years in prison in 1927. That same year, a leading intellectual of the party Nazim Gafurri, who was outspoken about the electoral abuses in the region, was assassinated.  Activities  In the Albanian-language schools as well as teaching in Albanian were banned and Albanians were allowed only to attend religious Muslim schools or secular Serbian-language ones. While trying to get legal recognition for the opening of Albanian-language schools in the parliament, the party also operated underground secular Albanian schools. After the party's ban, the school system continued with students smuggling Albanian books in Serbian schools and mullahs introducing Albanian secretly during religious courses.

Geographic range It is widespread in Central America and South America, including: Panama, Brazil, Colombia, Surinam, French Guiana, Guyana, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay. It is also found on the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, the Grenadines, Barbados, Margarita, Swan Island, and Isla de la Providencia.Ameiva ameiva Reptile Database It was also once present on Saint Vincent but has since been extirpated. Description Ameiva ameiva has a streamlined body, pointed head, slightly forked tongue, and muscular hind legs. They grow to approximately . Both sexes have random black specs and mottling along the sides. Females usually have much less green than males and a more dusty of a green color. Males have vibrant green coloration and more bold mottling. Males also have more expanded jowls. They are popular as a pet because of the male's striking green coloration. Habitat They live on the forest floor, often sheltering underneath logs and in leaf litter. Captive individuals have been observed making tunnels spanning out from under a log or rock when given enough soil. Diet Its diet consists of mainly insects, frogs, and spiders. In captivity, mealworms are a favorite of the ameiva along with crickets. Reproduction The female lays several clutches of eggs from March to December. Invasive species This species has been introduced into the United States with thriving populations in South Florida. Parasites This species is infected by a number of protist parasites including: *Acroeimeria pintoi *Choleoeimeria carinii *Plasmodium attenuatum *Plasmodium carmelinoi *Plasmodium cnemidophori *Plasmodium diminutivum *Plasmodium minasense *Plasmodium pifanoi *Plasmodium telfordi *Sarcocystis ameivamastigodryasi References * External links Ameiva ameiva at the Reptile Database Category:Ameiva Category:Reptiles of the Caribbean Category:Reptiles of Argentina Category:Reptiles of Bolivia Category:Reptiles of Brazil Category:Reptiles of Colombia Category:Reptiles of Ecuador Category:Reptiles of French Guiana Category:Reptiles of Guyana Category:Reptiles of Peru Category:Reptiles of Paraguay Category:Reptiles of Suriname Category:Reptiles of Venezuela Category:Reptiles described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Ameiva ameiva"},{"id":"9833820","text":"NASA image of Lukanga Swamp. Dark spots in the swamp are lagoons, elsewhere the swamp is covered in thick vegetation, mainly papyrus. Dark areas near the Kafue River are swamps with less vegetation. The overlay map shows main rivers, floodplain extent, and unpaved roads in yellow. Lukanga Swamp is a major wetland in the Central Province of Zambia, about 50 km west of Kabwe.Terracarta/International Travel Maps, Vancouver Canada: \\"Zambia, 2nd edition\\", 2000 Its permanently swampy area consists of a roughly circular area with a diameter of 40 to 50 km covering 1850 km2, plus roughly 250 km2 in the mouths of and along rivers discharging into it such as the Lukanga River from the north-east, plus another 500 km2 either side of the Kafue River to the west and north-west, making 2600 km2 in total.Google Earth accessed 2007. It contains many lagoons such as Lake Chiposhye and Lake Suye but few large channels, and its average depth is only 1.5 m. River connections and floodplains The permanent swamp is surrounded by a seasonally-inundated floodplain, varying from about 5 to 25 km wide in the south and east, up to 40 km in the north, and reaching the Kafue River and its swamps 25 km to the west and north-west. When the Kafue floods it overflows north-west through the normally dry Mwinuna channel and into the lower Lukanga River, while another channel drains out of the swamp back into the Kafue in the south-west. The Kafue meanders through its own swamps which are up to 10 km wide and extend for 90 km along the river. Numerous short rivers and streams flow into the swamp from the south, east and north, of which the Lukanga is the largest. In the rainy season the floodplains are inundated increasing the area of the wetland to 6000 km2, reaching a maximum of 8000 km2 at the peak flooding of a good rainy season. Human population and fishing There are several inhabited islands of higher ground which stay dry through the rainy season, mainly in an arc along the western edge of the permanent swamp, such as Chilwa Island and Chiposha Island. In addition the swamp contains floating islands of papyrus which support temporary fishing camps. No seasonal roads or bridges reach into the permanently swampy areas, and only one road crosses any part of the floodplain to any extent, a dry-season road from Kabwe (with a feeder from Mpongwe) going through Mukobwe and Ibondo to a ferry across the Kafue and on to Ngabwe. Two other dirt tracks come from Mumbwa in the south to the river near Mswebe and to the floodplain at Mwanamulambo. Despite its central location in the country, the Lukanga Swamp remains relatively inaccessible and even today government authorities in Kabwe and Lusaka have relatively little knowledge of or effect on the area. The inhabitants of villages mainly around the north-east, east and southern floodplain practise traditional methods of fishing in the swamps and farm the edge of the floodplain. There is no commercial fishing of any size, but FAO reported a 1980 estimate of 2600 t for the fish catch, sold in the markets of Lusaka, Kabwe, and the Copperbelt.D. Greboval et al.: \\"Fisheries characteristics of the shared lakes of the East African rift.\\" CIFA Technical Paper No. 24. Rome, FAO (1994) FAO website, accessed 4 March 2007. A more recent report puts the figure at 1,200 t and notes declining catches due to over-fishing.Global Environment Facility (GEF) : \\"Project Proposal, Zambia ‚Äî Community Based Natural Resources Management and Biodiversity Conservation in the Lukanga Swamps.\\" (2000). Website accessed 4 March 2007. There are some smaller commercial farms especially near the Great North Road which passes within 10 km of the floodplain at the south-eastern edge. Several large commercial farms and plantations, some with dry-season irrigation, have been established on the north side of the floodplain. Wildlife and conservation issues The floodplain is classed as the Zambezian flooded grasslands ecoregion, and the surrounding woodland savanna is the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands ecoregion, except on the south-east side which is Zambezian and mopane woodlands ecoregion. Flooded grasslands are considered to be productive and diverse owing to the nutrients brought by the flood and the fact they provide both grazing and aquatic habitats. The miombo woodland west of the Kafue River is a game management area stretching as far as Kafue National Park. Lukanga Swamp therefore could be considered a potential extension of that rich wildlife haven. Lukanga Swamp is home to 316 reported bird species. It supports populations of hippopotamus, and crocodile, and is considered an important site for conservation of lechwe, oribi, marsh mongoose, sitatunga, bushbuck, and python. The western side is visited by elephant, buffalo, eland and roan antelope. In 2000 the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) was reported to be under-resourced in the area and the swamps \\"are virtually unprotected, and poaching is excessive\\". Deforestation for charcoal production and for 'slash and burn' and other types of farming is also reported as a major threat to the Lukanga Swamp ecosystem mainly because it results in erosion of the land, turbidity of the water and siltation. In nearly all areas north-east of the swamp forests have been cleared especially for charcoal production, and land clearing for farming has been extensive on the north-east, east and southern sides of the swamp. Only the western side remains relatively untouched. The development of a tourism industry in the area, which (as has been seen for the national parks) results in greater wildlife conservation efforts, depends on providing access to this part from Mumbwa or Kabwe. Origin of Lukanga Swamp The nearly circular shape of the main permanent swamp has led to speculation that Lukanga Swamp may be an impact crater (astrobleme) formed by the impact of a meteorite.LPI- USRA Website accessed 1 March 2007. S. Master & W. U. Reimold: ‚ÄúThe Impact Cratering Record of Africa: An Updated Inventory of Proven, Probable, Possible, and Discredited Impact Structures on the African Continent.‚Äù Catastrophic Events Conference. However research on the ground in 2002 found no evidence of impact shock in rocks of the area, concluding that the Lukanga Swamp is not an astrobleme.IngentaConnect Website Katongo C.; Koeberl C.; Reimold W.U.; Mubu S.: ‚ÄúRemote sensing, field studies, petrography, and geochemistry of rocks in central Zambia: no evidence of a meteoritic impact in the area of the Lukanga Swamp.‚Äù Journal of African Earth Sciences, Volume 35, Number 3, October 2002, pp. 365-384. Accessed 1 March 2007. In the absence of other research data the origin of the swamp is unknown.
