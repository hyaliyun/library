It will be the second mall in the Vertis North township complex built by Ayala Malls inside Triangle Park, the first being TriNoma that was opened in 2007. The mall opened on June 9, 2017, after several unknown delays. Tagged as the \\"first millennial mall in the Philippines,\\" it will be Ayala Malls' fourth largest mall in Quezon City, after TriNoma, U.P. Town Center and Fairview Terraces. Features The mall has four retail clusters with four levels (except Southeast cluster with three levels and the North cluster having a basement access to Supermarket), flanking a central garden and events area called Green Strip. The mall has dedicated zones, known as Korea Town, Japan Town and Urban Turf. Three of the four retail clusters serve as the podiums of the 22-story Vertis North Corporate Center that is built on top of the retail clusters. A new large-format cinema (also known as A-Giant Screen) in addition to two digital cinemas with all-reclining seats (also known as A-Luxe Seats), with 400 regular seats and 24 reclining seats in the skybox, is known to be the largest cinema screen in the country. The mall features Merkado Supermarket as its anchor supermarket, that had a target opening date in August 2017 but it was delayed to December 14, 2017. The mall was originally intended to have a Wellworth Department Store but it was not pushed through as Wellworth was bought by the owners of Metro Gaisano Department Store. Instead, it is be occupied by fashion and lifestyle tenants. Despite being located on the same complex as TriNoma, it is not directly connected to the said mall though a covered walkway was built from the Mindanao Avenue open carpark of TriNoma to the mall and estate to provide access. The mall sits beside the spur line of the MRT-3 and has basement parking levels, unlike TriNoma, whose structure sits directly on top of the MRT-3 depot. Outside of the mall, an events place named ABS-CBN Vertis Tent was opened on July 24, 2017 in partnership with media conglomerate ABS-CBN Corporation. It has a seating capacity of 1,200 for shows by local and foreign artists. Notable events British band The Vamps along with British pop trio New Hope Club held their Manila show for The Vamps‚Äô ‚ÄúMiddle Of The Night Tour‚Äù last October 6, 2017 at the Luna Drive which is the main road for the mall, the road was closed for the day to support the temporary arena like stage for the concert.

At long, it is New Zealand's longest road tunnel. The tunnel, with three lanes of road vehicle traffic in each direction, connects State Highway 20 in the south at Mount Roskill to State Highway 16 in the west at Point Chevalier as part of the Waterview Connection. Its opening completed the Western Ring Route motorway system.  Planning history  'The project had an extensive planning history, with the earliest consultation in 2000, though the proposal for a route roughly in the area dates from much earlier.[citation needed]  Purpose  The Waterview Tunnel completed the Western Ring Route which provides a second route through Auckland. For those travelling from North to South (or vice versa) the route enables users to bypass the city centre and reduces reliance on SH1 and the Auckland Harbour Bridge. It also provides a direct motorway link from the central city through to Auckland Airport, a route which has in the past relied on the use of local roads.  Project alliance  The Waterview Tunnel and greater Waterview Connection project was delivered by the Well-Connected Alliance. This was a partnership between the NZ Transport Agency, Fletcher Construction, McConnell Dowell, Parsons Brinckerhoff, Beca Infrastructure, Tonkin+Taylor, and Obayashi Corporation. Wilson Tunnelling and SICE were sub-alliance partners.  Construction  = Concrete lining = A purpose-built factory was constructed in East Tamaki, Auckland to produce the 2414 concrete rings needed to line the tunnels. Each ring is two metres wide (length) and 14 metres in diameter. They consist of 10 precast segments, each of which weighs 10.5 tonnes. Five rejected segments were used to create a Soldiers Memorial on the Village Green at Te Kauwhata. = Tunnel boring machine = Alice the TBM near the start of her journey in October 2013. Te Hauranga Hau, an artwork designed for the project, can be seen on the left. An Earth Pressure Balance tunnel boring machine (TBM) was built specifically for the Waterview Tunnel at the Herrenknecht factory, Guangzhou, China. Made up of 90 pieces, the TBM was 14 metres in diameter, 97 metres long, and had a top speed of 80mm per minute. The TBM arrived in Auckland on 22 July 2013, a launch ceremony was held on 31 October 2013, and excavation work began on 8 November 2013. Nicknamed \\"Alice\\" following a public vote, the TBM was the 11th largest machine of this type in the world. Alice bored the twin tunnels in two passes to a depth of up to 45 metres so as to pass below hard rock, the water table, and sea level. The southbound tunnel, excavated from south to north, was holed through on 29 September 2014. Alice completed the return journey on 19 October 2015 and was dismantled in early 2016 before being transported in sections to the Port of Auckland for shipment back to the German manufacturer. = Cross-passage excavation = Work on the excavation of cross-passages between the two tunnels began in early 2015.[citation needed] Sixteen cross- passages were built to enable evacuation of people from one tunnel to the other in the event of an emergency and to house tunnel operation equipment. Each cross-passage is around 11 metres long. The excavation was completed in December 2015.  Safety features  The tunnels include a number of features to ensure safe use by vehicles. Safety features include electronic message boards, speed cameras, public address systems, radio sound systems, CCTV cameras, and ventilation and fire sprinkler systems. Traffic is monitored by dedicated Tunnel Operators and computerised systems. Emergency exits and telephones are installed every 150 metres along the length of each tunnel. Overheight detection systems prevent oversize vehicles entering, and on-ramp signals regulate traffic flow.  Closures and detour route  The tunnels will be partially or fully closed for scheduled maintenance at times, usually between the hours of 10pm and 5am. A detour route through Great North Road, Blockhouse Bay Road, Tiverton Road, New Windsor Road, and Maioro Street will be utilised at these times. The detour will also be permanently in place for prohibited vehicles.  Prohibited vehicles  Dangerous Goods Vehicles (i.e. those requiring a placard), vehicles over 4.3m high, and vehicles carrying uncovered loads are prohibited from using the tunnels. They are required to take the detour route.  Completion date  In 2016, the completion date for Waterview Tunnel was estimated as mid-April 2017. A delay was announced in March 2017, with the date pushed out by \\"two-three months\\" after faults were found in the deluge system and software. On 11 June 2017 it was announced that the tunnel would open in early July 2017. The tunnels opened on 2 July 2017 with the first cars passing through at 12:47 am escorted by three police vehicles.  Te Haerenga Hou (artwork)  Auckland artist Graham Tipene created an artwork named Te Haerenga Hou (meaning New Journey) for the entranceway to the tunnel. The artwork depicts the journey from the Manukau Harbour, past the volcanoes of Te Ara P≈´eru /MƒÅngere, Te H≈çpua (Gloucester Park), Maungakiekie (One Tree Hill) and PuketƒÅpapa (Mt Roskill), to the feet of ≈åwairaka (Mt Albert), following the path of the tunnels. The work also incorporates the story of lovers Tamaireia and Hinemairangi, whose elopement is said to have led to the creation of the region's volcanoes.

General concepts  We can solve the inverse dynamics of a system to obtain joint torques and nonetheless be unable to estimate the forces exerted by single muscles even knowing the exact geometry of our joints and muscles due to the redundancy of our system. Through an optimization approach we could find a way to understand how our central nervous system chooses its control strategies so as to optimize some aspects of movement production (e.g. minimizing metabolic cost). = Dynamic equations of motion = We use here the matricial form of the equations of motion M(\\\\textbf{q})\\\\ddot{\\\\textbf{q}} +\\\\textbf{C}(\\\\textbf{q},\\\\dot{\\\\textbf{q}}) + \\\\textbf{G}(\\\\textbf{q}) + \\\\textbf{E} + \\\\textbf{T}_{MT}=0 in which we are considering a body part with j joints and m muscles.

The choice of the cost function  Our choice of the cost function is based on the supposed optimization mechanisms carried on by our CNS. It needs to be clinically validated, especially in unhealthy patients. In [Erdemir, 2007] a list of possible cost functions with a brief rationale and the suggested model validation technique is available.  Clarification on the use of the maximum isometric force  Muscle contraction can be eccentric (velocity of contraction v<0), concentric (v >0) or isometric (v=0). From muscle force- velocity characteristic we notice that muscle force in an eccentric contraction is higher than the maximum isometric force, why then do we use it as a constraint on muscle force? Mainly for two reasons: * Rarely do muscle contraction occur with total activation (a=1), then eccentric contraction force is lowered proportionally to the value of activation; * The maximum isometric force is a remarkable and fixed value of force given the physiological cross-sectional area of a muscle (they are linked by the concept of specific tension of a muscle).

Ginell of Allmusic wrote \\"Still in exile from his homeland, Hugh Masekela leaves no doubt where he would rather be in this carefully produced, majestically swinging, techno-pop-jazz album that leans heavily in the direction of Soweto. Masekela often performs sophisticated takes on three-chord township jive, leading the massed vocals with his own coarse yet evocatively blunt voice, while leaving himself just enough room to peel off a few patented, repeated-note trumpet licks and double-tracked flugelhorn statements. Later on the record, the keys turn minor but the high- tech verve is still there. The key track is a fine version of Masekela's signature tune of the '80s, \\"Bring Him Back Home,\\" which became prophetic in the next decade with the release of Nelson Mandela from prison (though the \\"walking hand in hand with Winnie Mandela\\" bit didn't last long).\\" Robert Christgau commented \\"The words document his losses, his struggle, his oppression as a South African exile. I learned from them, and that's high praise for any lyric. The music documents the life he wants to lead, which is as corny as any other dance-fusion jazz played by musicians overimpressed with their own chops. He has a right to that life, obviously.

It has a rosette of leaves and eight to fifteen translucent white flowers with green and brown markings and a brownish, insect-like labellum. It is a rare species only known from a small area and is endangered.Labelled image of P. basaltica Description Pterostylis basaltica, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a rosette of between eight and fifteen leaves at the base of the flowering spike, each leaf long and wide. The leaves are egg-shaped and pointed and have usually withered by the time the flowers open. Up to fifteen translucent white flowers with green and brown markings, long and wide are borne on a flowering spike tall. Three to five stem leaves are wrapped around the flowering spike. The dorsal sepal and petals form a hood over the column with the dorsal sepal having an upturned point long. The lateral sepals turn downwards, are more or less parallel, joined at their bases and with a few short white hairs. The lateral sepals have thread-like tips long and spreading apart from each other. The labellum is thick, brownish, fleshy, insect-like, about long and wide. There are six to eight pairs of spreading white hairs on the sides of the labellum and four shorter hairs on the swollen \\"head\\" end. Flowering occurs from November to December. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis basaltica was first formally described in 1993 by David Jones and Mark Clements from a specimen collected near Woorndoo and the description was published in Muelleria. The specific epithet (basaltica) refers to the basaltic soils in which this species usually grows. Distribution and habitat The basalt rustyhood is only known from a single small area near Derrinallum with two populations on western basalt plains grassland in south-western Victoria. Conservation One population of P. basaltica occurs on a roadside reserve and has about 1,000 plants and the other, on private property, about 20 plants. None are in a conservation reserve. The main threats to the species are weed invasion, habitat disturbance, altered fire regimes and grazing. The species is classified as \\"Threatened\\" by the Victorian Government and as \\"Endangered\\" (EN) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and a recovery plan has been prepared.

A video game may be protected as a creative work. Whether or not a work is copyrighted, and the duration of the copyright may differ between countries, and may also be limited by country specific exceptions, like the fair use doctrine in the United States.  Historic status of video games in copyright  With the establishment of international intellectual property treaties like the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the TRIPS (Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights), there have been global standards set for subject matters of protection, but video games are not covered as a category of their own. Instead, the protection of video games relies on interpretations of pre-existing categories. Earlier, before the TRIPS required member countries to recognize software as copyrightable, software programs were not allowed to be protected directly. After this protection was given to software, video games started to become popular and started to seek protection under this new subject-matter but were either not allowed the same or the protection that was given was very restrictive. Even today the protections given to a video game in various jurisdictions is restricted because, in most countries, multiple copyrights are required to protect different components of a game.  Issues with copyrighting games  = Game creation = There are multiple aspects about video game creation that have led to different components of the software being copyrighted separately; some cannot be copyrighted at all because of their existence in the public domain or Creative Commons.  Common assets  There is a plethora of websites which allow creators to 'borrow' assets to implement in- game. The model of granting access and permission to use these assets differs across websites and may range from an upfront payment to a portion of profits (if the assets are used commercially). This is not an issue with large video game publishers (such as EA, Activision, or Sony), but when these self- contained companies create large and detailed worlds, most of the assets they create end up being used only once. This limits the public pool of resources/assets. Assets will often have to be recreated in order to create a new game (or sequel by another company or creator), which is a common complaint of game developers, as it usually costs large amounts of money to create commercially viable assets and makes it difficult for smaller developers to produce games.  Game engines  A game engine is a framework which a developer can use to create games. They consist of a software suite with a multitude of components, such as a rendering engine, audio engine, physics engine, and artificial intelligence. Companies create these engines for the purpose of allowing developers (with or without charge) to create games. However, because of limitations or certain peculiarities of an engine, some designs or passive-background tasks may occur in a particular way for every game made using that engine. This particular feature (regardless of how central it may be to a game) essentially the same in all games created with that engine, which takes it outside the scope of copyright. This reasoning would also apply to games made with the same engine which share source code--this would not constitute copying because the games' similarity is inherent to the tools. Large video game houses/publishers can sidestep this limitation by developing in-house engines.  Producers-developers relation  Classically, publishers had the role of securing (or providing) funding for a game, as well as bearing the losses and in many cases, marketing the game. These expenses were generally large and could run as high as tens of millions of dollars for AAA titles. But, with the advent of the Internet and the rise of indie culture, a new wave of financing and distribution technologies has emerged. Sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow for interested consumers to directly contribute towards game development by purchasing the game in advance. Digital distributors like Steam and GOG.com removed the costly need for the manufacture and distribution of physical game discs. These innovations have allowed the industry to move away from the standard of intellectual property rights resting with the publisher instead of the developers, as \\"the IP rights that typically vested with publishers may now be shared with a publisher or owned by a developer or an investment vehicle\\".  Music creators, voice actors and other contributors  Contributions that do not add directly to the code of the game would not be protected by copyrights for literary works, but these components could be covered if an audiovisual copyright is taken out. As for authorship rights, most contributors are employees and hence their work would be considered \\"work for hire\\", belonging not to them, but to their employer. Music is generally not created in-house by game developers; since third parties are hired, this may not result in a work for hire. See U.S court case CCNV v. Reid, on the principle work for hire. = Gameplay =  Hardware limitations  Some copyrightable elements of a game may be created due to hardware limitations. For example, the classic game Space Invaders, as originally played as an arcade game, got faster as the player killed more of the onscreen aliens, which freed up system resources.  User input  User input is essential component of video games, which are interactive media. Though this may not change the intellectual property rights in the base code of the game, some developers/publishers may restrict the rights of players to broadcast their playthrough of the game. The arguments from the other side are that the output of a game is coming in a particular way due to user input and this can reasonably give a player some restricted rights in his/her play through, also known as a Let's Play.  International standard  The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (The Berne Convention of 1886) is the international treaty which provides the scope for copyright protection of video games. This protection can be drawn from the wide definition of \\"Literary and Artistic Work\\" in Article 2 of the Convention, which reads: > The expression \\"literary and artistic works\\" shall include every production > in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or > form of its expression, such as books, pamphlets and other writings; > lectures, addresses, sermons and other works of the same nature; dramatic or > dramatico-musical works; choreographic works and entertainments in dumb > show; musical compositions with or without words; cinematographic works to > which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to > cinematography; works of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, > engraving and lithography; photographic works to which are assimilated works > expressed by a process analogous to photography; works of applied art; > illustrations, maps, plans, sketches and three-dimensional works relative to > geography, topography, architecture or science. This standard treats the whole game as a singular component but does not define what would be covered by such a protection and what would be excluded. WIPO had recognized the complexity inherent in copyrighting video games, saying: \\"Although Article 2 of the Berne Convention provides a solid basis for eligibility for protection of video games by copyright, they are in fact complex works of authorship, potentially composed of multiple copyrighted works.\\" WIPO has also stated in one of its reports that \\"there is no clear classification of video games and their protection will vary depending on each particular game and the elements that are part of it. In this sense, video games can be treated as computer programs and, thus, are classified as works of authorship; in that case, the source code for a video game is classified as a literary work. If pictorial or graphic authorship predominates, a video game may be classified as a visual arts work. Similarly, if motion picture or audiovisual authorship predominates, a video game may be classified as a motion picture/audiovisual work.\\"  Comparative analysis about inclusion of copyright protection  WIPO has written the following about copyright protection in different countries and jurisdictions: \\"For some countries, video games are predominantly computer programs, due to the specific nature of the works and their dependency on software. Whereas in other jurisdictions, the complexity of video games implies that they are given a distributive classification. Finally, few countries consider that video games are essentially audiovisual works.\\" = United States = The US Copyright Act 17 U.S.C, Section 102 enumerates the requirements of a copyright in the US, but does not use the term. For a work to be copyrightable under the Copyright Act it must meet the threshold of originality, be fixed in a medium (whether analog or digital) and the work must be perceivable and reproducible. Regarding copyrights for video games, the US Copyright office has stated that \\"a single registration may be made for a computer program and its screen displays...(and) when answering the 'Type of work being registered' question on the application form, the copyright holder shall choose the type most appropriate to the predominant authorship.\\" In other words, US Law does not specify a certain protection to be given to a game. The individual(s) registering the game, or their attorneys, must ascertain which category best protect the interests of the author/assignee. The US Copyright Office specifically states that ‚ÄúCopyright does not protect the idea for a game, its name or title, or the method or methods for playing it. Nor does copyright protect any idea, system, method, device, or trademark material involved in developing, merchandising, or playing a game.‚Äù The legal standard for copyright may differ, depending on the circumstances.  Idea/expression dichotomy  The issue of the idea expression dichotomy was discussed in one of the first video game issues to reach litigation, Atari v. Amusement World (1981). The case was resolved a copyright issue between Ataris Asteroids game (plaintiff) and a similar game Meteors (respondent). The court ruled in favor of the respondents, finding that the similarities between the games were limited to the plaintiff's ideas. According to the court the similarities, \\"were inevitable given the requirements of the idea of a game involving a spaceship combating space rocks and given the technical demands of the medium of a video game.\\"  Substantial similarity test  In Atari v. North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp. (1982) the 7th Circuit wrote that \\"no plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his work he did not pirate.\\" This was said in the context of the fact that, \\"while a game is not protectable by copyright as such, this kind of work of authorship is protectable at least to a limited extent as long as the particular form in which it is expressed provides something new or additional over the idea\\" and that while two works may not be the same in many regards, if parts/components of the second work or wholly or substantially copied or like the first work, it is copyright infringement.  Subtractive approach test  Nichols v. Universal Pictures laid out the following test for copyrighted material which contains both copyrightable and public domain material. The Case lays down 3 steps to be followed to ascertain copying: # The allegedly infringed work is analyzed to determine the parts that are protected, # The unprotected parts are subtracted, and # The fact finder examines significant similarities between what remains of the allegedly infringed work and the allegedly infringing work. This Subtractive Approach is the preferred Test by Courts in the US (save the 9th Circuit ), = Abstraction-filtration-comparison test = This test, developed in Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc. (1992) was specifically aimed at software infringement and hence is a better fit for what a court is likely to apply with regards video games. The test, like the Subtractive test before it, lays down 3 steps: # Abstraction ‚Äì Ascertain each level of abstraction. # Filtration ‚Äì Identify factors at each level that are not deserving of protection (ideas, processes, those dictated by efficiency or required for external compatibility, those taken from the public domain, etc.) and subtract them from consideration. # Comparison ‚Äì Compare the remaining components for infringement.  Authorship  In the U.S, corporations can be the author of an audiovisual work, which tends to be the most commonly used classification for a video game. In this case, the hiring corporation, rather than employees or other contributors, would be considered the author. Unlike European Law, which has very strong \\"Moral Right Protections\\", moral rights in American law are limited to works of visual arts as defined by Section 101 of the U.S. Copyright Act (Act). This definition excludes \\"motion pictures or other audiovisual works\\" or any works made for hire. There are developments in this field due to the advancement of technology as well. Services like 'Steam Workshop' allows for players to use tools provided by the game developer to add to the game in some manner. Usually, since these players are not employees copyright of their works usually resides with them. = India = The Indian Copyright Act of 1975, does not address video games specifically. Unlike the US, India has not publicly listed under what categorization video game makers should seek protection under. India follows the Anglo-American tradition of allowing corporate persons to hold copyrights.  Applicable law  The Indian law has an exhaustive definition of the phrase \\"Artistic Work\\" under Chapter 1, Section 2(c) of the Copyrights Act, which states that Artistic Work is \\"(i) a painting, a sculpture, a drawing, an engraving or a photograph, whether or not any such work possesses artistic quality; (ii) a work of architecture; and (iii) any other work of artistic craftsmanship.\\" Due to the specificity of the statute, the law on video games in India has developed more on the basis of business practice. This has led to developers and publishers seeking protection as \\"cinematograph works\\". Under Section 2 of the act, a \\"cinematograph film\\" means \\"any work of visual recording on any medium produced through a process from which a moving image may be produced by any means and includes a sound recording accompanying such visual recording and cinematograph shall be construed as including any work produced by any process analogous to cinematography including video films.\\" The phrase \\"process analogous to cinematography\\" has a non-exhaustive list attached, meaning that part of the definition is open-ended enough to allow for video games to be covered, but there is no jurisprudence on this issue.) The law in India does clearly state that a \\"literary work\\" includes computer programsChapter 1, Section 2(o) of the Indian Copyright Act: \\"literary work includes computer programmes, tables, and compilations including computer databases.\\" and hence by extension, the source code of video games can be protected as software or literary work.  Authorship  Unlike the US, in India, different aspects of a game, like the art, code, gameplay mechanics etc. are copyrightable independently.Rawandale, C. J., Ryder, R. & ASSOCHAM (2011) ‚ÄúCreating Virtual Wealth: Importance of Intellectual Property in the Animation & Gaming Industry\\" This understanding is furthered by Section 17 of the Indian Copyright Act which states that the person arranging for all components of a work to come together into a cohesive whole would be the one to hold the copyright in the work, only if all works are created under a contract of service as stated in Section 17 (c): > \\"In the case of a work made in the course of the author's employment under a > contract of service or apprenticeship (...) the employer shall, in the > absence of any agreement to the contrary, be the first owner of the > copyright therein\\" Under this rule, the authorship of creative contributions to a game that are made by individuals outside of the developers/publishers employment reside with the original creator, unless the rights are signed over to the developer.  Contributors  Contributors like musicians and lyricists, having once consented to have their works in a cinematograph work, can no longer restrict or object to the enjoyment of the performer‚Äôs rights by the producer but the original author/creator shall retain the right to receive royalties on public/commercial use of his/her work, as per Section 38 A (2) of the Indian Copyright Act. \\"It is unclear whether this new provision will affect video game authors due to the lack of qualification of this kind of work of authorship; this amendment to the Indian Copyright Act must, therefore, be further interpreted in this context...(it) must be interpreted by Indian courts in order to determine if it will apply to video game contributors and whether they shall have the right to receive royalties for the exploitation of their works.\\"  Test and Remedies  The landmark case for deciding on infringement cases in India is R.G. Anand, which laid out the following test: if \\"the viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original\\" then the copyright has been infringed.

A member of the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame, he is known as the \\"Father of Canadian Soccer\\". Early and personal life Forsyth was born in Perthshire, Scotland, in 1852. His family emigrated to Canada when he was one year old, settling in the village of Lynden, Ontario. Educated at local schools in Lynden, then Dundas High School and Galt Collegiate Institute, he went on to study mathematics at the University of Toronto, graduating with a silver medal in 1875. He was married to Augusta Mylius from 1882 until her death in 1912. Education career After graduating, Forsyth became master of mathematics and science at Berlin High School in Berlin, Ontario, where he was the first science teacher in Ontario to introduce practical laboratory work for students. Having acquired an interest in soccer while at university, he was also responsible for popularizing the sport at the school and in the Berlin area generally. He eventually became principal of Berlin High School in 1901. The school became one of the most prominent in Ontario during Forsyth's career there; William Lyon Mackenzie King, a future Prime Minister of Canada, was one of his pupils. He also served on a Royal Commission on Industrial Training and Technical Education. Soccer career Forsyth was an influential figure in the early history of soccer in Berlin, which he introduced at Berlin High School in the late 1870s. As the sport spread throughout the local area, the Western Football Association (WFA) was formed in January 1880, with Forsyth as its first secretary-treasurer, a post he held until 1906. He also served as president and honorary president. The Berlin High School team, with Forsyth playing as a forward, won the WFA Challenge Cup four years running from 1880 to 1883. Forsyth was also one of the founders of the Berlin town football club, later known as the Berlin Rangers, which formed around 1884 and won the Challenge Cup in 1885. Forsyth represented Canada as a player in the country's first (unofficial) soccer international matches. He was a member of the WFA- organized teams that travelled to Newark, New Jersey to play against a United States team in November 1885 and November 1886. In 1888, Forsyth was the organizer of the Canadian team that toured the British Isles, playing against several leading club sides and also playing an unofficial international against a Scotland XI. Forsyth acted as secretary during the tour, and also played in occasional matches. He was also involved in the initial planning of another British tour in 1891, but resigned before it took place. Forsyth was also a founder member of the Ontario Football Association in 1901, serving as their secretary until 1906. He was president of the WFA from 1915 to 1920, and secretary again from 1921 to 1923. He was later made honorary president of the Dominion of Canada Football Association. Other interests and later life Forsyth was a Kitchener Public Library board member for over 30 years, serving as secretary and chairman. He was a member of the Berlin Board of Health, Waterloo Historical Society, Mathematical Association of Canada, American Association of Science and the National Geographic Society. Amongst his other sporting achievements, he captained the Berlin lacrosse team and was a prominent member of the Berlin Cricket Club, and was also involved in cycling, canoeing, lawn bowling, and curling. A freemason, he was a member of Grand River Lodge No. 151 in Waterloo. After his retirement from teaching in 1921, Forsyth moved to Beamsville, Ontario, in 1924, where his son Otto lived, and became a fruit farmer. He died in Beamsville in 1936 and was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Kitchener. Legacy Forsyth was inducted into the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame in 2000 as one of the builders of the sport in Canada. The Hall of Fame describes him as the \\"Father of Canadian Soccer\\".

She was deeply engaged in New York Society as a member and president of numerous society organizations. She supported women's suffrage, poverty alleviation, social causes, and civic engagement. Known socially as \\"Mrs. William Foster Rowland,\\" her name demanded respect and was prominently featured in New York papers. Her legacy was survived through her daughter and socialite, Lillian Wick Neale (died 1992), and her son-in-law, John Henry Neale II.  Early life  Ester Louise Osborn was born in Brooklyn, New York City to Henry Osborn, a prominent hotelier and political organizer, and Mary Jane Whiteford Osborn in 1870. Her father owned and operated the famous Osborn Hotel, which entertained many athletes and renowned jockeys. The hotel was located in Sheepshead Bay on the water next to a horse racetrack. Henry was an accomplished rower in his youth and the hotel therefore hosted rowers for local regattas as well. Essie was the oldest of 8 children (3 survived to adulthood). She was raised under privileged circumstances by always being in the company of prominent Brooklyn families, hotel guests, jockeys, and yachtsmen. She grew up during the last few decades that Brooklyn was still an independent city. Essie attended private school in Brooklyn where she continually received praise for her skills in entertainment. She was known for her elocution, that is performance and speech-giving. In fact, she was noted for her outstanding performance of elocution with the Prima Donna of the Stockholm Grand Opera, Ms. Bertha Wichman.  Marriage  Essie's first husband was John Wick, a prominent New York businessman who ran one of the largest and most successful stove manufacturing businesses in the country‚Äîa technology that was at the time cutting edge. They were married in 1897. Essie and John had their one and only child, Lillian Osborn Wick, on September 9, 1898. John suffered from pulmonary troubles and the couple decided to move South to Greenville, SC for a better climate 1901. Essie and John quickly became entrenched in the upper class of Greenville, South Carolina where they lived in a suite of rooms in Mansion House. They acquired property to begin building an estate and had John's award-winning horse shipped down from New York. Despite hopes of better health in the amiable climate, John's health deteriorated and he died from tuberculosis in 1903. The widowed Essie was escorted to Washington, DC with her young daughter Lill. From DC, Essie's brother Thomas DeWitt Osborn brought her and Lill back to New York. At the time, Thomas was a rising politician in Brooklyn. Not shorter than a year later, tragedy struck Essie's life again when Thomas was killed in a trolley collision with his horse-drawn carriage. Thomas was returning from a political meeting when he was struck and killed by the trolley. He was the youngest Democratic politician in Brooklyn, a rising powerhouse, and a NYU Law Class of 1901 graduate.  Second Marriage  Following the deaths of her father, husband, and brother, Essie focused on raising Lill and continuing her involvement in social causes. She supported the suffragette movement, access to education for disadvantaged children, and social organization of women through clubs. Lill was raised within this polite society environment and attended the Packer Institute in Brooklyn Heights. Ester Louise Osborn Wick later on, in 1912, married a widower William Foster Rowland. Rowland was involved in New York City millinery business. Three years later she found herself a widow again when her second husband died of a heart attack. Out of two marriages, she was really only a married woman for seven years. Following his death, Essie further entrenched herself in social clubs throughout New York City.  Society and Later Life  Essie went by Mrs. William Foster Rowland in polite society news coverage. She was respected throughout New York City society as an active socialite, clubwoman, and leader. She ran many club events, charitable charges, and was honored by prominent club leaders. Essie was also known for her fashion, hosting a number of fashion programs through Clio. She was also named one of the 5 best dressed clubwomen in 1933. In the 1920s, Essie was a member and president of Clio, one of the country's oldest women's clubs. In 1935 she was elected President of the Women's Federation of New York Clubs. In 1939, she received the honor of being appointed to the Committee on Women's Participation of the New York World's Fair. During this time Lill married John Henry Neale II. Essie would spend much of her time with her daughter and son-in-law, and eventually her two grandsons, Thomas DeWitt Neale (named in honor of her brother) and John Henry Neale III. She frequented the Hamptons enjoying the summer season at Red Oaks (estate). Into old age, Essie continued to give speeches at club events. She lived to see her first few great-grandchildren born before passing away in 1957. Essie is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.

Each of them were shot execution-style with several bullets in the head..  Investigations  According to investigations by French authorities, it is possible that Mƒ∞T (Turkey's National Intelligence Organization) is involved in the murders. The suspected murderer, √ñmer G√ºney, was a 34 year old Turkish maintenance employee at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. Video cameras at the site of the murder show that he was inside the building between 00:11 and 00:56 when the deaths occurred. Gunpowder was found on his bag. Technical investigations were performed on his Nokia mobile phone and experts decrypted it and restored deleted files. They found images taken the day before (January 8) establishing that he was in the premises of a Kurdish association in Villers-le-Bel between 4:23 and 5:33 in the morning and took pictures of 329 memberships files. Two days before, he took pictures of accounting tracing alleged racketeering activity inside the Kurdish community.http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/fait-divers/kurdes- assassinees-la-piste-politique_1312649.html A few months after these murders, an audio recording between √ñmer G√ºney and suspected MIT agents was released on the Internet.

Anti-terrorist judge Jeanne Duy√© was in charge of investigations; in September 2013, her computer was stolen from her home in a burglary. √ñmer G√ºney was in jail from January 21, 2013. The French antiterror- unit Sdat found a passport with three stamps from journeys to Turkey behind the radio in a car he borrowed the day of the murder. The judge considered the involvement of Turkish secret services in the murder to be a possibility, but didn't establish who ordered the operation and if the murderer acted according to the will of the top management or not (in theory, this may have been an attempt to stall peace talks that were occurring between Ankara and the PKK at that time). On December 13, 2016, √ñmer G√ºney was moved to a hospital for urgent care connected to his brain tumor and he died the next day, five weeks before the scheduled start of his trial.¬´ Omer G√ºney, assassin pr√©sum√© de trois militantes kurdes √† Paris, meurt avant son proc√®s ¬ª, 20minutes.fr, accessed date 17 december 2016.,le parisien 13 August 2015 Shortly after G√ºney died, France decided to close the investigation into the murders.

Life He was the second son of the infantry general Prince Peter Petrovich Dolgorukov (1744-1815) and Princess Anastasia Simonovna (n√©e Lapteva). His mother was an intelligent woman who ensured that Peter and his brothers Vladimir and Mikhail got a good education. He is recorded as being in the Izmailovsky Life Guards Regiment in March 1778 and became a captain in the Moscow Grenadier Regiment in January 1792. In June the following year he was made adjutant to his relation Yuri Vladimirovich Dolgorukov. In November 1795 he transferred to the garrison regiment in Moscow and became a lieutenant colonel, followed by full colonel in May 1797. He was put in command of the city of Smolensk in September 1798 and promoted to major general. For three months he reformed its judicial system, which had fallen into neglect, and sent the tsar a report on the city's nobility and their devotion to the tsar - this attracted Paul I's attention and he appointed Dolgorukov an adjutant general aged only 21. When Alexander I of Russia came to the throne, he immediately promoted Dolgorukov during the first year of his reign. In 1802 he audited the provinces of Grodno and Vilnius, travelled to Berlin twice to consolidate Russia's friendly relations with the Kingdom of Prussia and managed to avoid a rupture with Sweden on a trip there to resolve disagreements over the Swedish-Russian borders in Finland. When war broke out with the First French Empire in 1805 he returned to Berlin to try to persuade the Prussian king to act in concert with Russia and the Austrian Empire. Before the battle of Austerlitz Napoleon sent general Anne Jean Marie Ren√© Savary to Alexander I to offer a personal meeting between Napoleon and the tsar. Alexander declined to go himself and in his place sent Dolgorukov, who was very much in favour of the war and confident the Russian troops could beat Napoleon. He was received graciously by Napoleon but responded proudly and arrogantly, rejecting all of Napoleon's proposals and presenting his own proposals brusquely. He reported back to Alexander that Napoleon was afraid of fighting the Russian army and insisted on giving battle, contrary to the opinion of Mikhail Kutuzov - Russian officers and noblemen thus later gave Dolgorukov most of the blame for the ensuing defeat. During the battle he was an infantry commander in Prince Pyotr Bagration's corps, showing great courage and repulsing the enemy attacks several times. He was sent back to Berlin on the day after the battle to induce Frederick William III of Prussia to declare war on Napoleon as soon as possible. In autumn 1806 Alexander instructed Dolgorukov to inspect the army gathered in southern Russia ready for the Russo-Turkish War (1806‚Äì1812), but before he had completed his inspection he received orders to come to St Petersburg immediately to discuss the Russian response to the Prussian defeat at Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt. He galloped to St Petersburg so quickly that several times he overtook his own adjutants and he arrived tired and broken. Alexander received him immediately and had a long meeting with him, but that same evening Dolgorukov fell ill and was put up in a room in the Winter Palace. The doctors diagnosed typhoid fever but could do nothing for him and he died a week later.

The southern sandslider has one supraocular (scales lying above the eyes) between the eyes and no supraciliaries (small scales along the outer margin of the upper eyelid). An adult female southern sandslider is generally much longer than an adult male. The females can reach approximately 38 to 60 mm (snout-to-vent) in length. The males only reach between 37 and 55 mm (snout-to-vent) in length.  Taxonomy  There are eight synonym for the southern sandslider, these include: * Lerista labialis (STORR 1971: 69) * Lerista labialis (COGGER 1983: 174) * Rhodona rolloi (WELLS & WELLINGTON 1985: 37 (fide SHEA & SADLIER 1999)) * Lerista labialis (GREER 1990) * Lerista labialis (COGGER 2000: 523) * Gaia labialis (WELLS 2012: 202) * Gaia rolloi (WELLS 2012: 206) * Lerista labialis (WILSON & SWAN 2010)  Distribution  Lerista labialis Distribution Southern sandsliders are found throughout the desert plains of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Western Queensland and New South Wales. Southern sandsliders are most commonly found within the dune crests. This is mainly due to the suitability of this habitat in that it provides them with optimum temperatures, an adequate supply of food and the vegetation sparseness results in soft sandy areas that can aid in the reduction of energy costs (being able to move easily).  Ecology and habitat  Southern sandsliders are fossorial, nocturnal (night-active), and terrestrial. They have a very narrow preferred body temperature range, ranging between 21‚Äì36 ¬∞C. They are found within dunes not only for the availability of food but for its thermoregulation. The southern sandslider swims through the loose sand of termite mounds. They are abundant in sandy deserts with vegetation cover that is sparse on dune crests. This benefits the species allowing for unrestrained burrowing. Dunes provide an optimum temperature for the survival of the skinks as well as providing their food source.  Reproduction  The southern sandsliders breed throughout summer, however the Lerista species tend to breed in winter during the dry season. They lay shelled eggs within November and February with the clutch size generally being an average of 2. The southern sandsliders sex cannot be determined by an external examination, the only way to determine the sex of the individual is through internal examination.  Diet  Southern sandsiders have diets that consume mostly termites, and this makes up at least 78% of their diet, with the last 22% resulting in invertebrate classes including that of Hemiptera, Neuroptera etc. The southern sandsliders catch their food by foraging below the ground surface Southern sandsliders forage late at night to the early morning between the surface and just below finding termites and other invertebrates. Not only do they ingest termites and invertebrates, the sandsliders also consume sand. The sand is ingested and is used to aid in the digestion. Overall, the termites can offer a reliable food source for the southern sandslider. With the increase in rainfall, the southern sandslider benefits from this. The increase in rainfall impacts on the Spinifex species, these species become more abundant with the increase in water availability, spinifex is the diet of termites. With an increase of food availability for the termites, these will cause an increase of termite population. Thus, as the southern sandsliders pray becomes more abundant so will the southern sandslider. Southern sandsliders are not affected by the seasonal changes but are rain dependent on their food availability, however they will source other species of prey if they need to. They do not need to drink; as they receive water and re-hydrate through the food they eat.  Predators  The Southern sandslider take refuge in dunes to protect themselves from surface-active predators and also the harm of the extreme temperatures within its environment. There are two main predators of the southern sandslider, these are the snake Simoselaps fasciolatus and the skink Eremiascincus fasciolatus.  Threats  There are currently no major threats for the Southern sandslider, their protection status is considered as least concerned wildlife.

Initially concerned with working conditions and voting rights, its interests were extended over the years. The movement was dissolved in 2005 when the Labour Party adopted equal gender distribution in all its bodies, both national and local. In its place, a looser \\"women's network\\" was set up within the party in order to bring women into leadership roles at all levels. History The Women's Federation has been the most important organization in Norway's labour women's movement despite challenges in 1937 from the Labour Housewives Group (Norges Husmorlagsforbund) affiliated with the Communist Party and in 1954 from the Norwegian Women's Federation (Norsk Kvinneforbund) which was active until 1999. Both these organizations represented a minority of political workers. For many years the organization was concerned mainly with better living conditions for working-class families and increasing the acceptance of housewives in society at large. From the late 1960s, the focus turned to gender equality at work and in politics. As international discussion developed on whether women's organizations should continue in their own right or as part of an integrated party approach, in Norway it was decided to bring the movement closer to party priorities. In 2005, the organization was dissolved and replaced with a women's network with the Labour Party. Key figures Important figures in the organization over the years include Gunhild Ziener (1868‚Äì1937), Martha Tyn√¶s (1870‚Äì1930), Hanna Adolfsen (1872‚Äì1926), Thina Thorleifsen (1885‚Äì1959), Johanne Reutz Gjermoe (1896‚Äì1989), Aase Lion√¶s (1907‚Äì1999), Rakel Seweriin (1906‚Äì1995), Aase Bjerkholt (1915‚Äì2012) and Sylvia Brustad (born 1966).

Ivy Williams was the first woman to be called to the Bar in 1922. Helena Normanton was the first woman law student and first woman barrister to practice in 1922. Carrie Morrison became the first women solicitor. Auvergne Doherty was the first woman from Western Australia to be called to the English Bar. Doherty was not the first Australian woman to enter the legal profession; this title went to Flos Greig, who was admitted in August 1905. The next Western Australian woman called to the Bar was Alice Mary Cummins, in 1930. It was not until 1975 that the first woman, Valerie French, signed the Bar Roll and practised as a barrister in Western Australia. In Western Australia, when one signs on to only practice as a Barrister, you sign the Bar Roll. That means that women did practice before this date but not specifically as barristers. Auvergne Doherty did not pursue a career in law. Instead, it is noted that she became a secretary for the British Drama League before returning to Perth in 1930 when she took over her father's business.Obituary for Miss Auvergne Doherty, The Times (London, England), Thursday 19 January 1961 On Auvergne's gravestone BLL, 1922 is written. Her call and admission were widely reported in British and Australian newspapers at the time but she is not considered Perth's first woman lawyer. The omission of Doherty as one of the 'firsts' could be because she did not practise law either in England or Western Australia and her story is not well-known.Byrne, G.

Charlotte Coleman, PhD Candidate at St Mary's University, argues that Auvergne could not practise because of her family's declining financial circumstances and argues that Doherty‚Äôs biography is important because it evidences how vital it was to have the necessary financial means and networks to be able to forget a career at the Bar. It was precisely the lack of these factors that impeded Doherty to fulfil her career as a barrister.Charlotte Coleman (2019) Thwarted ambitions: the biography of Auvergne Doherty, an aspiring female barrister, Women's History Review, DOI: 10.1080/09612025.2019.1702787  See also  * First women lawyers around the world  References  Category:1896 births Category:1964 deaths Category:First women admitted to degrees at Oxford Category:Australian women in business Category:20th-century Australian businesspeople ","title":"Auvergne Doherty"},{"id":"53956330","text":"Peter Petrovich Dolgorukov Prince Peter Petrovich Dolgorukov (Russian - –ü—ë—Ç—Ä –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –î–æ–ª–≥–æ—Ä—É–∫–æ–≤; 1744-1815) was a Russian infantry general.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The breakwater is significant due to its construction, which represents a final stage in the United States Army Corps of Engineers's use of timber crib substructures in pier and breakwater construction. History Beginning in the 1840s, the area around lake Manistee began attracting lumber and mill industries. Although the lake offered a fine natural harbor, access from Lake Michigan was limited due to a series of sand bars. To improve access, in 1854 a new channel was cut across the split of land to the west of Lake Manistee, at the location of the present channel. In 1867, legislation was passed allowing the United States Army Corps of Engineers to improve and maintain the channel, including reconstructing the piers at the entryway. The Manistee area remained an important logging and milling center through the rest of the 19th century, and at the beginning of the 20th century, Manistee was producing upwards of 138,000,000 ft of lumber and 28,000,000 shingles per year, most of which was shipped through the harbor. In 1912, Congress passed the River and Harbor Act, which authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to start work on a series of improvements at Manistee Harbor. These included a series of dredging projects, the shortening of the south pier, and the construction of a 1300-foot south breakwater, with a shore connection about 1,200 ft long. The Corps of Engineers contracted Greiling Brothers Company to construct the breakwater, and work began in May 1913. A number of cribs were put in place through 1916 and the shore connection was completed in 1917/18 by John Ginzel. The project, including construction of the superstructure, was finally completed in 1920. The wood decking of the superstructure was replaced by concrete in 1933. Description The south breakwater at Manistee, Michigan is one of three navigation structures at the mouth of the Manistee harbor which are maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers, the other two being the north and south piers. The south breakwater is 2,485 feet in length, and consists of two substructural components: an outer timber crib breakwater and an inner shore connection. The outer timber crib structure is 1,300 feet long, and consists of a series of timber cribs anchored with timber piles. The shore connection extends for 1,185 feet. and consists of a stone filled causeway substructure formed with walls of overlapped wooden planks and capped with a concrete superstructure.

Life He was the son of the future governor of Riga prince Vladimir Petrovich (1699-1761) and Elena Vasilievna, n√©e Princess Hilkova (died 1763). He entered military service in 1749 and fought in the Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763, being wounded twice. He then fought in the Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774) and the Russo-Turkish War (1787-1792), serving at the battles of Gross-Jegersdorf, Cesme and Ochakov among others. Catherine II of Russia put him in command of a detachment sent in 1763 to support Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, a candidate for the throne of Poland. On 21 April 1773 he became a lieutenant general, in 1787 a lieutenant colonel. He defeated Ottoman troops near Chisinau in 1789 and retired from 1790 to 1793 before commanding a division in Moscow from 1794 to 1795. That post ended in resignation after friction with Platon Zubov. Under Paul I of Russia he was military governor-general of Moscow and commander of the Astrakhan Grenadier Regiment. From 1798 until his final retirement in 1799 he was also a member of the Council at the High Court. After retirement he lived in a large lost house on the Bolshaya Nikitskaya and on his Moscow estate at Petrovskoe-Razumovskoye. He died during a cholera epidemic just after his 90th birthday, surviving all his relatives. He was buried next to his wife in the lower church of the Nikolsko-Arkhangelsk church, near the icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker (Saltykovka microdistrict, Balashikha).

Right one from human intestine showing the evaginated scolex. Cysticercus (pl. cysticerci) is a scientific name given to the young tapeworms (larvae) belonging to the genus Taenia. It is a small, sac-like vesicle resembling a bladder; hence, it is also known as bladder worm. It is filled with fluid, in which the main body of the larva, called scolex (which will eventually form the head of the tapeworm), resides. It normally develops from the eggs, which are ingested by the intermediate hosts, such as pigs and cattle. The tissue infection is called cysticercosis. Inside such hosts, they settle in the muscles. When humans eat raw or undercooked pork or beef that is contaminated with cysticerci, the larvae grow into adult worms inside the intestine. Under certain circumstances, specifically for the pork tapeworm, the eggs can be accidentally eaten by humans through contaminated foodstuffs. In such case, the eggs hatch inside the body, generally moving to muscles as well as inside the brain. Such brain infection can lead to a serious medical condition called neurocysticercosis. This disease is the leading cause of acquired epilepsy. Discovery and naming system Cysticercus was discovered in the late 17th century CE as a parasitic bladder. It was believed to be a different organism from the adult tapeworm (Taenia solium), but still closely related to tapeworms for their similar-looking scolices. Hence, it was given a proper scientific name Taenia cellulosae in 1800 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin. At the same time, another German, Johann Zeder, had created a new genus Cysticercosis for a dog tapeworm. This genus was accepted for all bladder worms of Taenia. It became a tradition to refer to the larva of Taenia solium as Cysticercus cellulosae, that of beef tapeworm (T. saginata) as Cysticercus bovis, that of sheep tapeworm (T. ovis) as Cysticercus ovis, that of ruminant tapeworm (T. krabbei) as Cysticercus tarandi, and that of the dog tapeworm (T. crassiceps) as Cysticercus longicollis. Though this system of naming is now scientifically unacceptable, it is still widely used, particularly for description of the infections by the different species. Structure Resected gross specimen of cysicercus from the human brain, (a) and photomicrograph of hematoxylin and eosin stained section, (b) cysticercus cellulosae with an undulating bladder wall and scolex. Three suckers along with rows of hooklets (arrow) can be identified on the scolex (√ó200, original magnification) A cysticercus is a bladder-like transparent vesicle. It is composed of two main parts: the vesicular wall and a scolex. The vesicular wall is a complex structure made up of three distinct layers. The outermost is a smooth and undifferentiated layer called cuticular mantle. The middle is composed of cells that resemble epithelial cells. The innermost is made up of muscle and other fibres. Inside the vesicular wall is an invaginated (facing inward) scolex. The scolex contains suckers and hooks, and a neck attached to a rudimentary body segment. Pathogenicity In the normal lifecycle of Taenia, cysticerci develop in the muscles of the intermediate hosts such as pigs, cattle, and sheep. In these animals, they do not cause severe symptoms. They are transmitted to humans when their infected meats are eaten. However, T. solium is unusual because its cysticerci can develop in humans. Due to accidental consumption of the eggs from contaminated foodstuffs, cycticerci in humans produce clinical symptoms. Thus, humans are accidental intermediate hosts.

His designs include the forts at Pontarlier and Fort-Dauphin in Queyras. Life =Early life= He was the son of a lawyer who also wrote several short works on ancient custom of the Franche-Comt√©. Jean Claude was born in Besan√ßon and was originally intended for a career in the church ‚Äì he was sent to view a parish to win him round to this career, but he was keener on an army career, drawing and mapping fortifications instead of studying Latin. When someone was sent to draw his portrait for his parents, he opted to be shown in the dress of an engineer not a clergyman and his father agreed to support his choice of career. He studied at the √âcole royale du g√©nie de M√©zi√®res in 1754 and was made an engineer-in-ordinary the following year, fighting with distinction in the Seven Years' War, particularly in the defence of Hesse-Kassel in 1761. =Mapping and Gibraltar= In 1774 he was charged with mapping the southern Alps, Nicolas-Alexandre et Olivier-Joseph, \\"Une autre histoire des Alpes\\" : Ascensions oubli√©es des officiers g√©ographes, chef-d‚Äô≈ìuvre cartographique m√©connu, aquarell√©es, dessin√©es au 1/14 400e. the Jura and the Vosges. To speed up his work he invented a new form of ink wash painting with only one brush. http://dossiersinventaire.regionpaca.fr/gertrude- diffusion/recherche/globale?texte=Le+Michaud+d%27Ar√ßon++Jean+Claude+El√©onore In 1774 and 1775 he got into a debate with comte de Guibert over ordre profond versus ordre mince and ended up publishing two pamphlets entitled Correspondance sur l‚Äôart militaire which (as with all his writings) showed many new engineering ideas but also several neologisms and mistakes. The attack on the floating batteries at Gibraltar. Attached to marshal Broglie's force in 1780, he looked for ways to win the siege of Gibraltar. Attacking by land was impossible and so d‚ÄôAr√ßon began designing \\"unsinkable and fire-proof batteries\\" intended to breakthrough from the coast in tandem with other batteries advancing the British rear from inland. These would have strong thick wooden armour and water pumped around them to avoid fire breaking out, whilst old cables would also deaden the fall of enemy shot and their ballast would counterbalance the guns' weight. They would also be supported by ships of the line and bomb ships, who would try to draw away and split up the enemy fire. Five machines with two rows of batteries and a single row of five batteries would make up a total of 150 guns. The Spanish enthusiastically received the proposal and D'Arcon sailed close to shore under enemy fire in a skiff to get more accurate calculations and intelligence. The attack took place on 13 September 1782 and was a complete failure. According to the Biographie Universelle (Michaud, 1843) some of its officers had the \\"evident intention of making [the attempt] fail\\" ‚Äì two of them set off but eight followed too far behind, meaning that the first two drew all the enemy fire. Instead of having these ten ships retire to rejoin the rest of the force, orders were given to set fire to all ten to avoid them falling into enemy hands. This \\"reduced General d'Arcon to despair, and he was deeply resentful of the failure for the rest of his life\\", printing a vindication in 1783 under the title \\"M√©moires pour servir √† l‚Äôhistoire du si√®ge de Gibraltar, par l‚Äôauteur des batteries flottantes\\". Jealousy between the Spanish and French officers had caused the plan to fail but the British governor of Gibraltar, George Eliott, praised D'Arcon. =French Revolution= He wrote and published an article on backward-firing batteries and on the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition he initially fought in the Army of the North under Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez before being promoted to mar√©chal de camp on 13 June 1791. The Committee of Public Safety made him a member of the military committee charged with the direction of the war. He was sent on a reconnaissance mission to Mont Saint-Bernard in 1793, but there he was denounced and forced to retire to Saint-Germain, where he drew up a plan for a French invasion of Holland. He then became a divisional general and he and Pichegru successfully captured the fortress at Breda in January 1795, though that campaign damaged his health and forced him to leave active service. =Academia and death= In February 1795 he became professor of fortification at the √âcole centrale des travaux publics, where he presented it as a combination of other sciences with important economic and political implications. Printed by order of the government, his last work was Consid√©rations militaires et politiques sur les fortifications, summarizing all his previous work. He was appointed to the S√©nat conservateur in 1799 by Bonaparte during the latter's time as First Consul, but died at the ch√¢teau de la Tuilerie in aged 67 the following year.

He is a world leading expert on cross-linguistic differences in reading. His research on reading in Hebrew has changed the prevalent anglocentric theoretical perspectives of reading research, and has changed the educational system of Israel and its methods of teaching reading.  Education  Ram Frost received his B.A in Psychology in 1980, his M.A. in 1983, and his Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology in 1986, all at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was a post-doctoral fellow at Haskins Laboratories 1986‚Äì1988, and a Fulbright fellow 1993‚Äì1994.  Scientific contributions  Frost‚Äôs main contributions have been in the area of reading, visual word recognition, and statistical learning. He is mostly known for his landmark theoretical papers that had substantial impact on the field, offering novel and counter-intuitive perspectives. His Orthographic Depth Hypothesis Katz, L. & Frost, R. (1992). Reading in different orthographies: the orthographic depth hypothesis. In: R. Frost, & L. Katz (Eds.). Orthography, Phonology, Morphology, and Meaning. (pp. 67-84). In Advances in Psychology, Holland: Elsevier. has argued, contrary to the then mainstream position, that spelling-to-sound correspondence leads to significant differences in reading strategies. His Strong Phonological Theory of Visual Word Recognition Frost, R. (1998). \\"Towards a strong phonological theory of visual word recognition: True issues and false trails\\". Psychological Bulletin, 123, 71‚Äì99. has argued that the fast recognition of letter-sounds drives reading in any writing system. His pivotal experimental work on morphological processing in Hebrew using fast presentation techniques Frost, R., Forster, K.I., & Deutsch, A. (1997). \\"What can we learn from the morphology of Hebrew: a masked priming investigation of morphological representation\\". Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory, & Cognition, 23, 829‚Äì856. has shown that the root structure of Semitic languages impact basic visual processing of letters. His research on letter-position coding in Hebrew has led to his recent comprehensive theoretical paper ‚ÄúTowards a Universal Theory of Reading‚Äù,Frost, R. (2012). Towards a universal model of reading. Target article, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 35, 263‚Äì279 arguing that writing systems evolve non-arbitrarily to reflect the language phonological and morphological structure. Therefore, contrary to common assumptions and intuitions, linguistic factors must be taken into account to understand even peripheral visual processing of print. Prof. Frost was Associate Editor of the journal Language and Cognitive Processes (1996-1999) and in 1999 he founded the International Morphological Processing Conference (MORPROC). In recent years Frost has argued for a novel theoretical perspective tying individual sensitivity to regularities in the environment (statistical learning), to assimilating the structural properties of a novel writing system.Frost, R. Siegelman, N, Narkiss, A., & Afek, L. (2013). What predicts successful literacy acquisition in a second language? Psychological Science, 24, 1243-1252.

Her whereabouts remain unknown. Background Charity was a businesswoman who owned a joint venture called Chavid Limited (a combination of her name \\"Charity\\" and her husband's name \\"David\\"), which consisted of a fashion-design business and a restaurant, also located in Abuja. She was a mother of four children, estranged from her husband of 15 years, David Aiyedogbon, and was living in a rented apartment. Besides her business activities, Charity was also active on Facebook prior to her disappearance, where she was popularly known by the name \\"Deepdeal Chacha De Hammer\\" and was a member of a Facebook group \\"FEMALE IN NIGERIA\\" (FIN). According to information from her Facebook friends, her last known update on social media was made on 11 May 2016 in the form of a photograph of herself sitting in a vehicle with the words \\"going on a road trip\\" at about 9:11 AM. Investigations It became apparent that Charity had previously received threats to her safety from some undisclosed individuals in the days before her disappearance. Her friends revealed that the threats prompted her to contract a technician to install CCTV cameras in her apartment. After her disappearance, all attempts to contact her though her mobile phone were unsuccessful. Charity's case was reported to the Gwarimpa Police Division in Abuja. Investigators gained access into her Abuja apartment with the help of her landlady and some security personnel. Further investigations revealed that there was no indication that she had planned to go on any trip, as she had no bag packed and every item in her apartment was in order. A pot of stew was still on the cooker. Investigative efforts to retrieve her call logs revealed that the last call from her phone was made on 9 May, to a number registered to an individual named Rabi Mohammed. The last received call from another number showed the same date. The Federal Capital Territory Police Command arrested some suspects in connection with her disappearance (who were later released), while her vehicle and two mobile phones were recovered. Aftermath A Nigerian lawyer, Emeka Ugwonye, accused Charity's estranged husband David of being involved in her disappearance. However, no concrete evidence could be found to implicate him. David later sued the lawyer for defamation. Some have gone on further to question the professionalism and claims of the lawyer. Charity's eldest daughter, Juliet, received backlash on social media for planning to proceed with her wedding while her mother was recently declared missing. However, the wedding was postponed indefinitely as a result of further controversy following Ugwuonye's claims about her missing mother. Various support groups have emerged to bring justice for Charity. The dismembered corpse of an unidentified woman discovered in Abuja was rumoured to belong to Charity. However, no DNA test has been conducted by the police to confirm her identity. To date, no conclusion has been drawn regarding the dismembered body. Charity is still declared missing.

The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2018. It was released on September 14, 2018, by Momentum Pictures. Plot Del lives alone in a small town after an unspecified apocalyptic event has killed off the human population. Believing he is the last man on Earth, Del has set about leading a peaceful existence in his hometown, living in the library where he used to work and spending the day clearing out people's homes and burying the dead. One night he is awakened by fireworks. The following day he discovers a young woman, named Grace, unconscious in her car having gotten into a drunken car accident. Initially, Del is unwelcoming toward the woman, who follows him around and urges him to let her stay. When the woman decides to leave, Del stops her for a theoretical trial period in case they need each other. Grace is a noisy, erratic presence, but Del reluctantly becomes used to her, feeding her and teaching her his methods for clearing the homes of the dead. When Grace finds a dog, she showers it with love and attention but after the dog bites Del he lets it loose and it runs away. When he admits this to Grace she is furious and reminds him that while he was bitter and alone in his previous life she was loved and happy. A repentant Del shows her his greenhouse and asks her to continue clearing houses with him. On one of her trips to search for houses, Grace comes across a house that hasn't been cleared yet and which Del doesn't want to clear. She realizes that it belongs to Del's family. Grace and Del clean the house and bury Del's mother's body. Afterwards, Grace informs Del that she has something to tell him but instead avoids addressing the topic directly and kisses him. The following morning, Del wakes up in the house Grace has been using and is surprised to hear voices downstairs. He meets two new survivors, Patrick and Violet, who introduce themselves as Grace's parents. It is revealed that there were thousands of survivors of the apocalypse, who have formed a community. Because Del has never left his town, he has not been made aware. Del is upset and leaves but Grace chases him and begs him to keep her with him saying that the couple are not her real parents and that she was paired with them when she reached the survivor's commune in California. Del ignores her and leaves. Patrick visits Del at the library where he urges Del to come with him hinting at different experiments occurring in California that focus on the mind. Soon thereafter, Grace leaves with the couple and Del returns to his solitary lifestyle though he is now wracked with loneliness. No longer capable of living alone, Del abandons his small town and drives to the address Patrick left him, hoping to find Grace. Del sneaks into Grace's home to see her and while there sees she has undergone more behavior modification surgery to erase the lingering trauma caused by the loss of her family. While Del and Grace are trying to escape, Patrick attempts to stop them. He explains that the only way for the human race to move forward is to forget the past and what they all lost. Grace panics and shoots him. Violet is not upset as she still remembers her previous life and the daughter she lost, despite the behavior modification she has been subjected to. Del and Grace find the city populated with disconcertingly happy survivors, all blissfully and willfully ignorant of their past trauma. Del and Grace leave the city with the intent to return to Del's small town. Cast *Peter Dinklage as Del *Elle Fanning as Grace *Paul Giamatti as Patrick *Charlotte Gainsbourg as Violet Production In October 2016, Peter Dinklage and Elle Fanning were attached to star as Del and Grace, respectively. Principal photography was done in New York state, including the towns of Hastings-on-Hudson and Haverstraw. Release The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2018, where it won the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Excellence in Filmmaking. A month later, Momentum Pictures acquired distribution rights to the film. It was released on September 14, 2018. Critical response The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 63% approval rating, based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 6.35/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"I Think We're Alone Now benefits from an absorbing aesthetic and solid work from its leads, although it's still somewhat less than the sum of its post-apocalyptic parts.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 51 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 2 stars out of 5, saying, \\"the emotional investment we make in Del and Grace comes to nothing, as the plot ties up loose ends without a single surprise or a scintilla of genuine emotion.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"It's hard to figure what induced director Reed Morano, who did such a fine job directing the first three episodes of The Handmaid's Tale last season, to take on such a script, one so devoid of surprise, intriguing notions and compelling scenes.\\" Vikram Murthi of The A.V. Club gave the film a \\"C\\" grade, saying, \\"Morano's film wants to examine the emotional consequences of immersing oneself in trauma, but Makowsky's script merely paws at the edges of the idea rather than diving into the knottiness of it.\\" References External links * Category:2018 films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:English- language films Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:Post- apocalyptic films Category:2010s science fiction films Category:Films directed by Reed Morano Category:2018 independent films ","title":"I Think We're Alone Now (film)"},{"id":"53956976","title":"Trotsky Marudu"},{"id":"53956979","title":"Organ Festival of Braga"},{"id":"53956995","text":"The Ven.

History  The station was opened on 8 November 1885 by the North Eastern Railway. It was situated a mile east of station, adjacent to Dockside Road, between junctions with Marsh Road and Works Road. Cargo Fleet was a passenger only station, although there were sidings nearby which handled goods traffic. The 1904 RCH handbook recorded that the sidings served two ironworks, (one that served a brickworks and a wharf) a warrant stores, a timber yard and wharves, a salt works and a wharf. On 4 May 1969 the station was one of many to be reduced to an 'unstaffed halt', which meant that the station was attractive to vandals. By 1972 the windows were boarded up, the brickwork had graffiti all over it, the lamps were smashed and the posters were ripped to the point where only peelings remained. After these buildings were demolished, a small brick shelter was built with electric lighting. Due to the low population of Cargo Fleet (in 1911 it was estimated to have only 682 residents) and the closure of nearby factories on the line, there was very little passenger demand. British Rail realised that the station would require an outlay of ¬£60,000 if it remained open, so it closed completely on 22 January 1990.

It was part of the Pleistocene Trinil Fauna of Java. Other animals of this Faunal assemblage were Bos palaesondaicus, the Indian muntjak (Muntiacus muntjak), Bubalus palaeokerabau, the Dubois santeng and Stegodon trigonocephalus. Other predators of the Trinil Fauna were the Trinil tiger (Panthera tigris trinilensis) and the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis).Christine Hertler/ Yan Rizal (2005): Excursion guide to the Pleistocene Hominid Sites in Central and East Java, Johann Wolfgang Geothe-Universit√§t, Frankfurt am Main, Germany/ ITB, Bandung, Indonesia It has been estimated that Mececyon trinilensis hunted prey of 1 kg to 10 kg, preferably 5 kg in size. However this number could vary, because it is yet unknown if the Mececyon trinilensis hunted in packs, or if carrion left over by the Trinil tiger influenced its feeding habits.  Evolution  Mececyon trinilensis probably evolved from Xenocyon lycanoides, like the larger Indonesian Merriam's dog (Megacyon merriami) and the Sardinian dhole (Cynotherium sardous). Its closest living relatives are the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and the dhole (Cuon alpinus). The Trinil dog went extinct in the course of the Pleistocene.

It states that for any deterministic process of collective decision, at least one of the following three properties must hold: # The process is dictatorial, i.e. there exists a distinguished agent who can impose the outcome; # The process limits the possible outcomes to two options only; # The process is open to strategic voting: once an agent has identified their preferences, it is possible that they have no action at their disposal that best defends these preferences irrespective of the other agents' actions. A corollary of this theorem is Gibbard‚ÄìSatterthwaite theorem about voting rules. The main difference between the two is that Gibbard‚ÄìSatterthwaite theorem is limited to ranked (ordinal) voting rules: a voter's action consists in giving a preference ranking over the available options. Gibbard's theorem is more general and considers processes of collective decision that may not be ordinal: for example, voting systems where voters assign grades to candidates. Gibbard's theorem can be proven using Arrow's impossibility theorem. Gibbard's theorem is itself generalized by Gibbard's 1978 theorem and Hylland's theorem, which extend these results to non-deterministic processes, i.e. where the outcome may not only depend on the agents' actions but may also involve an element of chance.  Overview  Consider some voters 1, 2 and 3 who wish to select an option among three alternatives: a, b and c. Assume they use approval voting: each voter assigns to each candidate the grade 1 (approval) or 0 (disapproval). For example, (1, 1, 0) is an authorized ballot: it means that the voter approves of candidates a and b but disapproves of candidate c. Once the ballots are collected, the candidate with highest total grade is declared the winner. Ties between candidates are broken by alphabetical order: for example, if there is a tie between candidates a and b, then a wins. Assume that voter 1 prefers alternative a, then b and then c. Which ballot will best defend her opinions? For example, consider the two following situations. * If the two other voters respectively cast ballots (0, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 1), then voter 1 has only one ballot that leads to the election of her favorite alternative a : (1, 0, 0). * However, if we assume instead that the two other voters respectively cast ballots (0, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1), then voter 1 should not vote (1, 0, 0) because it makes c win; she should rather vote (1, 1, 0), which makes b win. To sum up, voter 1 faces a strategic voting dilemma: depending on the ballots that the other voters will cast, (1, 0, 0) or (1, 1, 0) can be a ballot that best defends her opinions. We then say that approval voting is not straightforward : once the voter has identified her own preferences, she does not have a ballot at her disposal that best defends her opinions in all situations. Gibbard's theorem states that a deterministic process of collective decision cannot be straightforward, except possibly in two cases: if there is a distinguished agent who has a dictatorial power, or if the process limits the outcome to two possible options only.  Formal statement  Let \\\\mathcal{A} be the set of alternatives, which can also be called candidates in a context of voting. Let \\\\mathcal{N} = \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\\\\\} be the set of agents, which can also be called players or voters, depending on the context of application. For each agent i, let \\\\mathcal{S}_i be a set that represents the available strategies for agent i; assume that \\\\mathcal{S}_i is finite. Let g be a function that, to each n-tuple of strategies (s_1, \\\\ldots, s_n) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}_1 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times \\\\mathcal{S}_n, maps an alternative. The function g is called a game form. In other words, a game form is essentially defined like an n-player game, but with no utilities associated to the possible outcomes: it describes the procedure only, without specifying a priori the gain that each agent would get from each outcome. We say that g is straightforward if and only if for any agent i and for any strict weak order P_i over the alternatives, there exists a strategy s_i^*(P_i) that is dominant for agent i when she has preferences P_i: there is no profile of strategies for the other agents such that another strategy s_i, different from s_i^*(P_i), would lead to a strictly better outcome (in the sense of P_i). This property is desirable for a democratic decision process: it means that once the agent i has identified her own preferences P_i, she can choose a strategy s_i^*(P_i) that best defends her preferences, with no need to know or guess the strategies chosen by the other agents. We let \\\\mathcal{S} = \\\\mathcal{S}_1 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times \\\\mathcal{S}_n and denote by g(\\\\mathcal{S}) the range of g, i.e. the set of the possible outcomes of the game form. For example, we say that g has at least 3 possible outcomes if and only if the cardinality of g(\\\\mathcal{S}) is 3 or more. Since the strategy sets are finite, g(\\\\mathcal{S}) is finite also; thus, even if the set of alternatives \\\\mathcal{A} is not assumed to be finite, the subset of possible outcomes g(\\\\mathcal{S}) is necessarily so. We say that g is dictatorial if and only if there exists an agent i who is a dictator, in the sense that for any possible outcome a \\\\in g(\\\\mathcal{S}), agent i has a strategy at her disposal that ensures that the result is a, whatever the strategies chosen by the other agents.  Examples  = Serial dictatorship = We assume that each voter communicates a strict weak order over the candidates. The serial dictatorship is defined as follows. If voter 1 has a unique most-liked candidate, then this candidate is elected. Otherwise, possible outcomes are restricted to his ex- aequo most-liked candidates and the other candidates are eliminated. Then voter 2's ballot is examined: if he has a unique best-liked candidate among the non-eliminated ones, then this candidate is elected. Otherwise, the list of possible outcomes is reduced again, etc. If there is still several non- eliminated candidates after all ballots have been examined, then an arbitrary tie-breaking rule is used. This game form is straightforward: whatever the preferences of a voter, he has a dominant strategy that consists in declaring his sincere preference order. It is also dictatorial, and its dictator is voter 1: if his wishes to see candidate a elected, then he just has to communicate a preference order where a is the unique most-liked candidate. = Simple majority vote = If there are only 2 possible outcomes, a game form may be straightforward and not dictatorial. For example, it is the case of the simple majority vote: each voter casts a ballot for her most-liked alternative (among the two possible outcomes), and the alternative with most votes is declared the winner. This game form is straightforward because it is always optimal to vote for one's most-liked alternative (unless one is indifferent between them). However, it is clearly not dictatorial. Many other game forms are straightforward and not dictatorial: for example, assume that the alternative a wins if it gets two thirds of the votes, and b wins otherwise. = A game form showing that the converse does not hold = Consider the following game form. Voter 1 can vote for a candidate of her choice, or she can abstain. In the first case, the specified candidate is automatically elected. Otherwise, the other voters use a classic voting rule, for example the Borda count. This game form is clearly dictatorial, because voter 1 can impose the result. However, it is not straightforward: the other voters face the same issue of strategic voting as in the usual Borda count. Thus, Gibbard's theorem is an implication and not an equivalence.

Maruthakasi (13 February 1920 ‚Äì 29 November 1989) was a Tamil poet and film lyricist who wrote mainly in the Tamil language. He penned more than 4000 lyrics in more than 250 Tamil films. He was born in a heritage family from Udayar (caste) community. Early life Born in Melakudikadu in Tiruchirappalli district on 13 February 1920 to parents Ayyamperumal udayar and Milagayi Ammal, he had his primary education in the local village school. He had his higher education at Government College, Kumbakonam. After college, he wrote lyrics for the dramas staged by Devi Nadaga Sabha and to Mandirikumari a drama written by M. Karunanidhi. He also wrote lyrics for the drama company owned by Ka. Mu. Sheriff. The songs for the dramas were composed by Thiruchi Loganathan. Later, he joined as an assistant to Rajagopala Iyer, brother of Papanasam Sivan. Tamil Film Lyricist In 1949, Modern Theatres was producing a Tamil film. G. Ramanathan was the composer. During the song recording rehearsals, Thiruchi Loganathan sang a song penned by Maruthakasi. Producer T. R. Sundaram appreciated the meaning of the lyrics and gave a chance to Maruthakasi in the film. Pen Enum Maayap Peyaam ... Poi Maadharai Yen Manam Naadumo is the first film lyric penned by Maruthakasi and the film Mayavathi released in 1949. Since then he has written more than 4000 lyrics for more than 250 Tamil films. He had the ability to write lyrics to an already set tune. As such, he has penned lyrics for many films dubbed from other language films. When Modern Theatres decided to produce Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum in 1956, T. R. Sundaram decided to use the same tunes set for the Hindi film of the same name. Udumalai Narayana Kavi was called to write the lyrics. But he declined saying that he will write lyrics for fresh tunes and recommended Maruthakasi. Maruthakasi wrote 9 songs for the set tunes. One of his greatest hits, Neelavanna Kanna Vaadaa from the film (Mangaiyar Thilakam was first assigned to Kannadasan. But film-maker L. V. Prasad was not impressed by that song. He asked Maruthakasi to write the song and it became a big hit. During the earlier decades of Tamil films, songs were written as per old Tamil literature. Maruthakasi is a foremost lyricist who started writing lyrics that could be understood by the common man. Many of his lyrics have taken root in the hearts of audience. *Neelavanna Kanna Vaadaa (Mangaiyar Thilakam ‚Äì 1955) *Sathiyame Latchiyamaayi Kollada (Neelamalai Thirudan ‚Äì 1957) *Mullai Malar Mele (Uthama Puthiran ‚Äì 1958) *Yer Munaikku Ner Inge Edhuvumeyille (Pillai Kani Amudhu ‚Äì 1958) *Sirippu Idhan Sirappai (Raja Rani ‚Äì 1956) are some of his songs that still remain evergreen among Tamil film music lovers. Personal life He married Dhanakodi Ammal in 1940. The couple have 6 sons and 3 daughters. He encouraged young persons who were looking for a career in Tamil films. *When Vaali was looking for opportunities in the early sixties, he was given a chance to write a song for the film Nallavan Vazhvan. The recording of the song Sirikindral inru sirikindral was being postponed several times for various reasons. The producers thought the 'omen' was not good and asked Maruthakasi to write a song.

The song was a hit. *When Modern Theatres in Salem produced Paasavalai in 1956, they invited Maruthakasi to write the lyrics. But Maruthakasi was busy in Chennai. He recommended Pattukkottai Kalyanasundaram for writing the lyrics. *In 1954 he recommended T. M. Soundararajan as a playback singer for the film Thookku Thookki to music director G. Ramanathan. T. M. Soundararajan went on to become a legend in Tamil film music. After 1960s most of the producers sought Kannadasan as lyricist for their films. Maruthakasi did not get much opportunities. He tried to produce films but sustained losses so he returned to his village. M. G. Ramachandran called him back to Chennai and made him to write lyrics for all films produced by Devar films. Maruthakasi wrote lyrics for films produced by K. S. Gopalakrishnan. Works His works have been made public by the State government of Tamil Nadu. Death He died on 29 November 1989.

Open conflict between the groups also took place exactly one year earlier, before a ceasefire was implemented. Background Conflict On 28 April, sounds of intense fighting echoed through several suburbs of Eastern Ghouta, with Jaysh al-Islam fighters assaulting Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Rahman Legion forces. Jaysh al-Islam claimed that this happened due to these rebel groups preventing their convoys from reinforcing the Qaboun suburb. On the same day, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that 40 rebel fighters from all sides were killed in the clashes, including a HTS Emir in Arbin. On 29 April, masked gunmen stormed a hospital operated by M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res in Hazzeh and forced the MSF to suspend activities in the area. On 30 April, Jaysh al-Islam announced that they were waging a full-scale operation against HTS and warned fighters belonging to the Rahman Legion to not support them, as of that day 95 people have been killed during the infighting, according to SOHR. However, the same day, HTS combatants allied with the Rahman Legion and Ahrar al-Sham stormed, and after intense clashes, captured the towns of Jisrin and Hazzeh. On the same day, around 3,000 residents in Arbin demonstrated against the rebel infighting. Jaysh al-Islam fighters opened fire on the protesters, killing a child and injuring 14 others. During the first day of May, fighters of Jaysh al-Islam entered the town of Zamalka, engaging in fierce clashes with forces of the Rahman Legion and HTS. By the same day, more than 120 people were killed in the fighting. On 3 May, Jaysh al-Islam fighters recaptured the town of Beit Sawa from Faylaq al-Rahman, during the same day they also made a deal with the Syrian Army, according to which, 51 aid convoys entered Douma in exchange for Jaysh al-Islam release of hundreds predominantly Alawite citizens of Syria captured by the group throughout the years. On 4 May, HTS and the Rahman Legion recaptured large parts of Arbin from Jaysh al-Islam. The next day, Jaysh al-Islam declared an end to its combat operations against HTS. On 8 May, Jaysh al-Islam once again declared war on HTS and the Rahman Legion, with clashes resuming. Also on 8 May 2017, Glory Brigades rejoined the Rahman Legion after the Rahman Legion surrounded their headquarters in Hammouriyah two days ago. On 11 May, the Rahman Legion raided the headquarters of Ahrar al-Sham in Arbin and captured 15 of their fighters. This was followed by clashes. On the same day, the Fajr al-Umma Brigade announced its accession into Ahrar al-Sham. Two days later, a fighter of the Rahman Legion attacked a medical center in Maliha and opened fire on the people inside. A medical worker was shot and injured. On 15 May, Jaysh al-Islam fighters stormed Tahrir al-Sham and Faylaq al-Rahman bases in Beit Sawa and Al-Asha'ari setting off intense firefights. The same day, Jaysh al-Islam also made progress against Faylaq al-Rahman in the outskirts of Hamouriyah, with numerous casualties on both sides. On 30 May, a new round of clashes ensued between the warring factions as Jaysh al-Islam captured the Ashari farms from HTS and the Rahman Legion. The next day, Jaysh al-Islam attempted to fully secure the Ashari area, but a counter-attack by the Rahman Legion forced Jaysh al-Islam to retreat from the Ashari farms. Pro-government media claimed that Jaysh al- Islam resorted to deploying child fighters against rival groups in Eastern Ghouta pocket, with at least two fighters under 16 years of age being killed during the clashes at Ashari farms. Aftermath On 6 June, the Syrian Army managed to cut off Tall Farzat-al-Nashabiyah supply route for Jaysh al-Islam, thus further complicating their situation. A month later, Jaysh al-Islam decided to use a situation created by the Syrian Army offensive in Jobar and Ayn Tarma, which resulted in Faylaq al-Rahman and Tahrir al-Sham diverting their fighters to fight the Syrian Army, to storm the positions of aforementioned rebel groups in the towns of Beit Sawa and Al-Ashari. On 22 July 2017, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that a de-escalation agreement had been signed for Eastern Ghouta in Cairo following a talks between Russian military officials and Jaish al Islam.No less than 534 Barrel Bombs in October 2017, Syrian Network for Human Rights, 9 November 2017 On 6 August 2017, 120 Ahrar al-Sham fighters in Arbin defected to the Rahman Legion after internal disputes. Ahrar al-Sham accused the Rahman Legion of seizing their weapons, while the Rahman Legion accused Ahrar al-Sham of their attempt to implement their \\"failed\\" experience from northern Syria in eastern Ghouta. Tahrir al-Sham reportedly sided with Ahrar al-Sham against the Sham Legion during the clashes. A ceasefire agreement between the Rahman Legion and Ahrar al-Sham was implemented on 9 August. On 16 August 16, a Failaq al Rahman representative and a Russian representative signed an agreement in Geneva city that established Failaq al Rahman‚Äôs inclusion in the de-escalation zone in Eastern Ghouta, to come into effect at 21:00 on 18 August. SOHR reported that government bombing resumed in Eastern Ghouta on 27 September 2017.More casualties raise the death toll to 4 persons after the first bombing on the Eastern Ghouta after stopping lasted for two months, SOHR, 27 September 2017 In February 2018, the Syrian army launched an operation to dislodge rebels from the area. In early March 2018, the Syrian army had captured 59% of the Eastern Ghouta pocket. On 7 April 2018, at least 48 people were reportedly killed in a chemical attack in Douma, which resulted in an armed response from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom.On 14 April 2018, the Syrian Army officially declared Eastern Ghouta to be free of militants, securing it under government control.

Career Berard started his college career as a goaltender for Providence in 1988. He spent four years as a backup for the Friars, playing in only 5 games before graduating with a degree in business marketing. He remained at the college level by taking an assistant coaching position with Colby, staying with the program for two years before returning to his alma mater. Berard was an assistant for the Friars for two more seasons and accepted a similar post from Lake Superior State starting in 1996. Two years later he was back in Providence for a third time but decided to remain with the Friars for an extended period. From 1998 through 2011 he was an assistant coach under Paul Pooley and Tim Army, but he also served as the teams recruiting coordinator for seven seasons, was promoted to an associate coach from 2003 through 2005 and was USA Hockey's director of player development for the New England region from 2003 to 2008. When Tim Army was replaced by Nate Leaman in 2011 Berard was replaced and he became an assistant with Connecticut but in just over a year he suddenly found himself as the interim head coach for the Huskies when Bruce Marshall took a medical leave of absence. Berard remained behind the bench for Connecticut for the remainder of the season, compiling a record of 19‚Äì10‚Äì3 and getting the Huskies into a 3rd place finish in the conference. His efforts were not enough, however, and Connecticut opted to name Mike Cavanaugh as the bench boss for the next season. Berard found himself back with the Friars yet again the next season as the Director of Hockey Operations but after only one year at that post he left to receive his first full-time head coaching post with Holy Cross. In his short time with the Crusaders Berard has seen a moderate amount of success, recording three consecutive double-digit win seasons but only one of them was above .500.

It is of interest as a type of post-quantum cryptography. So far, hash-based cryptography is limited to digital signatures schemes such as the Merkle signature scheme. Hash-based signature schemes combine a one-time signature scheme with a Merkle tree structure. Since a one-time signature scheme key can only sign a single message securely, it is practical to combine many such keys within a single, larger structure. A Merkle tree structure is used to this end. In this hierarchical data structure, a hash function and concatenation are used repeatedly to compute tree nodes. Lamport signatures are an example of a one- time signature scheme that can be combined with a Merkle tree structure. In 2019, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology announced its intention to promulgate standards for stateful hash-based cryptography based on the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) and Leighton-Micali Signatures (LMS), which are applicable in different circumstances. History Leslie Lamport invented hash-based signatures in 1979. The XMSS (eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme) and SPHINCS hash-based signature schemes were introduced in 2011 and 2015, respectively. XMSS was developed by a team of researchers under the direction of Johannes Buchmann and is based both on Merkle's seminal scheme and on the 2007 Generalized Merkle Signature Scheme (GMSS). A multi- tree variant of XMSS, XMSSMT, was described in 2013. One-time signature schemes Hash-based signature schemes use one-time signature schemes as their building block. A given one-time signing key can only be used to sign a single message securely. Indeed, signatures reveal part of the signing key. The security of (hash-based) one-time signature schemes relies exclusively on the security of an underlying hash function. Commonly used one-time signature schemes include the Lamport-Diffie scheme, the Winternitz scheme and its improvements, such as the W-OTS+ scheme. Unlike the seminal Lamport-Diffie scheme, the Winternitz scheme and variants can sign many bits at once. The number of bits to be signed at once is determined by a value: the Winternitz parameter. The existence of this parameter provides a trade-off between size and speed. Large values of the Winternitz parameter yield short signatures and keys, at the price of slower signing and verifying. In practice, a typical value for this parameter is 16. In the case of stateless hash-based signatures, few-time signature schemes are used. Such schemes allow security to decrease gradually in case a few-time key is used more than once. HORST is an example of a few-time signature scheme. Combining many one-time key pairs into a hash-based signature scheme The central idea of hash-based signature schemes is to combine a larger number of one-time key pairs into a single structure to obtain a practical way of signing more than once (yet a limited number of times). This is done using a Merkle tree structure, with possible variations. One public and one private key are constructed from the numerous public and private keys of the underlying one-time scheme. The global public key is the single node at the very top of the Merkle tree. Its value is an output of the selected hash function, so a typical public key size is 32 bytes. The validity of this global public key is related to the validity of a given one-time public key using a sequence of tree nodes. This sequence is called the authentication path. It is stored as part of the signature, and allows a verifier to reconstruct the node path between those two public keys. The global private key is generally handled using a pseudo-random number generator. It is then sufficient to store a seed value. One-time secret keys are derived successively from the seed value using the generator. With this approach, the global private key is also very small, e.g. typically 32 bytes. The problem of tree traversal is critical to signing performance. Increasingly efficient approaches have been introduced, dramatically speeding up signing time. Some hash-based signature schemes use multiple layers of tree, offering faster signing at the price of larger signatures. In such schemes, only the lowest layer of trees is used to sign messages, while all other trees sign root values of lower trees. The Naor-Yung workM. Naor, M. Yung. \\"Universal One-Way Hash Functions and their Cryptographic Applications\\". STOC 1989. shows the pattern by which to transfer a limited time signature of the Merkle type family into an unlimited (regular) signature scheme. Properties of hash-based signature schemes Hash-based signature schemes rely on security assumptions about the underlying hash function, but any hash function fulfilling these assumptions can be used. As a consequence, each adequate hash function yields a different corresponding hash-based signature scheme. Even if a given hash function becomes insecure, it is sufficient to replace it by a different, secure one to obtain a secure instantiation of the hash-based signature scheme under consideration. Some hash-based signature schemes (such as XMSS with pseudorandom key generation) are forward secure, meaning that previous signatures remain valid if a secret key is compromised. The minimality of security assumptions is another characteristic of hash-based signature schemes. Generally, these schemes only require a secure (for instance in the sense of second preimage resistance) cryptographic hash function to guarantee the overall security of the scheme. This kind of assumption is necessary for any digital signature scheme; however, other signature schemes require additional security assumptions, which is not the case here. Because of their reliance on an underlying one-time signature scheme, hash-based signature schemes can only sign a fixed number of messages securely. In the case of the Merkle and XMSS schemes, a maximum of 2^h messages can be signed securely, with h the total Merkle tree height. Examples of hash-based signature schemes Since Merkle's initial scheme, numerous hash-based signature schemes with performance improvements have been introduced. Recent ones include the XMSS, the Leighton-Micali (LMS), the SPHINCS and the BPQS schemes. Most hash-based signature schemes are stateful, meaning that signing requires updating the secret key, unlike conventional digital signature schemes. For stateful hash-based signature schemes, signing requires keeping state of the used one-time keys and making sure they are never reused. The XMSS, LMS and BPQS schemes are stateful, while the SPHINCS scheme is stateless. SPHINCS signatures are larger than XMSS, LMS signatures, while BPQS has been designed specifically for blockchain systems. Additionally to the WOTS+ one-time signature scheme, SPHINCS also uses a few-time (hash- based) signature scheme called HORST. HORST is an improvement of an older few- time signature scheme, HORS (Hash to Obtain Random Subset). The stateful hash- based schemes XMSS and XMSSMT are specified in RFC 8391 (XMSS: eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme) . Leighton-Micali Hash-Based Signatures are specified in RFC 8554. Practical improvements have been proposed in the literature that alleviate the concerns introduced by stateful schemes. Hash functions appropriate for these schemes include SHA-2, SHA-3 and BLAKE. Implementations Unlike other popular blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies that use already NIST standardized Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithms (ECDSA), The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is the first open source network to implement eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme. In contrast to traditional ECDSA signatures, this stateful signature scheme is provably resistant to a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor‚Äôs algorithm. The XMSS, GMSS and SPHINCS schemes are available in the Java Bouncy Castle cryptographic APIs. SPHINCS is implemented in the SUPERCOP benchmarking toolkit. Optimised and unoptimised reference implementations of the XMSS RFC exist. The LMS scheme has been implemented in Python and in C following its Internet-Draft. References * T.

It includes more broad policy movements, such as the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Food justice recognizes the food system as \\"a racial project and problematizes the influence of race and class on the production, distribution and consumption of food\\". This encompasses farm labor work, land disputes, issues of status and class, environmental justice, public politics, and advocacy. Food justice is closely connected to food sovereignty, which critiques \\"structural barriers communities of color face to accessing local and organic foods\\" that are largely due to institutional racism and the effect it has on economic equality. It is argued that lack of access to good food is both a cause and a symptom of the structural inequalities that divide society. A possible solution presented for poor areas includes community gardens, fairness for food workers, and a national food policy. https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/fixing-food Background The modern Food Justice movement grew out of the Community Food Security Coalition (CFSC) in 1996, which sought to provide affordable, culturally appropriate, healthy food to Americans. A shortcoming of this group, was that it was composed entirely of white Americans, and accepted little input from residents of food insecure areas which the CFSC was trying to help. It emphasized the consumption of local and fresh fruits and vegetables, and removed race from the conversation. Director of Nuestras Raices Daniel Ross points out that: > ‚Ä¶food security cannot be divorced from the issues of concern to communities > [‚Ä¶] food and agriculture lends itself to addressing [racism and power > imbalances] because food is so central to communities and, if you had > working communities, you'd have justice and equality. [‚Ä¶] At the heart is > the element of justice. Other scholars who have done research in food justice and related topics include Monica M. White whose research is focused on the primarily black community in Detroit. In her article Sisters of the Soil: Urban Gardening as Resistance in Detroit, she discusses the work of the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network (DBCFSN) that uses farming as a way to alleviate food insecurity and make political statements. White cites the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 2005-2006 to point out that 52.9% of black women are obese, compared to 37.2% of black men and 32.9% of white women due to phenomena like food deserts and food insecurity. Because the socioeconomic status of black communities in Detroit are a huge part of the food insecurity issues black communities face, this serves as an example for the inseparability of food justice movements and social reform.White, Monica M. ‚ÄúSisters of the Soil: Urban Gardening as Resistance in Detroit.‚Äù Race/Ethnicity: Multidisciplinary Global Contexts, vol. 5, no. 1, 2011, pp. 13‚Äì28.

Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: \\"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medial care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.\\" The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations states that the right to food is \\"The right to feed oneself in dignity. It is the right to have continuous access to the resources that will enable you to produce, earn or purchase enough food to not only prevent hunger, but also to ensure health and well-being. The right to food only rarely means that a person has the right to free handouts.\\" Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Right to Food Unit.

They are a group of victims of the armed conflict and have been using grassroots for twenty years to create peace.

Many Colombians are unaware of the peace movement. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) which is a part of USDA's Research, Education, and Economics mission area (REE), NIFA is an agency that uses federal funding in order to address agricultural and food justice related issues that impact people's daily lives. This is a collaborative effort that uses scientists and research in order to locate and find solutions to issues in the agricultural chain. They use science-policy decision making, something to keep in mind when asking what problems are being fixed and for what purpose.NIFA.org \\"About NIFA\\" (https://nifa.usda.gov/about-nifa)  Research and theory  There is a plethora of research pertaining to community gardens, urban farming, and their impact on local communities. The literature tries to connect the activities of community gardens and urban agricultural projects to social, health, and economic outcomes. However, due to the overwhelming lack of diversity in the perspectives that inform the food justice movement, a new concept of just sustainability has been proposed. To address white and middle class culture dominating the discussion and priorities of organic food and sustainability practices, a more multi-cultural and intersectional approach is suggested that includes the narratives of historically marginalized communities. = Food movements and race = Positionality and the different food movement perspectives. \\"Pollan‚Äôs analysis presumes that food-ways are individual choices removed from their social and economic constraints. In a critique rooted in the environmental justice movement, food justice activists demonstrate that institutional racism, in its intersections with economic inequality, has stripped communities of color of their local food sovereignty, preventing them from eating in the way the food movement describes as proper. By aiming their critique at the structural barriers communities of color face to accessing local and organic food, the food justice movement hopes to craft collective racial and cultural identities through the celebration of particular foods while reaching out to those whose food-ways still reflect the dominance of American agribusiness.\\"  Food justice and policy  According to Wekerle, food justice has emerged as a way of applying food security and anti-hunger movements to policy. \\"Theoretically, the food justice frame opens up linkages to a wider range of conceptual frameworks drawn from the literature on democracy, citizenship, social movements, and social and environmental justice.\\" Food justice emerged as a way of applying food security and anti-hunger movements to policy by drawing from established social and environmental theoretical frameworks. The food justice movement is related to food sovereignty in that it critiques ‚Äústructural barriers communities of color face to accessing local and organic foods‚Äù (Alkon et al.) that are largely due to institutional racism and the effect it has on economic equality. Fighting for family farmers to keep and sustain their land, or ensuring access to healthy foods to those previously denied affordable nourishment, there are many ways people contribute to remedy the accessibility of quality of food in the US. Organizations and festivals such as the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, Familias Unidas por la Justicia, and Farm Aid are credited as working to raise awareness of or assist with food justice by fighting for family farmers to keep and sustain their land, fair pay and treatment of workers, and ensuring access to healthy foods to those previously denied affordable nourishment.  Food deserts  Food deserts are a phenomenon described as geographic areas wherein there is a lack of access to food supply, such as a typical chain grocery store within reachable distance. In a so-called food desert, it is typical that liquor stores with no fresh food, only offering bagged chips, sodas, and other quick eat items that lack nutritional substance, are available, alongside fast food restaurants who lack healthy options. In a Report to Congress done by the United States Department of Agriculture, it was found that 23.5 million Americans live more than one mile away from a grocery store and do not have access to a car. While public transportation can help bridge the gap and get individuals living in a food market to a grocery store, economic factors have pushed many local stores out of business requiring some individuals to take many buses or trains just to gain access to a sub-par market. Although access to healthy foods is beneficial, the communities in which markets serve are disadvantaged in the economic sphere. If the cost of fruits and vegetables do not meet consumer budgets, they will not purchase them. = Food apartheid = Anthropologists studying diet and culture, have re-termed food deserts, into Food apartheid. The change in colloquial term has been made to represent that \\"food deserts\\" are not desolate, empty neighborhoods, but are neighborhoods who have been deemed to be unworthy of having access to nutritious food. Food apartheid is a form of apartheid because in most cases, the lack of availability of healthy food disproportionately affects communities of color. According to Jacqueline Bediako, food apartheid affects people of all races, including poor white people, although Black and brown people are affected disproportionately. Under these conditions ‚Äî which are overtly abusive ‚Äî whole communities are geographically and economically isolated from healthy food options. = Food mirages and food swamps = While food deserts have been used as a blanket term to describe food deserts, food mirages, and food swamps, they are not synonymous and they all differ in how they relate to the access of food. To further support that prices play a key role in the consumption of healthy foods, the term \\"food mirage\\" has been used to describes low-income communities with access to supermarkets but with financial barriers to access those healthy foods. In a study done by researchers at Portland State University, a food mirage was examined in a neighborhood where residents living in poverty were surrounded by new grocery stores. Researchers found that out of the 81% of impoverished residents surveyed, 61% percent lived in moderate or extreme food mirage. Resulting in traveling more than 1.8 miles past their neighborhood grocery store in search of better prices. While food deserts are often assessed by the distance in miles between individuals' homes and supermarkets, and food mirages assess price and poverty relativity, food swamps differ in that they are described as geographic areas with a high density of establishments that sell high calorie \\"fast food\\" and \\"junk food\\". A comprehensive review of research done on food swamps by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, has found that 10 out of 12 studies provided evidence that fast food restaurants are more likely to locate in areas where there are higher concentrations of ethnic minorities than areas populated by Whites.  Structural inequities and disparity  The relationship between food environments and its effects on obesity has been examined and has revealed to play a major role in the contribution to health disparities, particularly the presence of fast food restaurants and convenience stores. In neighborhoods that have access barriers to supermarkets because of proximity or prices, consumers are left with only two options; convenience stores and fast food restaurants. Low-income communities that are \\"lacking healthy food access‚Äîcan simultaneously be ‚Äòfood swamps,‚Äô consisting in a saturation of access to unhealthy food (e.g., fast-food, convenience stores) and nonfood (e.g., gas stations) venues, characterized by calorie- dense and high-sugared food items\\", these environments reinforce unhealthy behaviors among residents. Currently, there are few policies that look at the food environment, beyond food deserts, in disadvantaged neighborhoods. In one intervention by Los Angeles policymakers, a zone ordinance that banned new free standing fast food restaurants overlooked the complexities of low-income environments. Rather than focusing on limiting specific types of fast food restaurants and convenience stores, the policy left many loopholes that allowed establishments like McDonald's to open among strip malls. Strip malls are abundant in low-income communities, they are attractive to fast food restaurants because of lower rents and greater access to consumers. Although it was one of the first attempts, this demonstrates the importance of creating research based policies that clearly examine the complexities of low-income neighborhoods to address health disparities. It has been argued that living within close proximity of fast-food restaurants increases the consumption of high calorie foods. For example, in one study, results indicated that \\"Fast food establishments within both a quarter and half mile had a statistically significant negative relationship with fruit and vegetable consumption.\\" This means that the easier access a resident had to fast food, the least likely they were to consume fruits and vegetables. Moreover, fast food restaurants provide inexpensive meals, making them highly attractive to low-income consumers. Using Geo-coded information, a study for the Harvard School of Public Health, found evidence indicating that fast-food restaurants are more prevalent in minority neighborhoods, which are often low-income neighborhoods. If food prices have shown to make an impact on food choices among under-served communities, it would make sense that the low cost of fast food would be appealing to consumers in low-income communities. Unfortunately, the low cost of fast-food comes at another price, fast food is high in calories and unhealthy fats, like processed food in convenience stores or supermarkets, consuming these foods puts one at risk of obesity. Many residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods rely on fast and convenient foods, corner stores such as liquor stores are abundant in low-income communities. Convenience stores carry foods that are highly processed to extend shelf life, resulting in an abundance of calories, fat, sugar and salt. Additionally, consumers turn to convenience stores because they accept government assistance programs such as SNAP, further perpetuating unhealthy behaviors in food choice and the significance of redesigning food policies. Another reason convenience store foods are appealing to those living in low-income communities is that those living with food insecurity require to stretch their food, processed foods do not require refrigeration and last longer than perishable foods. By considering how food environments affect low income communities, policymakers can make better informed decisions on how policies can address contributing factors. = Residential segregation leads to commercial flight = Food apartheid and the lack of access to food are the results of racist politicking and they stem from socioeconomic injustices that disproportionately affect low income Black communities. According to the ACLU‚Äîfood deserts are the direct manifestation of structural inequities that have been solidified over time. These institutional racisms that have resulted in a lack of access to healthy food for minorities are innumerable‚Äîbut among them include housing policies leading to segregated communities and financial policies leading to commercial flight. These policies have all interacted over time to contribute to health disparities among the Black community. In 1962, 61% of white Americans shared the sentiment that \\"white people[possessed] a right to keep blacks out of their neighborhoods if they [wanted] to, and blacks should respect that right.\\"James H. Carr and Nandinee K. Kutty, The New Imperative for Equality, in Segregation: The Rising Cost for Americans 40, 68 (James H. Carr & Nandinee K. Kutty, eds., 2008). Despite years of policy changes a result of the Civil Rights Movement, 30 years later in 1990, a Detroit survey of whites found that a quarter of white respondents would not move into a neighborhood that was more than 50% Black. Discrimination towards Blacks continues to influence real estate practices, while public policies and institutional discrimination continue to reinforce race segregated living patterns. Although segregation by race is illegal, it has not ceased to be the standard in America. Living patterns are not only correlated with access to educational opportunities, and employment opportunities‚Äîthey are also correlated to access to food. Studies published by American Journal of Preventative Medicine have found that low- income neighborhoods and minority neighborhoods are less likely to have access to large supermarkets. Federal government policies have directly hindered the development of supermarkets in Black populated communities. As middle-income whites got subsidized government loans to move from cities to suburbia, businesses, including supermarkets, relocated with them. Grocery stores and retailers alike, were supported by the United States government to relocate to the suburbs‚Äîcatering to the White middle class and leaving the cities desolate.  Health outcomes related to nutrition in communities of color  Although causal relationships between food habits and substandard health have not been exclusively made, it is well accepted that there is a definitely a correlation between the two. Since communities of color are disproportionately affected by food apartheid, it is no shock that Black Americans and Hispanics suffer from rates of obesity at 45% and 36.8%, respectively‚Äîwhich is comparatively higher than the white rate of obesity at 30%. According to the Centers For Disease Control, obesity has been linked to a wide range of health problems including Type 2 Diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, various types of cancer, hypertension, and high cholesterol among both adults and children. In a 2004 study done by medical doctors and public health professionals of New York's Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, a community coalition study was done to compare the availability and cost of diabetes-healthy foods in a Black populated neighborhood in East Harlem with that of the adjacent White, wealthy Upper East Side in New York City. Researched surveyed 173 East Harlem and 152 Upper East Side grocery stores to find whether or not they stocked 5 basic diabetes-diet recommended foods. Results showed that only 18% of East Harlem stores stocked the recommended foods, compared with 58% of stores in the Upper East Side. Further, they found that only 9% of East Harlem bodegas (convenience stores) carried all 5 recommended items while 48% of Upper East Side bodegas carried the items. This discrepancy is huge, and is a representation of many communities in America. Since health conditions such diabetes are more prevalent in Black communities than White communities, this creates a cycle in which type 2 diabetes continues to thrive. = Victim blaming = Access to food disproportionately affects minority communities, but victim-blaming narratives about them exist. For example, an article published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service entitled \\"Access to Affordable, Nutritious Food is Limited in Food Deserts\\", it is stated that consumers' demographic and economic characteristics, buying habits, and tastes can explain why stores do not locate in some areas or carry particularly healthy foods. Some criticized that such argument blames the communities themselves for the lack of access to healthy food and fails to acknowledge the historical influences and governmental policies that have marginalized these minority communities.  Food Sovereignty  Food sovereignty is defined in the Declaration of Ny√©l√©ni as ‚Äúthe right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems.‚ÄùDeclaration of Ny√©l√©ni (2007) Retrieved from https://viacampesina.org/en/declaration-of-nyi It revolves around the issues of ‚Äúself determination, global uneven development, and ecological degradation,‚Äù issues commonly associated with the Global South and rural Global North. This differs from food justice, which mostly describes inaccessibility and consumption of healthy food. Other common areas of food sovereignty discourse include issues of scarcity, environmental factors, population growth, and allocation of resources. Food sovereignty often places emphasis on property rights of indigenous communities and small-scale farmers. = Food Sovereignty and the Global South = Colonialism is also a major source of food insecurity in the Global South. Colonialism had a direct impact on those who depended on seasonal farming due to prolonged droughts in certain regions, however, colonial policy often made important pasture and water resources legally inaccessible. Food insecurity has been perpetuated by post- colonial policies more recently through the inflation of food prices, aggregation of cropland, and displacement of groups from land available for food crops. Similarly, colonial policies that encouraged the planting of cash crops for export over subsistence crops has continued to affect food security in the Global South. Many Global South countries have subsequently become dependent on food aid from Global North nations. = Food Sovereignty and the United States = Food sovereignty is also an important part of the food justice movement in Global North countries, such as the United States. In the United States, food sovereignty is a critical part of indigenous food activism. Indigenous food sovereignty activists argue that indigenous communities have been systematically displaced from their traditional foodways, which has led to mass food insecurity. They assert that the most effective way to achieve food security for indigenous groups is for those groups to be more involved in the production of their own food.Murphy, Andi. (2019). Indigenous Food Security is Dependent on Food Sovereignty. Retrieved from https://civileats.com/2019/07/24/indigenous-food-security-is-dependent- on-food-sovereignty/ Some activists also argue for food sovereignty as a means of healing historical trauma. Food sovereignty of indigenous groups is also closely linked to seed sovereignty and plant breeders‚Äô rights.LaDuke, Winona. (2012). Seeds of Our Ancestors, Seeds of Life, TEDxTC. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHNlel72eQc This is because seed saving is an important practice both culturally and for the preservation of a large enough seed stock to feed communities.White, Rowen. (2018). The Native Seed Pod, Episode 1. https://www.nativeseedpod.org/podcast/2018/episode-1-the-natural- law-of-seeds  Possible solutions  Food insecurity recognized as one of the world's current most pressing issues. In fact, agricultural food scientists and corporations argue that responding to the issue using food justice practices is not sufficient in regards to the urgency of the issue. Such argumentation is the basis for defending the use of GMOs to feed the world. However research from scholars, farmers, and NGO's go to disprove this by presenting that smaller scale farming has been proven to be not only environmentally friendly but can in fact ‚Äòfeed the world.‚Äô = Urban or community farms = One of the first tactics to battle the food injustice and scarcity found in both rural and urban areas is by the use of community or urban gardens. Community gardens, according to the American Community Gardening Association's (ACGA) mission statement, are essential catalysts for the neighborhood and surrounding community by not only helping combat food insecurity in providing healthy food options but it is also economically and environmentally sound, these gardens also provide a source for recreation, therapy, beauty and education. In addition, having communal gardens may also benefit immigrants and refugees who use gardening as a tactic to immerse themselves in new surroundings while also getting a chance to reconnect with their culture and receive food for their family and community. This epitomizes how the Center for Rural Affairs sees the working of the community food system of which may take many forms but at its core aims to, form a connection between the producers locals who grow or make the food and the consumers, the community. Despite the great change and development community gardens bring, many in these communities had to fight for the right to use the land for gardening which was evident in the 1960s with \\"guerrilla gardening\\" tactics to combat land scarcity and resist the, \\"inequalities between the powerful and powerless.\\" Today, according to the ACGA annual report, 61% of community or urban gardens are found on government lands, indicating the important role local governments play in the allowing or blocking the use of community gardens through the implementation of opposing legislation or strict land use policies. = Produce availability = Equity in both the decision making process and the distribution of resources is the core of the food justice movement and can be achieved through government policies. One possible course of action to combat food deserts may be in mandating that corner stores and such in food deserts provide some variation of fruits and vegetables. For instance in Minneapolis :the Department of Health and Family Support understood that residents in food deserts find themselves purchasing their staple foods from corner stores, unable to travel to grocery stores or ‚Äòlocal‚Äô farmers markets, however more often than not convenience stores carry more unhealthy quick foods rather than fresh produce. To combat this issue the Minneapolis City Council passed an ordinance requiring Minneapolis corner stores to carry, ‚Äúfive varieties of perishable produce‚Äù and the Minnesota Department of Health requires, ‚ÄúWIC-certified stores to carry a minimum of seven varieties (and thirty pounds) of fresh produce.‚Äù However even with the ordinances North Minneapolis residents who, \\"shopped most often at corner stores...did not purchase produce from them,‚Äù due to factors such as produce being out of site or not fresh. This indicates however that ordinances as such may not always be enough. In the case of Minneapolis, the MDHFS created the Healthy Corner Store Program to ensure the success of the ordinance by providing assistance from a grocery store consultant to store owners to, ‚Äúmaking healthy foods and fresh produce more visible, affordable, and attractive to neighborhood residents.‚Äù Another possible solution to food injustices and specifically food injustice, may be in making new regulations providing that there be more grocery stores in urban and rural areas. The USDA also sees this as an issue in stating that 2.2 million Americans have difficulty in accessing large grocery stores due to have to travel over a mile in urban areas or more than 10 in urban areas may increase reliance on convenience stores and restaurants(fast food), resulting in a poor diet and diet-related health problems. The USDA recognizes that the limited food access in Urban core areas, ‚Äúare characterized by higher levels of racial segregation and greater income inequality.‚Äù In small-town and rural areas with limited the lack of transportation infrastructure.‚Äù However not all chain groceries will go into small neighborhoods due to the risk and upkeep, For places like West Oakland in California, where just about half the residents don‚Äôt have a car, access to grocery stores is even more so a struggle, so Brahm Ahmadi, decided to open his own full service grocery store na health center by selling bonds directly to the public. = Food vending = Food trucks and other local services provide another option to help provide food to food deserts and other rural areas. In some places these food trucks like the Second Harvest Food Bank's Produce Mobile Program help communities and neighborhoods in need by providing them with high-quality and fresh produce. Food trucks are another important source of food, and are unique in their mobilitiy but also in their locations.Food trucks are found in cities, towns, and universities all over the United States and Canada although they have a longer history in places like Portland where there was little laws preventing them or Los Angeles where immigrants carried on traditions. Other spaces for these vendors became fairly recent in places like Montreal where trucks and cultural spaces were previously regulated. Although often overlooked because they may not always supply the most ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô food, they help combat food insecurity by supplying food to communities that either have no other means of getting food or simply bringing more food options into the community. Food trucks have also been labeled, ‚Äúpowerful affirmation of pop-up urbanism,‚Äù that are controlled by ordinary people creating culturally different and creative spaces. However, food trucks and other street vendors have often been banned by cities if they did not have permits or if they were considered a competitive threat to establishments nearby. Yet recently, new legislation in California (SB946)and Arizona ( HB 2371) are aimed to not only legalize food trucks statewide but also decriminalize the sidewalk vending. Legislation like these will not only help to boost the local economy but it will also allow vendors to safely and securely provide food to the community.However food trucks are not just an American or Western phenomenon, they are part of a phenomenon that has been quite common in much of the Global South. Food vending in the Global South slightly differs as food vending enables many to simply survive, hang on, and cope with urban towns. It also allows them to develop networks and strategies to get by in these towns by forming relationships with commercial and small- holder irrigation farmers. Food delivery services are another way from either local grocery stores or market boxes sent to your door. However, some of these tend to be expensive or require internet accessibility to control your account, depending on the community especially those in rural areas this option may not be possible. There are other innovations from the nonprofit, social enterprise sector that show promise for connecting residents with limited access to fresh food to sources of fresh produce. New Roots Fresh Stop Markets were created in 2009 with the express purpose of \\"igniting community power for fresh food access.\\" Fresh Stop Markets are fresh food markets that pop up biweekly in urban fresh food insecure communities in Louisville, Kentucky, southern Indiana, and in two rural Kentucky towns‚ÄîHazard and Brandenburg. Families agree to cooperate with each other and pool their resources‚ÄîSNAP Benefits and Debit/Credit‚Äîon an income-based sliding scale, a week ahead, purchasing in bulk from local, organic farmers. This big buying power creates an opportunity for farmers to sell to a committed group with no risk, while families benefit from wholesale prices. Each family receives the same share (bag) of fresh, seasonal produce regardless of what they pay. Fresh Stop Markets always feature a chef or culinary enthusiast who demos fresh, plant-based dishes, distributes recipes and shares information and support. Veggie cheerleaders advocate for the vegetables so that everyone feels comfortable with the varieties offered. Fresh Stop Markets are volunteer driven by shareholders so that everyone from children to older adults can offer to share their knowledge with others.  SNAP and other food assistance programs  Another solution to potentially combat the food injustice, both in terms of quality and quantity of food, is in government provided subsidies and vouchers to help alleviate financial burden in affording food, as well as making healthier options available. The U.S. Federal government, as many other governments has put in much of its resources, approximately 50 billion dollars per year towards nutrition assistance programs. Snap is one of these programs, mitigated by the federal government under the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) in the 1960s that according to one of their publications, ‚Äúimproves health, enhances self- sufficiency, and alleviates food insecurity.‚Äù The Public Policy Institute has conducted research showing that since the introduction of food stamps, they have reduced illnesses attributed to poor diet such as diabetes and increased average birth weights among adults who had access to the program from youth. Food vouchers such as Calfresh had success in reducing, ‚Äúfood insecurity among low-income households‚Äù during the recent recession. However, despite the efforts made by these comprehensive assistance networks the United States has failed to make little to no advancement towards reducing food insecurity to 6% , relative to 1995 when measurements of food inequity within households began. With prevalent ideas/facts like these as well as the fear of fraudulent cases the federal government has proposed a new way to alleviate food insecurity and provide what it deems as healthier choices in the Food Harvest Program. The harvest program would cut the budget for SNAP by 30% over the next ten years by using a food delivery service to provide a box of non-perishable ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù goods to the recipients including a set box with canned fruits, vegetables, meats, peanut butter, and canned or frozen meat, and shelf stable milk, each box will be sized to the family size and granted benefits. However other sources note that those with more than $90 a month in benefits, additional to the box will have any remaining balance put on to their EBT cards. In terms of what the impact on food insecurity is unknown however there is a lack of choice in terms of what food the participants can have. Even though many still purchase foods that are deemed unhealthy much of this is due to the fact that some may live in substandard housing or not have a functional kitchen so these foods, although some may be healthy will not always be suitable for all recipients. In comparison to SNAP, the administration's new program would only cover 90,000 people, while the former helped millions to come out of poverty. There are still many questions left to answer, like delivery and how recipients will receive their boxes, as the use of delivery may pose a risk for delays. Beyond money there are children and summer food programs enacted in various states including California that allows either free or reduced lunches for those in food deserts and underprivileged neighborhoods. These initiatives allow these individuals to have food security in having necessary access to food they wouldn't be able to have otherwise. Being that schools are pivotal institutions in securing food availability, the USDA has, done its part in having healthy/wholesome options available by adding new items to school lunches such as frozen rather than canned mixed berries and vegetables, grilled chicken breast fillets, egg patty rounds, and white whole wheat flour.  Education  Many argue that simply increasing availability and providing vouchers will not solve the food justice issue in regards to food deserts, which is where the argument for nutrition education comes in. Studies have been shown that eating habits don't change when put grocery stores in poor neighborhoods as reiterated by Barry Popkin, a professor of Nutrition at the University of North Carolina stated that simply adding a grocery store in poor neighborhoods, will not make a huge impact as food prices and people's shopping and eating habits undermine convenience.  GMO‚Äôs  Many solutions target how to improve conditions in urban areas or rural areas however the food injustice and food sovereignty issue is a global one that also deals with resource availability and scarcity. Food Scarcity is and has been a motivating force behind companies such as Monsanto who campaigned on feeding the world by using genetic engineering of plants. Such plants that Monsanto and other companies create include, Herbicide-tolerant soybeans, herbicide-tolerant corn, and Bt or insect repellent corn. However, according to recent reports in comparison to conventional methods, GMO's and herbicide tolerant plants have failed to increase intrinsic or operational yields. The report does acknowledge the possibility of genetic engineering eventually contributing to increase crop yields, however, the Union of Concerned Scientists note that when using farming practices that use minimal pesticides and synthetic fertilizers such as organic farming, \\"can more than double crop yields at little cost to poor farmers in such developing regions as Sub- Saharan Africa.‚Äù According to a study, within the first year government- subsidized supermarkets in high need neighborhoods households were reported to have a significance effect on food availability and consumption habits. Reasoning behind this includes that individuals formed reliance on their usual supermarkets and the abundance and affordability of processed foods. Due to these reasons, overall lower income families bought less healthy food than wealthier families, however there were even greater disparities found, ‚Äúbetween families with and without a college education.‚Äù These results suggest that in order to improve a person's diet and change perceptions it is essential that their be education on diet and health on top of increasing food accessibility and affordability. However the affordability of food may in fact influence food choice if the government chose to not only subsidize fruits and vegetables but also tax fast food, \\"to improve weight outcomes among children and adolescents.‚Äù  See also  * Food Security * Sustainable agriculture * Slow Food * Food sovereignty * Fair Trade * Fair Food Program * Agroecology * Right to food  References  Category:Sustainable agriculture Category:Sustainability Category:Sustainable food system Category:Justice ","title":"Food Justice Movement"},{"id":"53957983","text":"Pillet is a surname.

As such, it was the most significant feminist organization in the interwar period. Founded by Franti≈°ka Plam√≠nkov√°, its members strove for reform of marriage laws and employment restrictions of women, which they believed had been promised by the equality mandate in the new constitution. History After the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 and passage of its constitution in 1920, Franti≈°ka Plam√≠nkov√°, a politician who recognized the need for an effective lobbying group for women's issues, established the Women's National Council (≈ΩNR) in 1923. Throughout the life of the organization, Plam√≠nkov√° served as the president. The governing documents of the ≈ΩNR were approved by the Ministry of the Interior on 24 February 1923, and soon after its formation joined the International Council of Women and the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. The organization was established as an umbrella organization to unite other women's organizations in gaining political and civic equality for women. Established in Prague, with a branch office in Brno, by 1935, they had fifty affiliated organizations and some 2,200 members without regard to creed, nationality or political affiliation. Most of the affiliated organizations were professional organizations of civil servants, social workers and teachers, with membership among the educated middle class. Because the organization focused on Czech women and meetings and correspondence was in the Czech language women identifying as German or Slovak rarely joined, though the Slovak network, ≈Ωivena and several German and Jewish organizations were members. The organization's leadership was staunchly anti-clerical, which often precluded Catholic women's organizations from participating. Politically, the membership included members of the Agrarian Party, Communist Party, National Socialist Party and Social Democratic Party, but most of the executive were aligned with the conservative National Democrats. The ≈ΩNR worked to educate women about their rights, as well as to mold public opinion. To that end, they worked to establish a library of materials about women both from within Czechoslovakia and abroad. The organization collected women's literature, and specifically tried to obtain information on reforms, draft laws, and pending legislation which might impact women's equality. Members were encouraged to contact legislative members, trade unions and libraries in other jurisdictions to expand the information ≈ΩNR could offer for study to members, public officials and journalists. They also established a journal, ≈Ωensk√° rada (Women's advice) which was published from 1925 to 1938 and edited by Plam√≠nkov√°. Developing a number of departments, the organization focused on women's civil status as wives and employees, educational opportunities, family matters and parenting, legal status, morality, pacifism, personal freedom, and societal improvement. Members like Milada Hor√°kov√°, Marie Svozilov√° and Hana Vichov√° devoted speeches and articles to criticize the government's failure to implement laws for equality which was constitutionally guaranteed. They demanded an end to employment discrimination on the basis of sex and insisted that equal pay for employment based on education and skill be upheld. Because the civil code designated the man as head of the household, women by law were legal dependents having the same position as children, with decision-making authority over their economic life or guardianship concerns for their children. ≈ΩNR drafted a new civil code which called for equality of spouses as well as for their mutual care of dependents and each other. Each spouse should have the right to work and the responsibility for care of the family with equal decision-making authority, and for domestic maintenance. There should be equality in division of assets, the right of spouses to choose their legal name, the right of divorce and equal alimony regardless to the sex of the lower earning partner. Their suggestions were rejected and though the law was revised in 1931, men still maintained authority over children, property and their wives; the only substantive change being that marriage would henceforward be a civil partnership, rather than a religious rite. With the advent of the Great Depression and austerity measures put in place at that time, ≈ΩNR pressed for relief programs that provided assistance to the unemployed, rather than the mass dismissal of women workers. The women also worked for assistance programs for the disabled, illegitimate children and orphans, a juvenile court system, protections for women prisoners, and a comprehensive reform of unemployment schemes, specifically for the establishment of a women's unemployment fund. When the Nazi occupation began in 1938, women lost ground. Implementation of programs outlawing all political parties except the state-sponsored party, which women could not join, effectively silenced the ≈ΩNR's ability to engage politically. State-sponsored paternalism ensured that the women's choices were curtailed and President Emil H√°cha took over the appointment of the women who were to serve on the ≈ΩNR board, some of whom were not members of the organization. The intent was to subvert the concerns of women from women's issues and point them toward state- approved activities which would benefit the state. in 1942, the organization was outlawed.

History The first recorded school on Wornington Road was known as the Wornington Road Board School established in March 1874. The building was divided into a Boys, a Girls and an Infants school. A little later a school for the blind was added. The Infants‚Äô School was the largest in London finding places for 813 children in ten classrooms. The building was an imposing one, reflecting the new emphasis on education, but its location adjacent to the railway with steam trains thundering past every few minutes was a hindrance. A reference in Sentimental Education: Schooling, Popular Culture and the Regulation of Liberty by James Donald, '... in the board school Robson designed in Wornington Rd 1874'. Edward Robert Robson architect and author of the highly influential ‚ÄòSchool Architecture‚Äô in 1876. He then became architect at the LCC (presumably London County Council). The building was demolished in 1936 by The London County Council to be replaced by Wornington Road Elementary School with better facilities including a library and a gymnasium with changing rooms and showers. During WWII the school buildings became an emergency centre for the Auxiliary Fire Service. Classrooms were turned into dormitories for the firefighters and the school medical room became a Watch Room from which emergency calls were taken and fire engines dispatched to deal with the effects of the blitz in the nearby streets. Smaller school house on south corner of the site also rebuilt around 1936, LCC Architects' Department. Signed off by G.P. Wheeler. After the war The Florence Gladstone School, which educated girls between 11 and 15, used the Wornington Road building from 1951. Then from 1958 it was the turn of the Isaac Newton Boys‚Äô Upper School. The Wornington Road Infants‚Äô School was still in the premises in the 1950s. When it closed the Ainsworth Nursery moved in but moved again in 1977 to the ground floor of Trellick Tower. The Isaac Newton boys moved out when their school joined with Holland Park Comprehensive in 1983. Alan Johnson the MP has written extensively about his life in the area and attending the school. Changes Significant changes in the local community were reflected in the ongoing use of the building, Adult Education had expanded during the seventies under the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) and as the number of primary school pupils dropped due classrooms at Wornington Road were increasingly used for evening and day classes for adults. By 1972 there were four orchestras and two choirs, special English and Maths classes for ‚Äòpeople newly arrived in England who speak no English or wish to improve their English‚Äò. 'Fresh Start' courses were provided for adults who had missed out on basic skills and ‚Äòmature students‚Äô were supported via a pioneering Return to Study course to prepare for university entrance. Caroline Benn, wife of the MP, has described her role as a lecturer in this department at the college. The building hosted the Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre from 1992 until the move to purpose built premises in Acklam Road in 1998. College Wornington Road ultimately became the hub of Kensington and Chelsea College with many thousands of students attending a wide range of vocational courses. Established in its present form in 1993 when finance became available from the Further Education Funding Council, the Kensington and Chelsea College now runs many part-time courses, some Wornington students go on to higher education, while others retrain to acquire skills needed in a changing employment market. In 2013 this campus renamed from Wornington Centre to Kensington Centre.

Parts of the Boaf√§lt are located in the British sector at block 9/15. The reservoir consists of early-tier sandstone. The depth of the area is 120‚Äì130 meters. The production ship is located approximately 12 km west of Heimdal Gassenter, at .  The field  Alvheim field was found in 1998 and recovery license 088 BS and 036 C for blocks 24/6 and 25/4 were awarded in 2003. The field was approved by the King of Norway in government council 6 October 2004. The operator is Aker BP.  Geology  The reservoir consists of sandstone. Recoverable reserves were estimated by submitting plans for development and operation to 23.5x106 Sm¬≥ with oil and 5.7x109 Sm¬≥ with gas but has since been updated to 27.5 million Sm¬≥ oil and 8.1 billion Sm¬≥ gas.  The development concept  The field is built with wellhead basins on the seabed that are linked to the production ship Alvheim FPSO. The production vessel is 252 meters long and 42 meters wide and has the capacity to store 560,000 barrels of oil. The oil will be transported to land by tanker, while the production of rich gas is conducted in a pipeline from Alvheim to the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) system in the British sector. The Volund field (operator: Aker BP) and Vilje field (operator: Aker BP) are also linked to Alvheim FPSO. Production at Alvheim started June 8, 2008. The multipurpose ship MST Odin has been rebuilt as a production vessel at Alvheim. MST Odin was previously owned by Statoil. The boat was completed in September 2001 and was previously used as tanker. The facility is under a maritime operating concept with DNV class and carries the Norwegian flag from the Norwegian Maritime Directorate. Marathon assumes that the device is certified on the field the 20 years it is expected to produce, and is not to be landed for main classification. Pressure relief using gas lift is the chosen recovery strategy at Alvheim. The field is extracted in three phases. In phase I, 12 horizontal wells are drilled, three of them with two branches. Oil products will be drilled from freestanding beams, which are coupled to manifolds prior to pipeline transfer to MST Odin via a riser base. There are also two wells for injection of produced water. These will be free standing and connect directly to pipeline without manifolds. On the production ship, the oil will be stabilized and stored before export from the tanker. Due to weight and cost, the operator has chosen not to fully process the gas on the production vessel. The part of the gas that does not contribute to gas lift is exported as rich gas in a 14-inch gas pipeline from Alvheim, across to the British shelf and linked to the SAGE system. Total length of the pipe is 35.5 km. The oil is picked up on the float of tankers. The operator plans to produce oil until 2022 before the gas is blown down. In total, the life of the field will be 20 years. M√¶rsk was a contractor at Alvheim in the early years, but since then Marathon has taken over. The owner and operator from 2016 is Aker BP.  Drilling  Aker BP has drilled and completed two water injection wells and ten production wells on the Alvheim field, of which an existing exploration well is sidebored and completed as a production well. The drilling of the production wells is done by Odfjell Drilling using Deepsea Bergen. The same drilling contractor was also used while drilling exploration wells on the field. The water injection wells are drilled vertically and the purpose of these will be to receive produced water pumped into the Utsira formation. The wells are supplemented without a safety valve, as the reservoir pressure in the Utsira formation is not high enough to cause outflow of water. Production wells are horizontal wells with horizontal sections up to 2441 meters in length. Transocean Winner (released) and Transocean Arctic (currently) have been drilling on these and other nearby fields in recent years.  Power  There are gas powered turbines to generate electric power for the process. These are equipped with elements to regain heat from the exhaust gas and have diesel as an alternative. It is installing Low-NOx technology on these.  Open drainage systems  Aker BP has installed a drainage system that has separate collector pipes for drainage from classified and unclassified areas, but will have a collective tank for drainage from these areas.  Sub sea  The subsea system at Alvheim consists of single wells that are connected to a manifold with production pipes and gas injection pipes. In the manifold, the well stream is mixed with well flow from the other single wells, and the production then flows into a pipeline to the riser base under the ship (FPSO). There are four such manifolds, each with space to connect and control four wells: one over Boa; two over Kneler (Kneler A and Kneler B); and one above East Kameleon. Flexible ladders associated with the riser base transport the oil and gas to the processing plant on the ship. In Phase II and III there will be new production wells to ensure an appropriate pressure relief of East Kameleon and of Kameleon gas capabilities. Final placement and timing of these will be based on experience gained through early production years. The system has been planned to allow for possible attachment of future third party manufacturers. It has been taken into account that the Klegg field should be linked.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. History In 1878, a Victorian Gothic county courthouse was constructed on Third Street in Manistee, Michigan. In 1887 two fountains were placed on the courthouse grounds, to each side and slightly in front of the courthouse itself. These fountains remained in place until 1950, when the courthouse was destroyed by fire. At that time, the Portage Lake Garden Club, a civic improvement club located in Onekama, accepted one of the fountains to be placed in the Onekama Village Park. It is possible that this fountain was actually constructed from pieces of the two, as only a few fragments of the \\"other\\" fountain exist. The fountain was installed in Onekama in July 1950, and landscaping added around it. It was dedicated in August 1951. In 1974, as a result of damage to the fountain, it was removed, repaired, and reinstalled. Description The Memorial Fountain is an ornamental fountain made of cast iron, standing on a concrete base and topped with a lead statue of a merman riding a dolphin and blowing a horn. The entire fountain is 77 inches high and 88 inches wide. It is constructed in three tiers, with a wide lower basin at the bottom, a pedestal supporting a central basin in the middle, and a second pedestal supporting the upper basin an merman statue at the top. An inscription, \\"Patented April 11, 1871\\" appears on the surface of the fountain. The basins are decorated with designs featuring storks, cat-o'-nine tails, lilly leaves, and flowers, as well as acanthus, flute, and scallop designs.

He composed numerous art songs as well as 22 operas, largely in the op√©ra comique genre. In his later years he was a professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatory and the curator of the conservatory's museum of musical instruments, many of which had come from his own large collection. Life and career Clapisson's family was originally from Lyon where his grandfather had been a maker of wind instruments. Clapisson was born in Naples while his father Antoine was working there as a professor at the Naples Conservatory and as the principal horn-player in the orchestra of the Teatro San Carlo. The family returned to France after the Neapolitan War in 1815 and eventually settled in Bordeaux. Clapisson showed a precocious talent as a violinist. As a boy he toured the south of France giving violin concerts under the tutelage of Pierre-Louis Hus-Desforges. In 1830 he entered the Paris Conservatory to study violin under Fran√ßois Habeneck and harmony under Anton Reicha. He also obtained a position as first violinist in the orchestra of the Th√©√¢tre-Italien and later as second violinist in the Paris Opera orchestra.Almanach de la musique (Suppl√©ment: N√©crologie des Musiciens) (1867). \\"Clapisson, Antoine-Louis\\", pp. 12‚Äì14.

His first compositions were vocal pieces (quartets and duets) which were performed at the Paris Conservatory concert series from 1835. His first operatic work was La Figurante, a five-act op√©ra comique to a libretto by Eug√®ne Scribe and Jean-Henri Dupin. It premiered on 24 August 1838. Twenty-one more would follow, almost all in the op√©ra comique genre, although he did produce one grand opera, Jeanne la folle, which premiered at the Paris Opera in 1848. His last work was an operetta, La Poularde de Caux. It was co-written with five other composers and premiered in 1861, the same year he was appointed professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatory.

She helped establish permanent churches there in the first part of the twentieth century. Hettie Lee Ewing was born on October 11, 1896 in Corpus Christi, Texas to Marcus Lafayette and Lenora Lee (Stringer) Ewing. Her early life was fairly unremarkable, she was single, living at home with her parents and teaching high school in Corpus Christi, Texas. This was all about to change though and in May 1924, Ewing was attending services at the Furman Avenue Church of Christ when a letter from Lillie Delanzia Cypert a female missionary in Japan, was read to the congregation. In her letter, Cypert expressed her desire to find someone her age who would come to Japan to work with her. After the services, Ewing met with the preacher, O. E. Phillips, to discuss this appeal and get more information. In August 1924 Ewing made her intention to go to Japan public. Ewing faced an uphill battle, primarily because she was single woman, her family was opposed to it and she did not speak a word of Japanese. Regardless, she was determined and Ewing worked on raising money to pay for her trip. She spent a year in Los Angeles at the Westside Church of Christ where Hirosuke Ishiguro helped her learn about the culture and language of Japan and after two years working toward her dream she made the journey. On August 13, 1926, Ewing set sail for Japan; she was 30 years old. When she arrived on September 2, 1926, she was greeted by Lillie Cypert and J. M. McCaleb. Ewing moved into the home of Sarah Shepherd Andrews, who was away on furlough. Helped by two Japanese Christians, Ewing began a Sunday school and Bible classes in Okitsu. She learned the Japanese language and for many years, she taught classes to Japanese women and children and facilitated classes for men by other men. When Sarah Andrews returned to Japan in 1931, Ewing moved to the southeast part of Japan. Shizuoka City. During this time, the Japanese people were quite friendly and accepting of foreigners, but around 1937, she noticed a change. Rationing of all metal, from large items to pins and clips, was instituted. Blackout curtains were ordered to be placed on windows. By 1939, anti-American attitudes were openly expressed and she was followed by plainclothes policemen wherever she went; she and members of the church were interrogated frequently. She really loved the Japanese people and she was reluctant to return to America but she and the Japanese members of the church agreed that she was putting not only herself, but them, in danger by staying. Ewing returned to the Texas in 1941 and got a job with the U.S. Government in San Antonio and was there when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. Since she was fluent in the Japanese language, she transferred to Washington, D.C. and held several jobs there. Eventually, she was assigned to the War Relocation Authority to assist the Japanese/Americans who had been forcibly removed from their homes on the East Coast into the interior of America for the duration of the war. At the end of 1945 the camps were closed down and the people were asked to return to their homes. Most of them had no homes or jobs to return to and it was a huge task to relocate all of them. When her job was finished, she began trying to return to Japan so that she could assist the suffering Japanese Christians, who had sent her letters describing their plight. None of the Christians had died in the bombings, but all of them had lost their homes and all of their possessions and food and clothing was so scarce as to be non-existent. She ran into one roadblock after another to keep her from returning, but one of her greatest strengths was a dogged determination never to give up. She appealed to every possible authority, pulled every string at her disposal, and was finally able to arrive in Japan in 1947, where she lived in the corner of a storeroom with a cot for a bed. At first she had no food but the Japanese Christians shared everything they could from their meager means with her. She began writing letters to Christians in America asking for them to send boxes of food, medicine, and warm clothing and soon was able to help many, many people ‚Äì Christians and non-Christians. She continued as a missionary to Japan until 1972. In 1974, her health was failing and she came back to Texas for good. She lived at Christian Care Center in Mesquite, Texas where she died on September, 18 1986. Works *Ewing, Hettie Lee (1977). Another look at Japan: reminiscences of Hettie Lee Ewing.

The fourteenth named storm, eighth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Madeline developed out of an area of low pressure that formed well to the south-southwest of Baja California. By August 26, the disturbance developed to a tropical depression, before becoming a tropical storm shortly afterwards. Wind shear initially inhibited development, however as the cyclone turned northwest, Madeline underwent rapid intensification as an eye feature developed within the storm on August 29. Madeline ultimately peaked as a Category 4 major hurricane the next day. The hurricane then began to weaken as wind shear began to increase as it approached Hawaii. By September 1, Madeline weakened to a tropical storm and passed just south of the Big Island of Hawaii, dumping heavy rainfall, surf, and gusty winds to the island. The cyclone eventually degenerated into a remnant low on September 2 before dissipating later that day. In advance of both Madeline and Lester to its east, the state of Hawaii began to prepare for a potentially historic strike, possibly two, as the hurricanes approached. Hurricane warnings were issued for the Big Island in preparation for the imminent landfall. As Madeline approached, somewhat weaker than expected, a state of emergency was declared for the entire state of Hawaii still, with dozens of emergency shelters opening on the Big Island. Public schools were closed through September 1 due to the hurricane, and officials advised to stay off any roads and remain indoors if possible. Madeline brought less damage then expected, mainly due to its southward jog and missing the state as a tropical storm, however, areas of Hawaii still experienced heavy rainfall, flooding, storm surge and gusty winds at times.  Meteorological history  On August 22, the National Hurricane Center began to monitor a broad area of low pressure that formed about 1,000 mi (1,600 km) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Over the next few days, the disturbance gradually organized as it tracked westward across the Pacific. Thunderstorm activity increased early on August 25, and as the disturbance further coalesced into the following day, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Fourteen-E formed at 18:00 UTC on August 26, about 1,125 miles (1,810 km) east-southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii. Convective banding features formed to the west of the cyclone, and the depression was later upgraded to Tropical Storm Madeline at 00:00 UTC on August 27. Moving northwestwards under the influence of being located at the southwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge, Madeline strengthened slowly in an environment of moderate wind shear, before crossing 140¬∞W and entering the Central Pacific basin at 00:00 UTC on August 28, at which point the power of issuing advisories on tropical cyclone was transferred to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. A weakening Hurricane Madeline near Hawaii on August 31, with the much stronger Hurricane Lester to its east Once in the Central Pacific, Madeline changed little in intensity until 03:00 UTC on August 29, at which point Madeline began to undergo a period of rapid intensification as an eye feature developed in an organizing central dense overcast (CDO), and it was upgraded to a hurricane at 09:00 UTC that day. Fueled by warm sea surface temperatures in excess of 27 ¬∞C (81 ¬∞F) and low wind shear, Madeline continued to rapidly strengthen, and by 21:00 UTC, it became a major hurricane ‚Äì the fifth of the season. The hurricane reached its peak intensity as a powerful Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC the next day with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 950 millibars (28.05 inHg). By later that day, however, the cloud presentation of Madeline began to degrade as wind shear increased slightly due to an upper- level trough that was located near Hawaii, and by mid-day on August 30, as shown by an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft, the hurricane fell below major hurricane intensity by early on August 31 as it approached Hawaii. Further weakening occurred and six hours later it had weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. The eye later disappeared from satellite and reconnaissance data indicated that the low and mid-level centers were beginning to become elongated. Later that day, the circulation became exposed from the convection as wind shear continued to impact the cyclone, and it eventually weakened to a tropical storm by early on September 1. The deepest convection was pushed to the northeast of the center. Despite favorable sea surface temperatures, the wind shear continued to take its toll on Madeline, and although a new burst of convection over the center flared, the tropical storm continued to further deteriorate in structure. Eventually, by late on September 2, Madeline opened up into a trough of low pressure south-southwest of Hawaii.  Preparations and impact  Rainbow infrared satellite loop of Madeline making its closest approach to Hawaii on September 1 As Madeline rapid intensified on August 29, posing a great threat to Hawaii, a hurricane watch was issued for Hawaii County. A tropical storm warning and a tropical storm watch was issued for Hawaii County and Maui County respectively on the next day as Madeline moved closer to Hawaii. The CPHC issued a hurricane warning for Hawaii County later that day, the first since Iselle in 2014. The watches in Maui County was modified to tropical storm warning on August 31. The hurricane warning was lowered to tropical storm warning later that day as Madeline weakened and failed to make a landfall in the state. All warnings were discontinued on September 1 as Madeline weakened and moved away from the islands. Governor of Hawaii David Ige declared a state of emergency on August 30 as Madeline approached, subsequently citing that an emergency relief period be in effect from August 31 to September 9, in preparation of a possible impact from Hurricane Lester. More than a dozen emergency shelters were opened by the American Red Cross of Hawaii to offer food, water and other essential supplies. All public schools were closed on the Big Island through September 1 as Madeline approached. Residents were also strongly advised to stay inside during the storm. The Umauma Bridge (Route 19) was closed in both directions in anticipation of high winds impacting the bridge. Although Madeline did affect the Big Island, it did not make the major landfall that was anticipated by some meteorologists. Instead, a southwards jog of the system caused much less impacts then what were actually anticipated. Still, Madeline produced heavy rain and gusty winds on the Big Island. In multiple locations, wind gusts exceeded 40 mph (65 km/h), the highest reported being in Waimea, which recorded a peak gust of 60 mph (95 km/h). Total rainfall accumulations amounted up to 5‚Äì11 inches (13‚Äì28 cm) across the Big Island. A few low-lying, flood-prone roads in Hilo were inundated briefly but no significant damages were reported.

Along with Sarah Shepherd Andrews and Hettie Lee Ewing, other single missionaries, she contributed greatly to the setting up of permanent Japanese congregations of the Churches of Christ.  Early life  Lillie Cypert was the daughter of Eli Newton Cypert and Euphamia Cable. Her father died when Lillie was four and her mother remarried James Franklin Dyer. Altogether Cypert had ten siblings, six from her mother‚Äôs second marriage. After attending Freed-Hardeman College (now Freed-Hardeman University) in Henderson, Tennessee, Cypert returned to Searcy County, Arkansas, to teach school.  Life as a missionary  Cypert was introduced to missionary work and Japan in particular while at Freed-Hardeman. In the fall of 2016 she contacted J.M McCaleb about her desire to volunteer as a missionary in Japan. Cypert‚Äôs physician reported favorably on her health, an important quality for a missionary. Support of fifty dollars a month was sought from churches in Tennessee, Cypert sailed for Japan on October 5, 1917, arriving on October 25, 1917. Lillie Cypert joined Sarah Shepherd Andrews in Tokyo, teaching in a boys‚Äô boarding school run by J. M. McCaleb. They also taught Bible classes and English classes. Cypert served as the matron of a girls‚Äô school from its opening in Dec. 1918 until it closed in 1920. According to reports in the publication Word and Work Cypert struggled with finances, particularly because her sponsoring congregation changed a number of times, including several in Texas. During a furlough home in 1922, she taught at the Abilene Mexican Mission. Missionaries returned home on furloughs every five to seven years. In addition to recuperating their health, missionaries were expected to recruit additional missionaries and to raise funds by sharing their experience in talks at churches and college campuses. Returning to Japan in December 1923, Lillie Cypert was in charge of the Zoshigaya Sunday School, and continued to teach Bible, English cooking, and sewing classes. She opened a kindergarten on Sept. 15, 1924. Early in 1925 opened a girls‚Äô boarding school in Zoshigaya which she later turned over to McCaleb. In 1927 Cypert began a children‚Äôs Bible school and ladies Bible class in Kichijoji, eight miles away. In April 1929 she opened a kindergarten there.. This kindergarten was so successful a new wing was added in 1935. Following a 1928 visit to Japan, George Pepperdine began a ‚Äúmission extension fund‚Äù which provided Cypert with forty-five dollars a month. Cypert spent Oct. 28, 1930 through the spring of 1932 visiting her supporting churches, trying to raise funds during the difficult days of the Great Depression. Her visits to churches in Denton, Texas, are recorded in the local paper. In 1938 and 1939, Cypert had health issues, including trachoma, a probably stroke, high blood pressure, and teeth problems.  Return to the United States  Lille Cypert was one of four single Restoration Movement female missionaries who had not left Japan before the start of World War II; all of the men and their families had left. Cypert was taken to the Shinjuku prisoner of war camp in Tokyo. She was returned to the United States as part of an exchange of civilians, leaving Japan on Sept. 13, 1943 and arriving in New York on December 1, 1943. During the remainder of the war she worked as a Japanese interpreter in an Arkansas relocation camp. Cypert next moved to Los Angeles but health issues caused her to join her sister in Porterville, California in 1950 where she died on August 13, 1954.

While most of the site has been reclaimed by nature, the ruins of the United Kansas Portland Cement Company plant can still be seen today in the woods along the eastern shore of Elk City Lake. History Le Hunt can trace its origins back to 1905, when the United Kansas Portland Cement Company purchased 1500 acres a few miles northwest of Independence, Kansas and built a large factory. To accommodate the factory's many workers, a company town was established by United Kansas Portland Cement Company. The town was named after Leigh Hunt, the president of the Hunt engineering company of Michigan that had worked to construct the plant.Ratzlaff (1996), p. 276. By 1906, the fledgling town was home to over 1000 individuals, and around this time, Tom Mix (who would go on to be a famous American film actor and the star of many early Western movies) served as the small town's marshal. Following its establishment, the United Kansas Portland Cement Company suffered several years of financial issues, largely due to the failings of the Kansas cement industry. In 1913, the local newspaper announced that the plant would be temporarily closed to make repairs and sell its surplus stock. By January 1914, the company filed for bankruptcy. In 1915, the plant was purchased by the Sunflower Portland Cement Company.Ratzlaff (1996), pp. 28083. Following World War I, price fluctuations caused the Sunflower Portland Cement Company to be purchased in 1918 by its rival, the Western States Portland Cement Company, which after a series of mergers and purchases, became a part of the United States Steel Corporation. These events led to the Le Hunt plant closing, its equipment being sold off, many of the homes located in Le Hunt being moved elsewhere. With limited housing and no major company to anchor the settlement, Le Hunt faded until it was nothing more than a derelict ghost town.Ratzlaff (1996), p. 285. Today, ruins of the cement plant still remain in the woods off County Road 5000. Most prominent is the factory's long-abandoned smoke stack, which rises above the tree line. According to Legends of America, \\"While trees and weeds try to choke out where the town's cement plant once stood, the walls, ovens and giant smokestack of the factory are still remarkably intact.\\" Ruins of old houses as well as the settlements cemetery are also present, but they have largely been reclaimed by nature.

History Solavers Castle in the early 19th century Solavers Castle was originally built as a fortified church probably during the Early Middle Ages. The church of the Blessed Virgin was the parish church for the villages of Seewis and Fanas. Originally, the church was protected on the north-west side by a long curtain wall and on the other sides by the steep hillside. This wall was modified often during the following centuries. The original gate in the center of the wall was sealed up and a new gate built further from the church at some point. Possibility as early as the 11th century the fortified church and refuge castle became a nobleman's castle. In the 11th or 12th century a square tower was built on the southern side of the hill top. Nothing is known about the first noblemen at Solavers. In the 13th century, the castle was acquired by the Lords of Aspermont. They controlled the lower Pr√§ttigau valley from Solavers and the upper valley from Castels Castle in Luzein. By the early 14th century the Aspermont family was in financial difficulties and in 1338 sold the Pr√§ttigau valley to the von Matsch family and the Counts of Toggenburg. In 1344 the Matsch and Toggenburg families divided their estates with Toggenburg receiving Solavers. The last count, Frederick VII may have been born at Solavers. His death in 1436, led to the creation of the League of the Ten Jurisdictions which was a confederation of ten communities in the region which sought freedom from foreign overlords. Frederick VII's death also started the Toggenburg War and a long running dispute over the inheritance of the castle. Perhaps due to the disputed succession and the local residents' hostility to foreign rulers, the castle was abandoned in the mid 15th century. Eventually, the Emperor ruled that Solavers was to be combined with the Herrschaft of Belfort under Wilhelm IV von Montfort and Heinrich von Sax-Misox. Though the castle appears to have been abandoned before the succession was sorted out. Later they sold the territory to Duke Sigismund of Austria, over the objections of the League which opposed the Austrian Habsburgs. The castle church remained in operation for about a century after the castle was abandoned. In the 15th century the nave was lengthened and a polygonal chancel was added. In 1472 the Church of St. Lawrence in Seewis village became the parish church for the area. However, in 1487 the communities of Seewis and Fanas agreed to continue holding their major church festivals in Solavers. In the 16th century, when the Protestant Reformation took hold in the Pr√§ttigau, the church was abandoned. Castle site Ruins of Solvares Castle The church was built on the highest point of a steep hill outside the village of Seewis. A long curtain wall stretching along the north-west side of the hilltop protected the church. The wall is up to thick in the center, tapering down to only on the sides. It was built and modified multiple times over the centuries, with several sealed entrances still visible. When the fortified church was converted into a feudal castle, a ring wall was built around the west and southern sides of the hill top along with a tower. The tower, on the south side, was about . Next to the castle there was a residence wing. Today only parts of the tower remain along with two pointed arch windows. The church of the Blessed Virgin was built as a Romanesque building. In the 15th century the nave was extended and a Gothic choir was added. The pointed arch window is well preserved.

The palace is characterized by rich ornamental decorations, a reference to the art of the Greeks and Romans. The building was founded by Magdalena Morska of the Dzieduszycki family, built in the years 1798-1812. History Magdalena Morska initiated a new period in the history of Zarzecze. After visiting France, England, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, but primarily the Netherlands, Magdalena Morska had the opportunity to learn about other cultures coming from all over the world in the two largest royal ports, namely Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Mrs Morska was charmed by the environment (especially trees) in Zarzecze and indeed wanted to build a rural residence there. Thanks to this new experience, gained over the North Sea, Magdalena organized the reconstruction of manor house in Zarzecze and its immediate surroundings, in part by changing the spatial layout of the village. After completing the project by Fryderyk Bauman and Christian Peter Aygnera - the creator of one of the wings of the National Theatre, it was created the palace in the Empire style to which Mrs Morska designed the interior herself and brought exotic flowers, shrubs, vines and trees to decorate the park in the romantic style. Mrs Magdalena also reinvented the oxbow lake Mleczka transforming by building an artificial island, thus increasing the aesthetic value of the palace complex. After the death of Magdalena Morska (who died without any heirs), Zarzecze was passed to her relatives ‚Äì the Dzieduszycki family. The property belonged to the family until 1944, but in that year under the decree on that land, the Dzieduszycki family was deprived of their possessions and thrown out of the property. In the 80's, the decaying palace complex was renovated. In 2007, ZwiƒÖzek Rodowy Dzieduszyckich signed an agreement with the local authorities and began the creation of the Dzieduszycki Museum within the palace. The family signed a notary deed which waived rights and claims to the palace and park complex in favor of the emerging institution. Interior of the palace Three rooms on the first floor were restored to the original design from the early nineteenth century. The particular rooms resemble the history of the palace and of the former owners. In the corridor there is a collection of drawings depicting the appearance of the palace from the early 19th century and gallery of the members of the family. There is a room with temporary exhibitions, geological room in which there is a family tree and photographs of old ancestral headquarters, archives and publications on the palace and its former inhabitants. Visitors are particularly impressed by the ballroom in the rotunda. It is a room with incredible furniture and fixtures and the original parquet floor is made of several types of wood. One room is devoted to the first entailer, W≈Çodzimierz Dzieduszycki. His descendants are presented in ‚Äúgallery hall‚Äù on the first floor. The portraits of the representatives of three families: Czartoryski, the Sapieha and Szeptycki families, which are related to the Dzieduszyccy, and are presented on the ground floor. The co-funders of the Museum, which opened on 26 April 2008, are the authorities of the Zarzecze Commune.

In this article, an example of such a filter using finite impulse response is discussed and an application of the filter into real world data is shown.  FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Linear filters  In digital processing, an FIR filter is a time-continuous filter that is invariant with time. This means that the filter does not depend on the specific point of time, but rather depends on the time duration. The specification of this filter uses a transfer function which has a frequency response which will only pass the desired frequencies of the input. This type of filter is non-recursive, which means that the output can be completely derived at from a combination of the input without any recursive values of the output. This means that there is no feedback loop that feeds the new output the values of previous outputs. This is an advantage over recursive filters such as IIR filter (Infinite Impulse Response) in the applications that require a linear phase response because it will pass the input without a phase distortion.IIR Filters and FIR Filters.

The mathematical model of this type of filter is: : y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} x(t-\\\\tau)\\\\, h(\\\\tau)\\\\, d\\\\tau h(\\\\tau) is a transfer function of an impulse response to the input. The convolution allows the filter to only be activated when the input recorded a signal at the same time value. This filter returns the input values (x(t)) if k falls into the support region of function h. This is the reason why this filter is called finite response. If k is outside of the support region, the impulse response is zero which makes output zero. The central idea of this h(\\\\tau) function can be thought of as a quotient of two functions.Nagai, N. (1990). Linear circuits, systems, and signal processing: Advanced theory and applications. New York: M. Dekker. According to Huang (1981)Huang, T. S. (1981). Topics in applied physics: Two-Dimensional Digital Signal Processing I (3rd ed., Vol. 42, Topics in Applied Physics). Berlin: Springer. Using this mathematical model, there are four methods of designing non-recursive linear filters with various concurrent filter designs: # Window design method # Frequency Sampling method # Conventional linear programming # Iterative linear programming  Single-sided Linear Filter  = Input function = Define the input signal: : y(t) = \\\\sin(t) + rand(\\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 200\\\\end{bmatrix}) rand(\\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 200\\\\end{bmatrix}) adds a random number from 1 to 200 to the sinusoidal function which serves to distort the data. Sine with random function = Single-sided filter = Use an exponential function as the impulse response for the support region of positive values. :h(t) = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & \\\\forall &-\\\\infty &\\\\le & t &\\\\le 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{-t}, \\\\quad & \\\\forall &0 &\\\\le & t &\\\\le +\\\\infty \\\\end{cases} The frequency response of this filer resembles a low-pass filter as in the lower frequency. Single sided filter frequency response Single-sided filtering result  Double-sided filter  Let the input signal to be the same as the single-sided function. Use an exponential function as the impulse response for the support region of positive values as before. In this double-sided filter, also implement another exponential function. The opposite in signs of the powers of the exponent is to maintain the non-infinite results when computing the exponential functions. h(t) = \\\\begin{cases} e^{t}, & \\\\forall & -\\\\infty &\\\\le & t &\\\\le 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{-t}, &\\\\forall & 0 &\\\\le &t; &\\\\le +\\\\infty \\\\end{cases} Examine this filter in its frequency domain, we see that the magnitude response is the same trend as the single sided filter. However, the frequencies that can be passed are smaller than those of the single-sided filter. This resulted in a smoother output. The significant of this consequence is that the double-sided filters types of linear filters are better being a filter. Double-sided filter frequency response Double-sided filtering result  FIR Transfer function Linear filter Application  Linear filter performs better when it is a double-sided filter. This requires the data to be known in advance which makes it a challenge for these filters to function well in situations where signals cannot be known ahead of time such as radio signal processing. However, this means that linear filters are extremely useful in filtering pre-loaded data. In addition, because of its non-recursive nature which preserves the phase angles of the input, linear filters are usually used in image processing, video processing, data processing or pattern detection. Some examples are image enhancement, restoration and pre-whitening for spectral analysis.Huang, T. S. (1981). Topics in applied physics: Two-Dimensional Digital Signal Processing I (3rd ed., Vol. 42, Topics in Applied Physics). Berlin: Springer. Additionally, linear non-recursive filters are always stable and usually produce a purely real output which makes them more favorable. They are also computationally easy which usually creates a big advantage for using this FIR linear filter.

There is no common name for this fish yet. L. beroe can be found on dead coral rubble, Lophelia pertusa, deep in the ocean and is often just resting and not swimming, which makes this a lie in wait predator. There are no threats that have been found at this time but further research is needed to fully understand this species.  Description  L. beroe has a maximum length of 40 cm. They have 19 vertebrae with 6 anal spines and rays. One of the best identifying markers are the white humoral spots that are only visible on live specimens‚Äîonce the specimen is preserved, the spots disappear. Larvae of this species are hard to find due to the depths that these fish lay eggs at. The larvae have small pectoral fins and the spines protrude a lot with a fleshy base with slight flaps.  Distribution  L. beroe can be found in most of the Atlantic Ocean, ranging from North Carolina to the northern coast of South America; it is also found in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. The fish are found at depths ranging from 370 to 860 meters at temperatures of 9 to 11 degrees Celsius.  References  * Richards, William J.

Traditional markets held in a town or village are events that are both a celebration of local identity, and a collective ceremony in which everyone is both the participant and spectator, as well as a meeting place where everyone is equal and no one is excluded. Tourism and tradition Very often, the traditional markets ‚Äì some date from the Middle Ages ‚Äì occupied squares and little streets and their main goal was to channel the provision of food supplies in towns and villages and to keep informed as well. With the rise of mass tourism during the 20th century the festival of colours and smells provided by the local fruits and vegetables, as well as spices and Herbes de Provence, itself became an attraction. Summer season In the summer, the traditional holiday period, one will find tomatoes, peppers, lettuces, black and green olives, onions, apricots, peaches, figs, grapes, etc., not to forget local produce such as the Cavaillon melon, candied fruits from Apt, calissons from Aix, nougat from Sault, strawberries from Carpentras or fish from the coasts. The Proven√ßal market also offers local specialities such as essential oils of lavender from Haute-Provence, cut and dried flowers, and all kinds of soap products. Finally, it is also the chance to discover truffles, lavender honey, cordials, jams, olives, designation of origin oils and fine wines from the Rhone Valley and Provence.

It was the first lighthouse to be built on the island. It was first lit on 7 July 1860 and was automated and de-staffed in 1986. Origin The wreck of the merchant ship Lord Ashburton in 1857 on the northern tip of Grand Manan, with the loss of 21 lives, led the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly to call for \\"a Light House to be erected on the Northern Head of Grand Manan\\". The site chosen was a headland called the \\"Swallow's Tail\\" near the entrance to the harbour at North Head. The lighthouse tower and keeper's dwelling were built in 1859 at a cost of ¬£495 and the lantern was first lit on 7 July 1860. It was the first lighthouse to be built on the island of Grand Manan. Infrastructure The light was originally provided by nine lamps and reflectors, which were later increased to ten. In 1887 a lens replaced the lamps and reflectors. In 1907 a fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed, providing 360¬∞ coverage. A wooden tower was built in 1914 to house a fog bell. The fog bell tower was moved in 1920 to a position closer to the lighthouse. In 1958 a new keeper's house was built, replacing the original dwelling. In the 1960s the lighthouse keeper had a boathouse moved from another lighthouse to the Swallowtail light station. In 1980 the fog bell was removed and put on display at the Grand Manan Museum. The lighthouse was automated and de-staffed in 1986. Significance The lighthouse, which is visible from the ferry as it approaches and leaves the terminus at North Head, has been called \\"the island's signature vista\\". It has regularly featured in New Brunswick tourism materials and has been recognized by the federal government as \\"a long-standing symbol of the maritime heritage of the region\\". Conservation The village of North Head purchased the de-staffed but still operational light station's land and buildings, other than the lighthouse tower, from the federal government in 1994. In 1996 it became the property of the newly amalgamated village of Grand Manan. The lighthouse keeper's residence was used as a bed and breakfast for several years, closing in 2004. In 2008 the village council announced plans to sell the house, but reversed the decision in the face of the community's negative response. An organization called Save Swallowtail was formed in order to clean up and repair the building. In 2009 the village leased the keeper's house to the organization, which had become the Swallowtail Keepers Society, for 20 years. In 2010, Swallowtail light was included on a list of 976 lighthouses declared \\"surplus\\" by the Canadian Coast Guard. The Swallowtail Keepers Society undertook to acquire and maintain the lighthouse and remaining property, and received a $55,000 grant from the New Brunswick government at a ceremony marking the Swallowtail's 150th anniversary. In 2012 the fog bell, which had been housed at the Grand Manan Museum since 1980, was returned to the site, where it is displayed on a new wooden deck near the keeper's house. The Swallowtail Keepers Society took over the lighthouse property in July 2013. Later that year, federal, provincial and municipal government grants and community fundraising resulted in over $200,000 \\"to build a boardwalk, improve the footbridge, produce marketing materials and cover project administrative costs at the iconic lighthouse\\".

Widemann and nephew Charlie Berger, 1886 Wilhelmine Kekelaokalaninui Widemann Dowsett (March 28, 1861 ‚Äì December 10, 1929) was a Native Hawaiian suffragist who helped organize the National Women's Equal Suffrage Association of Hawaii, the first women's suffrage club in the Territory of Hawaii in 1912. She actively campaigned for the rights of the women of Hawaii to vote prior to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920.  Early life and family  She was born on March 28, 1861, at Lihue, Kauai, the daughter of German immigrant and businessman Hermann A. Widemann and his Hawaiian wife Mary Kaumana Pilahiuilani. There was some disagreement about the exact royal descent of her mother after her death, although her mother's grandfather Kalawa was a retainer of the ali ªi of Kauai. Her father was a prominent politician of the Kingdom of Hawaii and a cabinet minister of the last queen Lili ªuokalani. On April 30, 1888, she married John \\"Jack\\" McKibbin Dowsett (1862‚Äì1929), a grandson of the British Captain Samuel James Dowsett who settled in Hawaii in 1828. Their wedding at the St. Andrew's Cathedral in Honolulu was attended by members of the Hawaiian Royal Family including King KalƒÅkaua, Queen Kapi ªolani, Princesses Lili ªuokalani and Ka ªiulani. Her husband became a successful businessman with interests in banking, fire insurance, the sugar industry and interisland steamers and became the largest shareholder of Waianae Sugar Company. He served as a Republican Senator in the Hawaii Territorial Legislature from 1905 to 1907 and served as an official on the Board of Agriculture and Foresty and the Board of Prison Inspectors. They had three children: Herbert Melville Kualii (1890‚Äì1969), Frank Llewellyn Lunalilo (1891‚Äì1962), and Alice Aileen Kekuiapoiwa Liliha (1898‚Äì1983).  Women's suffrage in Hawaii  After the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, she became a prominent leader of the women's suffrage. The enfranchisement of the women of California, Oregon and Washington in the 1910s contributed to an increased interest in the movement in Hawaii. In 1912, at the request of the women of Honolulu, Dowsett organized the National Women's Equal Suffrage Association of Hawaii (WESAH), the first local women's suffrage club. The group insisted on being referred to as suffragists rather than suffragettes, which carried with it the negative association with the militant British movement. Its constitution was modeled after the National Woman Suffrage Association with Dowsett as the president. Carrie Chapman Catt, visiting from the mainland, was invited to speak with the group on October 28, 1918 and contributed to the growing interest. The Honolulu Star-Bulletin noted: > The Hawaiian women are anxious to vote and they are ready to do all they can > to gain equal suffrage. One of the members said yesterday that up to the > present time the native women have not known just what steps to take and > therefore have made no progress but she said that with Mrs. Dowsett as the > president they feel that the cause will surely advance. All of the members > are anxious to be active and want to arouse Interest among all of the women > in the city irrespective of nationality. Wealthy women of Native Hawaiian and biracial descents like Dowsett, Emma Ahuena Davison Taylor and Emma NƒÅwahƒ´ were the initial leaders of this movement while women of Euro-American descent (i.e. the \\"missionary set\\") were less inclined to support the cause due to concern about the increased enfranchisement of non-white female voters. During a meeting of the organization with local politicians in 1913, Dowsett argued that women were superior to men, stating: > I can speak for my Hawaiian sisters, and I can say that in every way the > woman is man's superior. She will not only cast her vote fully as > intelligently‚Äîshe will vote, honestly. There isn't enough money in the world > to buy her vote. And on the jury she will decide as intelligently, while > there will be no question as to her verdict.\\" The major obstacle to female enfranchisement was the Organic Act which established the Territory of Hawaii and specifically forbid the territorial legislature from granting suffrage contrary to the federal constitution unlike most other state constitutions. With the assistance of suffragist leaders on the mainland such as Almira Hollander Pitman and Catt, Hawaiian suffragist leaders and their allies were able to push an act, ignored up to that point, through Congress granting Hawaii the power to decide on the issue. In 1919, a bill granting the vote to women in the Territory was being discussed in the legislature. The Senate passed the bill but it found opposition in the House. It became deadlocked due to disagreement within the two bodies about whether the bill would take into effect in the primary election of 1919 or 1920. On March 6, 1919, Dowsett called a mass meeting the women of WESAH which adopted a resolution demanding the right to vote for women in the upcoming primary and regular election. The House instead introduced another bill which would further delay the issue of the vote and relegate the matter to a referendum on the issue. On March 23, Dowsett and Louise MacMillan, a WESAH officer representing Hawaii Island, rallied nearly 500 women of \\"various nationalities, of all ages\\". This group stormed the floor of the House, carrying a huge banner with the message \\"Votes for Women\\". The following day, the House held a two-hour hearing on the issue of women suffrage and invited both supporters and opponents to speak. Dowsett and MacMillan held a large gathering at  ªA ªala Park to press their cause to the people. Speakers and participants included Elizabeth Kahanu Kalaniana ªole, Lahilahi Webb, former First Lady Mary Dillingham Frear, and Mary Ha ªaheo Atcherley. Dowsett made a tour of the other Hawaiian Islands in an attempt to get more popular support for the bill's passing. The bill never passed because the following year Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment, granting all women in the United States the right to vote.  Wartime knitting units  During World War I, Dowsett served as president of the Hawaiian Knitting Unit formed in March 1918 while her sister Emilie Widemann Macfarlane and her friend Emma Ahuena Taylor were to the first to organize knitting units on behalf of Native Hawaiian soldiers and servicemen abroad. Historian Rumi Yasutake argued that Native Hawaiians of German descents such as Dowsett and her sisters felt political pressure from both their paternal connections to the German Empire, the wartime enemy of the United States, and the anti-annexation activities they participated in the past. Thus they channeled their wartime efforts into helping Native Hawaiian servicemen.  Death and legacy  Dowsett died at Honolulu on December 10, 1929, shortly after her husband's death on September 1 of the same year. She was described as an \\"invalid\\" for the last year of her life.; ; ; Following a private funeral, her cremated remains were buried next to her husband at the Oahu Cemetery. Her grave marker records her name as \\"Wilhelmine Widemann Dowsett.\\" In 2020, Dowsett was named an honoree of the National Women's History Alliance.

The branches of microbiology can be classified into pure and applied sciences. Microbiology can be also classified based on taxonomy, in the cases of bacteriology, mycology, protozoology, and phycology. There is considerable overlap between the specific branches of microbiology with each other and with other disciplines, and certain aspects of these branches can extend beyond the traditional scope of microbiologyhttp://www.generalmicroscience.com/microbiology/branches-of- microbiology/ In general the field of microbiology can be divided in the more fundamental branch (pure microbiology) and the applied microbiology (biotechnology). In the more fundamental field the organisms are studied as the subject itself on a deeper (theoretical) level. Applied microbiology refers to the fields where the micro-organisms are applied in certain processes such as brewing or fermentation. The organisms itself are often not studied as such, but applied to sustain certain processes. Pure microbiology * Bacteriology: the study of bacteria * Mycology: the study of fungi * Protozoology: the study of protozoa * Phycology/algology: the study of algae * Parasitology: the study of parasites * Immunology: the study of the immune system * Virology: the study of viruses * Nematology: the study of nematodes * Microbial cytology: the study of microscopic and submicroscopic details of microorganisms * Microbial physiology: the study of how the microbial cell functions biochemically. Includes the study of microbial growth, microbial metabolism and microbial cell structure * Microbial ecology: the relationship between microorganisms and their environment * Microbial genetics: the study of how genes are organized and regulated in microbes in relation to their cellular functions Closely related to the field of molecular biology * Cellular microbiology: a discipline bridging microbiology and cell biology * Evolutionary microbiology: the study of the evolution of microbes. This field can be subdivided into: ** Microbial taxonomy: the naming and classification of microorganisms ** Microbial systematics: the study of the diversity and genetic relationship of microorganisms * Generation microbiology: the study of those microorganisms that have the same characters as their parents * Systems microbiology: a discipline bridging systems biology and microbiology. * Molecular microbiology: the study of the molecular principles of the physiological processes in microorganisms * Phylogeny: the study of the genetic relationships between different organismsTalaro, Chess (2015) Foundations in Microbiology Page 21 =Other= * Astro microbiology: the study of microorganisms in outer space * Biological agent: the study of those microorganisms which are being used in weapon industries. * Nano microbiology: the study of those microscopic organisms on nano level. * Predictive microbiology: the quantification of relations between controlling factors in foods and responses of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms using mathematical modelling * Applied microbiology * Medical microbiology: the study of the pathogenic microbes and the role of microbes in human illness. Includes the study of microbial pathogenesis and epidemiology and is related to the study of disease pathology and immunology. This area of microbiology also covers the study of human microbiota, cancer, and the tumor microenvironment. * Pharmaceutical microbiology: the study of microorganisms that are related to the production of antibiotics, enzymes, vitamins, vaccines, and other pharmaceutical products and that cause pharmaceutical contamination and spoil. * Industrial microbiology: the exploitation of microbes for use in industrial processes. Examples include industrial fermentation and wastewater treatment. Closely linked to the biotechnology industry. This field also includes brewing, an important application of microbiology. * Microbial biotechnology: the manipulation of microorganisms at the genetic and molecular level to generate useful products. * Food microbiology: the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage and foodborne illness. Using microorganisms to produce foods, for example by fermentation. * Agricultural microbiology: the study of agriculturally relevant microorganisms. This field can be further classified into the following: ** Plant microbiology and Plant pathology: The study of the interactions between microorganisms and plants and plant pathogens. ** Soil microbiology: the study of those microorganisms that are found in soil. * Veterinary microbiology: the study of the role of microbes in veterinary medicine or animal taxonomy. * Environmental microbiology: the study of the function and diversity of microbes in their natural environments.

The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist Senen Reyes, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Rogelio \\"Roy\\" Lozano, rhythm guitarist and vocalist Billy Graziadei, and bassist and backing vocalist Christian Olde Wolbers. History The band's history can be traced back to the 1990s, where the band members would often collaborate - such as Senen \\"Sen Dog\\" Reyes and Billy Biohazard performing on Biohazard's State Of The World Address album with the hit single How it is, or Wolbers and Lozano appearing in Cypress Hill albums Skull & Bones and Stoned Raiders. In 2015, Roy Lozano played some demos to Senen Reyes on a ride to the airport, setting the foundations for Powerflo. The name of the band comes from a comment Lozano made about Reyes's vocal tracking for the upcoming album. Describing their sound as a \\"cross between Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath and Cypress Hill\\", they first unveiled the band on March 1, 2017 while recording their self-titled debut album. On May 2, 2017, they released the first single \\"Resistance\\" via Metal Injection. In launching the first single, Reyes indicated that this is a long term project and that future Powerflo albums will be released after their self-titled Produced by Billy Graziadei and Josh Lynch is released, while also announcing a June 23 release date. On June 2, 2017, Powerflo released their next music video (directed by Graziadei) for \\"Victims of Circumstance\\", a song influenced by the TV series The First 48. At the same time, they announced their first show at The Viper Room in Los Angeles on June 15. On May 31, \\"Resistance\\" was chosen as the official theme song for WWE NXT's programming. In July, 2017 Powerflo released another video for the single Where I Stay (directed by Jeremy Danger and Travis Shinn) which quickly reached over 1 million views within weeks of release. The band spent the summer and fall touring with friends from San Diego P.O.D. and LA family Brujeria Powerflo released the next video for Less than Human (directed by Graziadei) in December 2017 and went on tour with Prong in the spring of 2018.

History It originally functioned as a residence, within a block of tenement houses numbering from 30 to 38. The owner of the building at that time - Count Ksawery Branicki - initiated the division of the Branicki Palace Gardens in hopes of creating a representative urban development. The building is situated in Warsaw‚Äôs most charming and picturesque neighborhood, in proximity to Nowy ≈öwiat Street, Royal Route and Three Crosses Square. The design of the building was assigned to valued architect Bronis≈Çaw Brochowicz- Rogoyski, who also developed an attractive array of tenement houses on Foksal street, the main building of the Warsaw University of Technology, and the first high-rise construction in Warsaw - the \\"PAST\\" building. In 1944 the building was bombed by German forces and robbed. After WWII the building was reconstructed, based on preserved plans and photographs, however it was no longer owned by the Branicki family. Since October 1945 the entire property, pursuant to Bierut Decree, along with the impressive family fortune, was nationalized. For a short period of time, the office of the First Secretary of PZPR Boles≈Çaw Bierut was located here. From the 1970s until the reclaiming of the building by the Count Branicki's heirs, it served as headquarter of the Union of Socialist Polish Youth (ZSMP).

He is also an educator, on faculty at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.  Early life and education  David Garner was born in South Side, Chicago. He spent most of his childhood in Lincoln, Nebraska and Lake Oswego, Oregon upon his parents‚Äô relocations for academic positions. He was given piano and cello lessons throughout his childhood and performed in recitals and with youth orchestras. Garner attended UCLA as a Classics major for two years before deciding that music was a better match. He left in 1974 and returned home to Oregon where he pursued music privately, playing blues, rock fusion, and classical piano while he prepared to audition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music for the piano performance program. He was originally rejected from the program and spent six months as an adult extension student before auditioning again and being accepted in 1976. He would complete his degree in piano performance in 1979.  Career  = Teaching career = Concurrent with his graduating from the San Francisco Conservatory, Garner was appointed to the faculty as a part-time theory instructor, becoming full-time in 1984 when he was also named Chairman of the Musicianship and Theory Department. He remained in that position until 2000, when he elected to take a position in the Composition Department. He has remained in that position since and currently teaches composition, chamber music, and theory. = Composition career = Garner began composing in his youth, and has never had a lesson in composition. His body of work covers a wide variety of instrumentation, with his most prolific content being produced for the voice. He has produced a continuous output of compositional work since the early 1980s, shortly after becoming a faculty member at the San Francisco Conservatory. Garner‚Äôs compositions have won multiple awards and grants, including First Place for the American Prize in Composition in 2015 and two Silver Medals from the Global Music Awards for Spoon River Songs and Surviving: Women‚Äôs Words. Garner developed a compositional technique for his String Quartet No. 2 which he calls Tonal Serialism. He describes it as ‚Äúa method of musical composition that uses precepts of the 12-tone techniques developed by Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School with one important difference: where ‚Äòclassical serialism‚Äô seeks to obscure tonal centricity and favor ‚Äòfree‚Äô tonality, tonal serialism preserves harmonic and structural elements of traditional tonal music, most notably a purposeful gravitation toward a tonal center through the coincidence of vertical consonance and dissonance.‚Äù Garner‚Äôs work is frequently commissioned by performers and organizations, and his compositions have been recorded on the Centaur and Pentatone labels, in addition to self-produced recordings and a release produced by Quadre Music Group. He is also the resident composer for Ensemble for These Times, a chamber music group whose work focuses on contemporary repertoire.  Operas  Mary Pleasant at Land‚Äôs End is Garner‚Äôs first full-length opera, composed of two acts and set to a libretto by Mark Hernandez, also an alumnus of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. The work was commissioned by Opera Parall√®le. The opera gives an account of Mary Ellen Pleasant, a daughter of slaves who assisted with the Underground Railroad before moving West to San Francisco‚Äôs Barbary Coast. The opera explores Pleasant‚Äôs significance as an integral part of the founding of San Francisco and the state of California, as she fought to ensure the civil rights of black settlers. According to librettist Mark Hernandez, the opera ‚Äútraces much of Pleasant‚Äôs astonishing life, beginning with her days as a shepherd for the Underground Railroad. Arriving in San Francisco, she becomes a beloved leader in the young city. Eventually, this daughter of slaves stands as one of the richest and most influential individuals of the time. Her championing of people and causes, however, brings her into conflict with a more familiar face of wealth and power, and the ensuing struggle plays out in a notorious courtroom drama that mesmerizes the public. Sensationalist press coverage demonizes Pleasant, playing on attitudes towards her race and gender. An essential figure in the founding of San Francisco, and indeed the state of California, she is forgotten even as the city bursts into world prominence.‚Äù Set in the 1880s, Mary Pleasant at Land‚Äôs End is composed of two acts (approximately two hours of music total), and calls for four principal artists, six comprimario artists, and mixed chorus. The music is replete with the soaring vocalism for which Garner is so widely admired. He uses an eclectic mix of musical styles, including quotes from popular music of the 1870s and 1880s, along with a large amount of percussion and ostinato. Much of the percussion employs traditional drumming patterns of the Caribbean, which Garner uses to represent the four major characters. Hernandez‚Äôs libretto draws on language and circumstances of the time, drawing on the historical perspective gathered in Lynn M. Hudson‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúThe Making of ‚ÄòMammy Pleasant‚Äô.‚Äù Hernandez ‚Äúfelt it was important that it be as [historically] accurate as possible.‚Äù A full workshop of the opera was presented on January 14, 2017 at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. The opera is slated to be the first major opera to come out of a conservatory for more than 100 years. Garner‚Äôs previous operas include Daughter of Night (2010), and The Money Tree (1999), both one-act operas.  Songs and vocal music  Music involving the voice makes up the majority of Garner‚Äôs works. In this genre, Garner has been consistently lauded for his careful attention to setting text, his skill described as ‚Äúgetting to the semantic core of each of the poems he has set.‚Äù His eclectic background in musical styles informs his accompaniments, displaying rhythmic and melodic elements which support the texts of his pieces. He has written for a cappella voice, voice and piano, voice and chamber ensemble, and for choral ensembles. Co-founder of the chamber group Ensemble for These Times, Garner composed four song cycles as part of their Jewish Music & Poetry Project: Chanson f√ºr Morgen (2011‚Äì12), Ph√∂nix (2013), Song is a Monument (2014), and Mein blaues Klavier (2015). The cycles were recorded by the ensemble under the project name Surviving: Women‚Äôs Words, released on Centaur Records in April 2016. From 2007 to 2013, he worked with Iranian American soprano Raeeka Shehabi-Yaghmai to compose piano accompaniments and orchestrations of Persian melodies for the Persian Melody Project. Yaghmai purposely sought out Garner as someone who would merge the sound and techniques of Western composition to the melodies originating in the Middle East. The Project has currently produced eighteen songs, with five pieces receiving their orchestrated world premiere with Oakland East Bay Symphony in 2008. Ten of the songs accompanied by piano have been recorded and slated for CD release in 2017. Garner‚Äôs work Phenomenal Woman was commissioned by Kathleen Sisco in 2004 and appears on Garner‚Äôs CD Phenomenon: The Music of David Garner, on the Pentatone Classics label. The work was performed by Lisa Delan in May 2010 for Jazz at Lincoln Center.  Instrumental music  Garner‚Äôs instrumental music includes works for solo and duo piano, chamber music, and orchestral music. His String Quartet No. 2 was commissioned by the 2014 San Francisco-Shanghai International Chamber Music Festival. The piece won the 2015 American Prize in Composition in the Chamber Music Professional Division. His first quartet (String Quartet No. 1) was commissioned by the Picasso Quartet and was premiered in 2009.

He worked for various lumbermen, one who was Nelson Ludington a lumber baron that was doing work for a new railroad and harbor. The new harbor was the site of a new town later to be known as the city of Escanaba, Michigan. Royce surveyed the area for a layout of a new town as a pioneer and is considered the founder of Escanaba. There he was a businessman, surveyor, engineer, postmaster, and lawyer as well as their mayor. Early life Royce was born in Clinton, New York, on November 29, 1820. His father, Phinehas Royce, was a Massachusetts-born Quaker. He married Deborah Parsons of Connecticut, who was the daughter of minister Jonathan Parsons, and they had five children. Royce was their fourth son. He received his middle name from the maternal side of the family. Career Royce grew up in Putnam County, New York, where he attended public schools. His parents moved to Ohio with the family when he was fifteen years old. There Royce got a job as a handyman helper to a corps of surveyors that were working in a timber area, west of Oberlin, Ohio. He learned field techniques in the process, such as being able to travel about without the use of a compass and not getting lost. He moved from the Oberlin area to Sandusky, Ohio and had different jobs. One was working at a horse railroad that was commissioned by the city of Sandusky. He worked in the construction and repair work of the railway, which was about miles long. After a year, he moved to Adrian, Michigan. Royce in 1869 During the next three years he worked on the railroad between Adrian and Hillsdale, Michigan. He also taught at a local school for two years. Royce later returned to Sandusky and from there went to Chicago by steamship. He got various jobs in Chicago then from 1840 to 1842. At this time, he became acquainted with William B. Ogden, Chicago's first mayor and worked with him doing surveying. Royce then went to Michigan City, Indiana, and worked surveying the shore of Lake Michigan and building piers. He later returned in mid-1849 to Chicago and was married to Sarah J. Barras, a descendant of Colonel Barras. Sarah was born in the state of New York. They had two children. Royce moved from Chicago to Green Bay, Wisconsin and was employed in surveying for lumbermen. He was in charge of an exploration party which prospected for a railroad to be built west of the Wisconsin River. Royce first explored the Escanaba territory in 1855. In 1861 lumberman Nelson Ludington requested Royce to explore Escanaba for a suitable harbor for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. After doing surveying work for Ludington, he went back to his home in Green Bay. There he studied law and practiced in nearby Oconto, Wisconsin. Royce returned to the Escanaba area in 1862 and started to lay out a town. He laid out the original town as it now stands and had it recorded in the county in 1864. It was originally laid out as 42 blocks west from the bay and five blocks north and south of Ludington Street. Many additions have since been made to the original recorded plat. Royce is the pioneering resident of Escanaba and was known in the Upper Peninsula as a businessman. He held city offices of postmaster, attorney, mayor, and engineer. Royce eventually brought his family to the new town in 1864. Royce had taken an active part in local affairs as a citizen of the new town and is considered by historian Clint Dunathan as the founder of Escanaba, Michigan. He is given the credit for the wide streets of the city he laid out as a surveyor. The name \\"Escanaba\\" means flat rock in the Chippewa language of the indigenous American Indians. The Escanaba River bottom contains many smooth flat rocks made that way by the currents of the river. The name of the town was named after the river that received the Escanaba name first from the local Native Americans. The city of Escanaba is in a narrow strip of land called Sand Point that juts out into a little bay that opens into Lake Michigan's Green Bay. This area was named by the local native American Indians as Weyohquatonk. Death Royce died at the age of 91 on May 26, 1912. He is buried at the Lakeview Cemetery in Escanaba.

Born in Ludingtonville, New York, he made his fortune in the Midwest based on resource exploitation: lumber, iron ore and copper. He bought large tracts of timber land on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where he was associated with the founding of the city of Escanaba. He also had a branch and the main lumber yards in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but eventually based his namesake company in Chicago, Illinois, which became the boom town of the upper Midwest. There he helped found and served as president of the Fifth National Bank of Chicago.  Ancestry  Nelson Ludington family tree showing his ancestors and the complete American family line of the Ludingtons from the progenitor. Ludington's four times great-grandparents William Ludington and his wife Ellen were his immigrant ancestors, progenitors of the American branch of the Ludington family line. William and his wife Ellen, born 1608 and 1617 respectively, emigrated from England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1640, right after they married. They settled in Charlestown, Massachusetts. They had seven children. About 1660 they moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Later generations lived in this area but, after the American Revolutionary War, they began to move into New York state. Ludington's grandfather Henry Ludington moved from Branford, Connecticut, to Putnam County, New York. This frontier settlement was called Ludingtonville after him. It was later known as Kent, New York.  Life  Ludington was born on January 18, 1818, in Ludingtonville in Putnam County, New York. His parents, Frederick Ludington and Susannah (Griffeth) Ludington were farmers. Ludington was the fourth of their sixteen children and received private schooling by tutors for his early education. Ludington took courses at the Tucker Hill Academy as the last part of his formal education. Ludington's training for the business world started at a general store in Cold Spring, New York, a town located along the Hudson River. He later became a clerk in a dry goods store in New York City receiving further training in the retail business. In 1839 he joined his older brother, Harrison Ludington, in the firm Ludington, Burchard and Company, which was owned by his brother, uncle Lewis Ludington, and Harvey Burchard. After two years Nelson Ludington purchased Burchard's share of the business, and changed the name of the firm to Ludington and Company. Ludington was with the business until 1847, when he sold his ownership share to the other partners. Ludington started in the lumber industry with Daniel Wells Jr. and Jefferson Sinclair in 1848, in a new firm called Nelson Ludington & Company (sometimes shortened to N. Ludington & Co.). He recognized that the rapid expansion of western towns around the Great Lakes would increase market demand for lumber, so he bought up large tracts of timber lands in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Ludington constructed various mills to process the lumber and related resources. Escanaba, Michigan (originally called Flat Rock), was one of the places where Ludington established a sawmill. Since he was a pioneer of the area and an early developer, he named the settlement. Locals suggested it be named after the nearby river, known as the \\"Escanawba\\" by the local Ojibwa Indians, referring to the smooth, flat rocks on the river bottom. His hired surveyor, Eli Parsons Royce, entered the name on the town design schematic, as he understood it from a local Indian. Royce spelled it as Escanawba and that was entered with the state in 1863 as the legal name for the town. Pioneers changed it a few years later to \\"Escanaba\\", simplifying the spelling. Ludington later constructed sawmills at Marinette, Wisconsin. His mills manufactured lumber that was sold in Michigan, and as far away as Chicago and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. For the first few years of Nelson Ludington & Company, the main docks and lumber yards of the firm were in Milwaukee and was the main distribution point to places throughout the United States via shipping on the Great Lakes. Ludington's older brother Harrison joined the company in 1851 and took charge of the operations in Milwaukee. Nelson Ludington started a branch of the company in Chicago and eventually made it his headquarters, as the city was booming and became the center of the Midwest. In 1854 the Milwaukee office closed. The business in Chicago greatly expanded and had some changes in partners. The firm continued until 1868, when it was renamed as \\"Nelson Ludington Company\\", with Ludington as its president. He held that position until his death in 1883, serving as CEO of the company that bore his name for thirty-five years. In 1863, Ludington was involved in forming the Fifth National Bank of Chicago. He became its president in 1868, serving until 1872, when it became the National Bank of America. While living in the city, he became one of its directors. He accumulated a considerable fortune. Marriage and family He married Charlotte J. and they had two daughters. Mary Ludington married Charles J. Barnes, of the publishing house of A. S. Barnes and Company. He became managing director of the American Book Company in Chicago. Jennie married George W. Young, a Chicago businessman. Ludington died of a short-term illness on January 15, 1883, in Chicago. He left a large estate to his wife and daughters.  Legacy  The Ludington Building, the earliest-surviving steel-frame building in Chicago, was financed in part by his daughter Mary Ludington Barnes from her inheritance. The House of Ludington hotel in the Escanaba Central Historic District still has some portions of the original building dating to the 1860s.

The name Falkenstein was borne by many noble families; Kindler of Knobloch counted six in the Upper Baden region alone: \\"im H√∂llenthale\\", \\"auf dem Schwarzwalde\\", \\"zu Rimsingen\\", \\"am Bodensee\\", \\"im Buchsgau\\", \\"im Wasgau\\".Kindler von Knobloch 1898, p. 323.  History  Coat of arms on the gravestone of Kunos of Falkenstein in St. Gallus (Kirchzarten) The Falkensteins, named after their castle above the H√∂llental, were closely related to, and probably descended from, the lords of Weiler, who had their centre of gravity in a predecessor building of today's Schloss Weiler in Stegen at the mouth of the Witten and Eschbach valleys in Dreisamtal. If one looks at the undated notes in the Rotulus Sanpetrinus, an index of goods belonging to the Abbey of St. Peter in the Black Forest, then a Reynard of Weiler was the first to name himself von Falkenstein after his new castle, Burg Reinhard, in 1152.Mangei 2003, p. 170. Like the lords of Weiler, the Falkensteins were ministeriales of the dukes of Z√§hringen. The Reynard mentioned is accordingly called de domo ducis, \\"of the duke's retinue.\\" The lords of Weiler had already advised the Z√§hringens on the choice of place for their family monastery of St. Peter in the Black Forest in 1093. They and the Falkensteins supported the Z√§hringens against the counts of Haigerloch, whose possessions included Wiesneck Castle and the vogtei east of Stegen enfeoffed by St. M√§rgen's Abbey founded before 1121.Mangei 2003, p. 148. \\"We can guess that the Z√§hringens, in opening up the Black Forest, gave the Falkensteins the task of clearing the area around the Zartenbach stream (today the Rotbach, H√∂llenbach). In 1148, they reached the \\"untere Steige\\" (\\"Lower Reaches\\"), the valley near H√∂llsteig, and erected the Oswald Chapel there.\\"Haselier 1966, p. 192. At its peak, the Falkenstein area, excluding from scattered estates, encompassed the Dreisamtal from the mouth of the Krummbach upwards and the catchment of the Rotbach to Lake Titisee, from there northwards as far as Thurner and southwards to the Feldberg, including the village of Zastler. In addition to the Falkenstein Castle, they had another more recent fortification, the remains of which were called \\"the ruins of Bubenstein\\", a castle called New Falkenstein (Neufalkenstein) west of Kirchzarten and the Dinghof farm at Kirchzarten, where they acted as advocates and vassal lords of the Abbey of St. Gallen. Apart from the aforementioned Reynard the following members of the family were important: Extract of the family tree of the lords of Falkenstein in H√∂llental.Kindler von Knobloch, 1898, p. 325, and Haselier, 1966, p. 197. * James of Falkenstein (died 1298), to whom the commandry of the Knights Hospitaller in Freiburg im Breisgau confirmed the advocacy and fief, when they sold the patronage of the Kirchzarten parish church of St. Gallus in 1297 to the Abbey of St. Gallen.

He sponsored an annual requiem for his brother, Kuno, who died in 1306 and is buried in Tennenbach Abbey * Kuno of Falkenstein (died 1343), the son of Gregory, bought his father's fief in 1320, namely the high jurisdiction over Kirchzarten together with its estates, hunting rights and serfs \\"with all the possession that we have had so far\\". Kuno was laid to rest in the parish church of St. Gallus, where his gravestone has survived. According to tradition he was made a crusader knight. \\"To the researcher he is well known from various documents as \\"Lord over Kirchzarten\\", and his nearest family members often have close ties with our village.

Their castle was destroyed in 1389. Whether they were really guilty of being robber barons is not clear. It was the time of the leagues of towns, who engaged in fierce feuds against the princes. In any case, the Freiburgers reported \\"to our good and healthy friends, the masters, the sheriffs and councillors who are named below, Strasbourg, Basle, Colmar, Sletzat, Rinfelden, Baden, Waldshut and Bruges, ... as you know about the war, which the lords and the towns of the Federation have waged against one another, you know too that Werner of Falkenstein, son of Lord Kuno of Falkenstein, once a knight, himself took up arms in this same war against the towns on behalf of the noble lords on account of Lord Wirtenberg, whose vassal he was, as he said. For this reason, this same Werner occupied Falkenstein Castle, in which he had a small stake, so that no-one might walk by on the road or through the valley without him or his retinue knowing who it was; and if he understood that he belonged to the towns of the Federation, he robbed him as is commonplace in all wars... and we advanced on the same Saint Nicholas' Eve to this castle, and captured it the same day with the help of Almighty God and burned, devastated and punished it in such measure that on Saint Nicholas' Day we dared lavishly praise God and bless all pious people who walk this road trustingly.\\"Translated from Mediaeval German.

Conrad-Dietrich and Little K√ºnlin were imprisoned, but were released in 1390 on swearing an Urfehdeschwur, an oath never to participate in a feud again. All three Falkensteins survived the feud without suffering permanent loss. Werner, Conrad-Dietrich and Little K√ºnlin were the last lords of the castle. It remained in ruins. The Falkenstein estates gradually transferred to others, especially urban patricians such as the Schnewlins of Landeck. The Falkensteins continued to live in other houses in Freiburg, however, and often held leading positions there. \\"In such a way, in more recent centuries they were making decisions about Kirchzarten valley and its farmers which their knightly ancestors had ruled for the castles there and which had now come under the jurisdiction and administration (Talvogtei) of the town.\\"Haselier 1966, p. 202.

His courtesy name was Xianheng (‰ªôËòÖ). Lianyuan came from the Cuigiya clan of Haixi Jurchens. He was also a member of the Bordered Red Banner (Kubuhe fulgiyan G≈´sa) under the Eight Banners system. He was best known for his role during the Boxer Rebellion and his death as a result of his views on how to pacify the internal and external chaos which were the consequences of the rebellion.  Career  Lianyuan obtained his Jinshi title by passing the imperial exams in the year of 1868. Then he was elected a Shujishi, a temporary position held by the elites among the Jinshi rank. His first official appointment as an officer was in the Anqing Fu. He mainly administered the internal affairs of Anhui Province before being summoned to the capital in the year of 1899. Lianyuan was appointed an official of Zongli Yamen, the foreign ministry of China de facto of late Qing dynasty as a supernumerary. Soon he was promoted to the institution of Grand Secretariat where he acted as one of the grand secretary, a position that parallels the Ottoman grand vizier. After the outbreak of the Boxer rebellion, the xenophobic rebels attacked the embassies of many European countries. At this point of time, some officials in the Chinese government could not resist the temptation of expelling the westerners by the means of this very rebellion. The rebellion was largely against the European powers and consequently drew the sympathy of numerous government officials. Xu Tong and Chongyi, both being sympathizers of the Boxer rebels, claim that \\"The sentiment of people can be used.\\" on an imperial conference.Such claim met the opposition from Lianyuan. He insists that \\"People's sentiment can be used but the sentiment of criminals can not be used.\\" In the yeae of 1900, the Eight- Nation Alliance occupied by force the port of Dagu. The siege of Beijing and the fall of it marked the failure of the sympathizing policy on the matter of Boxer rebellion. However, the ultraconservatives among the Chinese officials tried to start a total resistance by moving the capital to the western city of Xi'an. Prince Zaiyi of the royal house of Aisin-gioro held firmly his aggression against the invading European alliance. Lianyuan found the idea of the prince to be ridiculously dangerous and retorted him by arguing that during the First Sino-Japanese War, China lost the war to Japan, one single modernized power among many, and it could not possibly win the war against the eight country alliance.

The Boxer Protocol was signed between China and the Eight countries alliance. China agreed to put the rebellion to rest and make compensation to the loses of the invading forces. Among the protocols, five Chinese officials were mentioned for their consistent opposition to the violent solution. The protocol demands that they are to be rewarded.

This landform element is also called the Lower Rhine Hill Ridge. The sandhills, which in some places reach around hundred meters in height (Klever Berg (106 m)) and protrude more than sixty meters above the surrounding river terraces of the Lower Rhine, originated in the penultimate glacial period (the Saale glaciation) as terminal moraine ridges from glaciers advancing from the northeast.

It is coordinated by the Estonian organization Let's Do It! World. The next World Cleanup Day is 18 September 2021. World Cleanup Day is celebrated with litter cleanup and waste mapping activities spanning every time zone. Environmental cleanup events are held in nearly every country until concluding near the international date line in Hawaii and American Samoa. Purpose An example of the pollution that World Clean Up Day aims to clean up. World Cleanup Day is held over the course of a 24-hour period, on the 3rd Saturday of September annually. World Cleanup Day aims to raise awareness of the mismanaged waste crisis by mobilizing all spheres of society to participate in cleanup actions. Individuals, governments, corporations and organisations are all encouraged to take part in cleanups and to find solutions to tackle mismanaged waste. There are numerous organizations that facilitate and host World Cleanup Day events globally. Like Earth Day, World Cleanup Day is non- partisan, apolitical, and is not affiliated with any national or global political party or discrete ideology.. History The inaugural World Cleanup Day was 15 September 2018, but it builds on the successes of previous global cleanup efforts. The goal of World Cleanup Day 2018 was to involve 5% of the world's population (or approximately 380 million people). While the effort fell short of the goal, it directly mobilized 18 million people worldwide. The 2019 World Cleanup Day was held on the third Saturday of September and coincided with Peace Day and the Global climate strike of September 2019. Global cleanup efforts have existed in many forms throughout human history, especially after widespread catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods, and powerful tsunamis. In modern history, these efforts are typically undertaken by the affected communities, with support from various international organizations and NGOs, such as Red Cross, Oxfam, and other relief organizations but typically in post-conflict zones. They have included efforts to remove land mines, beach cleanups, and other municipal and non-governmental actions. Participants Participants in World Cleanup Days are typically volunteers, with coordination from non-governmental organizations who assist in awareness-raising, logistics, and fundraising.

Conservation leftIn their 2008 assessment, the IUCN listed the Paraguana moustached bat as critically endangered. The 2016 assessment, however, downlisted them to endangered. In 2013, Bat Conservation International listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation. In 2015, Bat Conservation International began fundraising for bat detectors to better survey the critical habitat necessary for the species' survival. The species is especially threatened by intentional destruction by humans; in 1997, thousands of dead bats were found in one of the caves after locals set tires on fire at the cave entrance. Some Venezuelans mistakenly believe that all bats are vampire bats, and should therefore be exterminated. To reduce vandalism and protect the bats, a gate was installed in 2003 at the entrance of one of the caves, with gaps large enough for bats to come and go, but too small for human passage. After the gate was installed, the number of bats using the cave \\"substantially increased\\".

The district served as the port of entry to Salvador from the beginning of the colonial period and later became home to the first planned business district in Brazil. It remains a financial center in the state of Bahia, as well as a municipal transportation hub and tourist destination. Com√©rcio is home to numerous national heritage sites dating from the early colonial period to the 20th century. Com√©rcio as a whole was listed as a national historic district of Brazil by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 2008. Location Com√©rcio is located in lower city (cidade baixa) below the Historic Center (cidade alta) of Salvador. It extends from the Bahia Marina at its southernmost point to the breakwaters near the Port of Salvador in the √Ågua de Meninos district to the north. The Bay of All Saints makes up its western border and the districts of S√©, Pelourinho, and Pilar sit above it to the east. The district includes S√£o Marcelo Fort, a 17th-century military structure on a small piece of land from the coast. The upper city, or cidade alta, sits above the lower city. The largest square in the district, Visconde de Cairu Square Plaza, is located to the south adjacent to the Port. Three avenues, all parallel to the port, cross the neighborhood from north to south: Avenida da Fran√ßa, named for the country of France; Avenida Estados Unidos, named for the United States; and Rua Miguel Calmon, named for Miguel Calmon du Pin e Almeida, a Bahian politician and diplomat. Cross streets in the district are named for Sweden, Norway, Spain, Holland, Poland, Argentina, England, Greece, and Belgium. Avenida Lafayete Coutinho begins at the plaza and runs south along the Bay of All Saints out of the district to Pra√ßa Dois de Julho. The Ladeira da Montanha was constructed in the 19th century to connect the lower and upper city; it was also home to a red-light district. History Com√©rcio, in the period as the Cidade Baixa, consisted of a narrow street that ran from the port to the avenue that led to the upper city. The area was home to the warehouses of the city and was the commercial center for both colonial Portuguese and foreign merchants, notably those in the slave trade. The avenue was lined with shops selling fruits, vegetables, and meat. A single gutter in the middle of the avenue provided the only waste drainage in the district. Maria Graham, who visited in 1821, described it as \\"without any exception, the filthiest place I ever was in.\\" The Cidade Baixa served as the point of arrival for slaves in Brazil and slave markets existed on every street in the district. Graham described the slave market as \\"there are shops full of those poor wretches, who are exposed there stark naked and bought like cattle, over whom the buyers have the same power.\\" Wealthy merchants and plantation owners maintained homes, churches, and civic buildings in the Cidade Alta, the upper city, far from the Cidade Baixa. A large-scale landfill project began in Com√©rcio in 1910 as part of the modernization of the Port of Salvador. The expansion of the area was balanced against the preservation of structures along the approximately four narrow streets of the historic Cidade Baixa. Nearly every street in the district was widened and a large strip of empty land sat between the historic district and the port. The district subsequently became the center of business and finance in Salvador by the mid-20th century. Com√©rcio suffered a period of stagnation in the early 1980s and companies migrated to the Iguatemi region. It remains the location of the regional headquarters of several corporations, including the Bradesco, Citibank, and the Bank of Brazil in Bahia. Public agencies headquartered in the district include the Bahia State Board of Trade (JUCEB), the Port Customs of Salvador, and the National Social Security Institute (INSS) in Bahia. Military facilities include the 2nd Naval District of the Brazilian Navy and the Naval Hospital of Salvador. Transportation Connections between Comercio in the lower city, and the Praca da Se in the upper city date to the 19th century and are still in use. The south of Comercio is connected to the Praca da Se via the Lacerda Elevator. The north of the district is connected to via a funicular, the Plano Inclinado Gon√ßalves (PIG). Com√©rcio is also an important hub of the urban bus system of Salvador. The Terminal da Fran√ßa, located in front of the Port, is the primary hub for bus lines. The Architectural, Urban and Landscape Set of the City of Salvador Com√©rcio was listed as a national historic district of Brazil by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 2008. It was listed under the name of the Architectural, Urban and Landscape Set of the City of Salvador (Conjunto Arquitet√¥nico, Urban√≠stico e Paisag√≠stico da Cidade Baixa de Salvador) and is included in the Book of Historical Works process no. 122-T, inscription no. 127; and the Book of Fine Arts, Inscription fls 23.

It is located in the Com√©rcio district on Pra√ßa Cayru, a public square, in close proximity to the Mercado Modelo, a public market. The house is entirely glazed in azulejo, a tin-glazed ceramic tile; all of the tiles of the sobrado were manufactured in Portugal. The structure was listed as a national heritage site by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1969. Udo Knoff, a ceramics researcher, called the building \\"the most azulejo-tiled building\\" in Bahia. History The Sobrado Azulejado was built at the end of the 19th century, dedicated to the business of the Port of Salvador. By 1935 it was home to the Urban Planning Office for the City of Salvador (EPUCS). The building was sold in June 1949 and EPUCS was relocated elsewhere in the city. By 1987 the owner of the building was listed as Abdala Gaid. The Hilton hotel chain has attempted to build a hotel in the Com√©rcio. A petition to the state government in 2015 requested the expropriation and demolition of Sobrado Azulejado and six other historic structures in the district for the construction of a high- rise hotel. The plan was supported by Jo√£o Henrique Carneiro, governor of Bahia from 2005 to 2013. A compromise was reached that the hotel would demolish the all parts of the structure but retain and restore the fa√ßade. The status of the Hilton hotel plan went into limbo in 2013 as Carneiro left office coupled with subsequent litigation over the plan. In 2015, the decree that made public property (first step for expropriation) published in the Official Gazette of the Municipality (DOM), seven properties in the region - including the sobrado - will be used as equipment for the Museum of Music and the Public Archive of City. The ownership of Sobrado Azulejado remained in litigation as of 2015; two unnamed owners claim the property and its status remains undetermined. Structure The structure is of brick and consists of four floors with a tiled roof. It is built in the Eclectic style. The fa√ßade of the building is covered in blue and white azulejos manufactured in Portugal. The building has 20 doors and 70 windows and covers . Each of the windows is framed in azulejos. Restoration work was carried out on the Sobrado Azulejado between 1970 and 1973 to stabilize the building. The azulejo fa√ßade was preserved, but the interior of the building was significantly altered through the use of concrete slabs to stabilize the building. The building has steadily fallen into disrepair since the stabilization project. 60% of the roof collapsed in 2017. Azulejos Azulejo facade of the Capela das Almas in Porto, Portugal. Buildings coated entirely in azulejos are found in both Portugal and Brazil, and in both religious and domestic architecture. The Capela das Almas in Porto, Portugal is an early and well-preserved example of the azulejo-glazed building; similar sobrados were constructed in the Ladeira dos Aflitos, Boqueir√£o, and Soledade neighborhoods of Bahia. The azulejos of Sobrado Azulejado are of two general types, both white with blue design. Those around the window are in the painting in the negative technique, which originated in Belgium in the 17th century. They measure .

First elected to the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne in 1982, he began his first term as Grand Chief in 1984. He served on the Mohawk Council almost continuously for more than 30 years, having been reelected as Grand Chief as recently as 2012. Prior to entering politics, Mitchell studied and directed films with the National Film Board as part of its Indian Film Crew. His films include the 1969 documentary film about the 1969 Akwesasne border crossing dispute, You Are on Indian Land, for which he belatedly received directorial credit almost 50 years after its completion. For the future Grand Chief, the experience of making You Are on Indian Land blurred the lines between filmmaking and politics: Mitchell directed several more films on First Nations issues at the NFB, then worked with the North American Indian Traveling College (now Ronathahonni Cultural Centre) to set up replica of a traditional Mohawk settlement on Kawehno:ke (Cornwall Island) and produce educational material and videos that helped to spread Native culture awareness. He was one of several First Nations filmmakers honoured at a retrospective screening on February 25, 2017 at TIFF Bell Lightbox.

Origin According to the 16th-century Ecthesis Chronica, Hass Murad and his brother, Mesih Pasha, were sons of a certain Gidos Palaiologos, identified by the contemporary Historia Turchesca as a brother of a Byzantine Emperor. This is commonly held to have been Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Byzantine emperor, who fell during the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1453. If true, since Constantine XI died childless, and if the Ottomans had failed to conquer Constantinople, Mesih or Hass Murad might have succeeded him. The brothers were captured during the fall of Constantinople, converted to Islam, and raised as pages under the auspices of Sultan Mehmed II as part of the dev≈üirme system. The exact identity of his father is unclear; Sphrantzes adds the name of \\"Thomas\\" to \\"Gidos\\", while several scholars, beginning with Martin Crusius, rather improbably equated the latter name to the Venetian \\"Guido\\", Latin \\"Vitus\\". However, neither Murad nor his brother can be identified with any of the known sons of Constantine XI's brothers who survived into adulthood‚ÄîThomas, Demetrios, and Theodore‚Äîleading Franz Babinger to suggest an illegitimate origin. Career and death Murat Pasha Mosque, begun by Hass Murad Pasha in 1465/66 In contrast to his brother, Murad's early life and career in Ottoman service are obscure. He must have enjoyed the favour of the Sultan‚Äîthe sobriquet Hass, by which he is known, is an adjective meaning \\"private, personal\\" and designated intimacy and favour with a ruler‚Äîand wealthy, since in 1465/66 he begun construction of a mosque in the Aksaray district of Constantinople, which was completed by is brother Mesih, who was eventually buried there. When Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá was dismissed as Grand Vizier and beylerbey (governor-general) of the Rumelia Eyalet in , Hass Murad succeeded him in the latter position. He seems to have held it until 1473, when he participated in a campaign against the Ak Koyunlu ruler Uzun Hassan in Anatolia, in which he was defeated and killed. During this campaign, he commanded the army's right wing a force of 20,000 men with 40 sanjakbeys. Uzun Hassan retreated before the Ottomans beyond the Euphrates. According to some Ottoman historians, Mahmud Pasha, who served under Murad's command, tried to warn him that the Ak Koyunlu were wont to employ feigned retreats and that he should follow them cautiously, but Murad, who is portrayed as young, impetuous, and eager to claim glory for himself, did not heed him. Instead he moved ahead with part of his army, crossed the Euphrates, and was caught in an ambush on 4 August. The ensuing Battle of Tercan was a disaster for the Ottomans: Murad was killed‚Äîalthough Uzun Hassan's letter to the Doge of Venice claims that he was captured‚Äîalong with a large part of the Ottoman army, while several distinguished commanders, including Turahanoƒülu √ñmer Bey and Fenarioƒülu Ahmed Pasha, were taken prisoner. Other historians, however, including contemporary Greek and Latin sources, accuse Mahmud Pasha of knowing about the ambush and failing to warn Murad, because he was jealous of him.

Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote both the music and lyrics to the song. Synopsis Charles Lee The song recounts a duel which occurred between John Laurens and Charles Lee. The duel took place as a result of disparaging remarks made by Lee about George Washington following Lee's dismissal from the role of Major General in the Continental Army in the wake of Lee's failure at the Battle of Monmouth. The song sets out the ten rules involved in a duel of the era, before the seconds in the duel, Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, convene to attempt to make peace. Burr labels duels \\"dumb and immature\\", but Hamilton insists that they proceed, with the duel continuing as planned. The song culminates with a countdown, resulting in Laurens non-fatally shooting Lee in the side after Hamilton encourages him to \\"not throw away his shot\\", a motif in the show and expression of the time. Analysis The eponymous ten commandments refer to the Ten Commandments of the Abrahamic faiths, which guide followers on how to live their lives. Miranda also stated that the concept of ten commandments stemmed from the \\"Ten Crack Commandments\\", which served as a guide to illegal acts during the 1990s, as well as being a song by the Notorious B.I.G. This connection is acknowledged in the credits of the 2020 filmed version of Hamilton, which states that elements of \\"Ten Crack Commandments\\" is used by permission. Elizabeth Logan, writing for Huffington Post, stated that the song has a key role in making the audience \\"comfortable with duels\\". This becomes important in Act 2 of the musical, where two duels occur in Weehawken, New Jersey. Thus, as per the author, the audience will be on board when \\"some beloved characters pick up pistols\\" later on in the musical. The song receives two reprises at key junctures in the musical: during \\"Blow Us All Away\\" when Philip Hamilton and George Eacker are about to duel, and in \\"The World Was Wide Enough\\" in the lead-up to the Burr-Hamilton duel. In addition, the counting Leitmotif is heard in a modified form in various songs throughout the show, such as in the first of the \\"Cabinet Battle\\" songs, where it is orchestrated in baroque counterpoint, or in \\"Take a Break\\", where Phillip and his mother Eliza Hamilton argue over and learn about the correct notes on a piano scale and French counting. Critical reception The Young Folks had it ranked 29th among songs in Hamilton. Huffington Post said that the song was a \\"club-worthy jam\\", and Vibe.com said that it contained a \\"strong percussive beat\\" with the men involved \\"exuding dominance\\".

Multidrug-resistant S. aureus such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, demanding new strategies for prevention and therapy of staphylococcal infections. The symptomless colonization of the human nasal by S. aureus represents a major risk factor for invasive S. aureus infections. Peschel's laboratory pioneered research on the strategies used by S. aureus to colonize the human nasal and elude the immune system to cause infections. In 2016 his team demonstrated that many nasal bacteria produce antimicrobial compounds such as the novel antibiotic lugdunin that may become a foundation for novel drugs against bacterial infections and may be used to prevent pathogen colonization.

Also certified as a midwife, she delivered babies for the Hawaiian, Portuguese and Chinese populations in Honolulu, practicing for over fifty years. In 1946, she was credited by Robert Ripley as having delivered more babies than any other private practitioner in the United States. Early life Kong Tai Heong was born on April 25, 1875 in Waichow, Guangdong Province, China. Abandoned as an infant on the steps of the Berlin Foundling House in Hong Kong with a note pinned to her basket giving her name, Kong grew up in the orphanage run by German nuns. Believing that the young girl who had helped them care for other children had promise, they helped her apply to the Canton Medical School to study western medicine. At the school, she met Li Khai Fai and the two worked side-by-side helping the physicians deal with the 1893 outbreak of plague which struck Canton and Hong Kong. Over objections voiced by Li's parents and Kong's professors, who did not want to lose their star pupil, the two married within hours of their graduation on June 3, 1896. The following day, they boarded a ship for Honolulu, hoping to be able to provide medical services for the large Chinese population in the city. The voyage took thirty days, and they arrived in the Republic of Hawaii on July 4. Career Unable to work as physicians, Kong and Li lived in abject poverty with Li taking what work he could find as a laborer in a tobacco warehouse. Through an acquaintance, Kong met Reverend Frank Damon, a former missionary in Canton, who agreed to assist. Damon arranged an audience with President Sanford B. Dole, who after hearing Kong's plea, agreed to allow the couple to meet with the Board of Medical Examiners with the assistance of an interpreter. After a comprehensive oral examination, each was issued a medical license, making Kong the first Chinese woman to practice western medicine in Hawaii. Working mainly as an obstetrician, Kong developed a rapport with the Hawaiian and Portuguese populations, who were her main clientele. Kong did have Chinese clients, but strong beliefs in traditional Chinese medicine prevailed and made many in the Chinese immigrant population treat her Western-methods with suspicion. Between 1897 and 1914, Kong continued her medical practice giving birth to 13 children. Eight of them survived and she would carry them with her to her office each day to continue her work. In addition to working as an obstetrician, Kong was certified as a midwife. In 1899, when a case of plague was suspected, Li urged the Chinese residents to notify authorities of any suspicious deaths. As he and Kong had been involved in the earlier plague epidemic in Hong Kong and were trained bacteriologists, they were aware of the dangers of concealing the evidence. Fires that had been set by the Board of Health as sanitary measures to rid the area of plague-carrying rats and burn the clothing and infested goods of victims, were fanned by the wind and burned the city's Chinatown area severely. Many blamed Li for their losses and he left his medical practice, turning instead toward teaching and leaving Kong to be the primary earner of the family. In 1946, Ripley's Believe It or Not! newspaper column, \\"Believe It or Not,\\" claimed that Kong had delivered over 6,000 babies and gave her the record of the highest number of deliveries for a private practitioner. That same year she celebrated her fiftieth anniversary of practicing medicine. In addition to her medical practice, Kong was involved in establishing the First Chinese Church of Christ in 1926. Prior to that, in 1919, she and her husband had provided medical services for the church supported Wai Wah Yee Yin Hospital, which is now known as the Palolo Chinese Home. She served as president of the Chinese Church Women‚Äôs Society and the Honolulu Chinese Orphanage Society and chaired the Chinese Committee of the American Red Cross and American United Welfare Society. She was on the Board of the First Chinese Church's Yau Mun School and at one time served as a delegate for Hawaii to the Pan-Pacific Women‚Äôs Conference. Death and legacy Kong died on August 11, 1951 in Honolulu. After her death, one of the Li's daughters, Ling-Ai, a playwright and producer of the Oscar-winning documentary Kukan, wrote her parents story in the book, Life Is for a Long Time: A Chinese-Hawaiian Memoir. Another daughter, Mary Sia, was a noted cookbook writer. In March 2017, Hawai ªi Magazine included her on a list of the most influential women in Hawaiian history.

She later studied at the Tennessee Normal School and Burritt College. Page began teaching at the Fanning Orphan School in 1884 when it was opened by Charlotte Fanning. Page was an editor for The Gospel Advocate and authored the \\"Children's Corner\\" column. This column was aimed at young children, offering wisdom and encouragement on topics such as the death of siblings and parents. Page encouraged children to send her letters and included them in her column along with her sympathetic replies. Emma Page is best known for recording, editing and publishing the sermons of Theophilus Brown Larimore (1843‚Äì1929). She did most of the editing of volume one when the original editor, Fletcher Douglas Srygley (1856‚Äì1900) fell ill. She alone completed volumes two and three. Between 1901 and 1903 Page had recorded many of Larimore's sermons for her own pleasure. The sales volume of the first book of sermons led to demand for more and the publisher of The Gospel Advocate engaged Page, who had the trust of Larimore, to transcribe, select, and arrange the contents of the second book published in 1904 and the third book published in 1910. T. B. Larimore's first wife died in 1907 and he married Emma Page on January 1, 1911. The coupled traveled across North America for the next year, during which time they did evangelistic work. Emma Larimore wrote a book about these travels. T.B. Larimore's children were all married and so he and his wife were free to travel and pursue missionary work. During 1912‚Äì1913, the Larimores moved to Gainesville, Florida, and worked at promoting the establishment of the Dixieland College. In 1920 T.B. Larimore became the pastor of the Christian Church in San Francisco, California. The Larimores settled into a new home in Berkeley, California.

ENMs have three strengths: simplicity, ability to yield a unique solution for each structure, and efficient applicability to supramolecular complexes/assemblies. Her theory and methods have withstood numerous tests since their inception, and established fundamental concepts in molecular biology: the role of entropy- driven fluctuations defined by 3D contact topology in optimizing biomolecular interactions; the evolutionary pressure for robustly maintaining structural dynamics to support flexible mechanisms of actions ‚Äì not only structure to ensure stability; the ability of proteins to exploit their structure-encoded dynamics to adapt to promiscuous interactions and mutations as demonstrated in numerous applications, including neurotransmitter transporters in recent years.

Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote both the music and lyrics to the song. The song recounts the events of the 1804 duel in Weehawken, New Jersey between then‚ÄìVice President Aaron Burr and former Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. Synopsis An artistic interpretation of the duel The song begins in Burr's perspective. Burr states ten facts about the duel (particularly facts that made it clear that Hamilton had the advantage) as a reprise of \\"Ten Duel Commandments\\" plays, noting that the duel is taking place in the same spot where Hamilton's son was killed in a duel. Burr also states that he will not allow Hamilton to kill him because he doesn't want his daughter to become an orphan and also because he is tired of waiting for his moment (reflecting Hamilton's own methodology from \\"My Shot\\"). He shoots Hamilton and as the bullet approaches him, time freezes and Hamilton breaks into a soliloquy, wondering if his death will be his legacy. He then realizes that a legacy by definition is something no one ever really lives to see as well as something no one can control, but finds peace by mentioning some of his deceased friends who await him \\"on the other side\\" before stating his regret that his wife will be left without him because of this. With that said, in a mix of fear, confidence, and sadness, he throws away his shot by slowly aiming his pistol at the sky. Time resumes as Burr, who was not expecting Hamilton to throw away his shot, shouts \\"wait!\\" as the bullet finally hits Hamilton. A shocked Burr then discusses the aftermath of the duel, as he was ushered away from his opponent and was then told that he should probably hide, so he retreated to a bar for a drink. He laments that he is now doomed to be the villain in Hamilton's history rather than being appraised on his own achievements, and informs the audience that Hamilton died not long after in the company of his wife Eliza and her sister Angelica. He then regretfully states that he should have \\"known the world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me.\\" According to the credits of the 2020 filmed version of Hamilton, this song contains elements of Ten Crack Commandments by The Notorious B.I.G., and the writers of that song also share in the writing credit of \\"The World Was Wide Enough\\". Analysis The song takes its title and inspiration from a quote by Burr: \\"Had I read Sterne more and Voltaire less, I should have known the world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me\\". This was a reference to a scene in Sterne's Tristam Shandy. The character Uncle Toby tells a fly, \\"Go poor Devil, get thee gone, why should I hurt thee? This world is surely wide enough to hold thee and me.\\" It features reprises and leitmotifs from multiple other songs in the musical, including \\"My Shot\\", ‚ÄúThe Story of Tonight\\", \\"Wait for It\\", ‚ÄúTen Duel Commandments\\" and ‚ÄúOne Last Time\\". It also marks the last time in which Hamilton speaks on stage. The song features a variety of musical styles, from the fast-paced and frenetic beginning to the slow, poetic ponderings of Hamilton prior to his death. Critical reception The Young Folks had it ranked as the 16th best song in the musical. Huffington Post praised the \\"poignant rumination on death and legacy\\", and said that the song was effective as it makes Burr complex and real, rather than a mere villain. Legacy Democratic Presidential Candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton quoted from the song at the DNC during her 2016 Presidential Campaign, saying \\"Let our legacy be about 'planting seeds in a garden you never get to see'\\", a reference to Hamilton's soliloquy. Lin-Manuel Miranda responded positively on Twitter, stating \\"I'm with her\\".

Hermann Otto Hettner (born 27 January 1875, Dresden; d. 19 April 1931, Dresden) was a German painter, illustrator, engraver, and sculptor, and a professor at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. Life Otto Hettner, Portrait of Theodor D√§ubler (n.d.) Otto Hettner was the son of the literary historian Hermann Theodor Hettner (1821‚Äì1882) and Anna Hettner (1838‚Äì1897), the oldest daughter of German painter August Grahl. At the turn of the century, between 1897 and 1904, Hettner studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe, with Robert P√∂tzelberger, and at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris. From 1904 to 1911, Hettner lived in Florence, where Jeanne Alexandrine Thibert (1878‚Äì1958) gave birth to his son Roland Hettner (1905‚Äì1978) on 26 October 1905. Roland later worked as an illustrator. In May 1907, Otto Hettner married Jeanne Thibert (1878‚Äì1958), a French woman, in London. Shortly thereafter, their daughter Sabine Hettner was born. As an adult, Sabine became a noted painter of landscapes and portraits. With his family, Hettner returned to Dresden in 1913 and studied at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. In 1916 he became a member of the executive committee of the Free Secession, and the next year he became the director of the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, where he worked as a professor and president from 1918 to 1927. Hettner illustrated various books for renowned publishers of the time, including Avalun-Verlag, Marees-Gesellschaft, and Pan-Presse.

The Case family owned and operated a paper mill from 1862 until 1967, built architecturally sophisticated residences, and minimally developed what is now the Case Mountain Recreation Area, a rustic public park in southeastern Manchester. Their properties were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The Case Brothers Historic District is located in southeastern Manchester, isolated to some degree from the rest of the city by Interstate 384 to the northwest, and from other development by the rough terrain of Case Mountain to the south. The district includes a brick and wood-frame mill complex, dams and bridges built by the Case Brothers across Birch Mountain Brook that resulted in the creation of Upper and Lower Case Ponds, and the two handsome residential estates of Alfred Wells Case and Albert Willard Case. The two houses, at 673 and 680 Spring Street, are walking distance to the brothers' mill, which stands near the outlet of Lower Case Pond. Both houses were built in the 1860s and were originally fully Italianate in style, but were both extensively restyled in the early 20th century. One was given a Mediterranean Revival style, with a stuccoed exterior, and the other was transformed into a Colonial Revival mansion. The twin Case brothers both learned the papermaking trade in plants on the Hockanum River. Recognizing business opportunities created by the American Civil War, they established their own paper facility at this location in 1862. The enclave of family houses was developed beginning in 1869. Over the next several decades, the brothers expanded their land holdings and business interests, building a nearly self-contained mill community then known as Highland Park. The company was passed on to the next generation (the brothers dying in 1908 and 1925), and survived the Great Depression. The family sold the paper business to Boise Cascade in 1967, which continued to operate on the site until 1973. The principal residences have also been sold out of the family. The informal park that the Cases created on Case Mountain is now a patchwork of land owned by the city and by a local conservation trust.

She was a strong supporter of temperance and active in the Temperance movement and spoke out for women's rights. She was also a part on the \\"New Women\\" movement.  Personal life  Silena Moore was born on July 9, 1850 near Lynchburg, Tennessee and died September 18, 1915. She married Doctor T.P. Holman in January 1875. Her father, Captain J. L. Moore, fought in the Civil War as a Confederate Army officer and died from battle wounds when she was only fourteen. The family had to sell their homestead to pay off accumulating debts; as the oldest, Holman took on the responsibility of caring for her three sisters and brother by earning a living as a teacher and within two years she was able to pay off the family debts. Silena Moore met future husband Dr. T.P. Holman when he treated her for a severe illness in 1874. They were married a year later. The couple had eight children together.  Career  For fifteen years, Holman was the president of the Tennessee Woman's Christian Temperance Union which membership exceeded 4,000. She wrote for the Gospel Advocate. Her first article appeared in the February 1888 issue entitled, \\"Shall the Church Help the Saloon To Live?\\" in the article to encouraged church members to make nonintoxicating drinks for refreshment and even included her own recipe. Also, in 1888 Holman wrote a letter to the editor of the Gospel Advocate; she was responding to an article by the editor David Lipscomb in which he argued that women do not have the authority to teach men on spiritual matters and therefore shouldn't teach mixed groups of men and women in church or smaller studies. In her response,\\"Let Your Women Keep Silent,\\" Holman took a different stance from the common interpretation of Paul's command. This sparked a debate between her and the editors about the role of women in the church.  Views  Silena supported the traditional view that husbands are the head of their households and wives first role is to support the family; however, she believed there was no reason to prevent women teaching on biblical topics and to support her claims she pointed to examples of women in the bible who were placed in positions of power by God. In the 1890s, Silena aligned herself with \\"New Women\\" movement which supported women's suffrage, better education for women, and more opportunities for church leadership.

In 1949 the pair wrote their first children's book, Friends ('S√µbrad'), which would be followed by three more. Their books were credited with \\"broadening the horizons of reading for Estonian children\\", perhaps because they showed pre-Soviet Estonia in a positive light, a rarity in the Stalinist era.Reet Krusten: T√§helepandamatult ja silmapaistvalt, in: Keel ja Kirjandus 3/1995, S. 208. After 1964, Maran wrote independently and published his works under his own name.Reet Krusten: Eesti Lastekirjandus. Tartu: Elmatar 1995, S. 203. His greatest success came with the fairy-tale Londiste, Real Name Phant ('Londiste, √µige nimega Vant', 1972) and its sequel Hot Ice Cream ('Tuline j√§√§tis', 1976). In 1974 he was awarded the Juhan Smuul Prize, the State Prize of the Estonian SSR, for his contributions to children's literature.  Translations  Maran's books have been translated into several languages, principally Russian and German. Foreign translations of his works were generally produced in Tallinn without the involvement of foreign publishers, leading some scholars to characterize these translations as pseudoreception, a process whereby state-sponsored Soviet literature was unilaterally translated and exported into target languages without any involvement or interest from the target audience.Cornelius Hasselblatt: Estnische Literatur in deutscher √úbersetzung. Eine Rezeptionsgeschichte vom 19. bis zum 21. Jahrhundert. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz 2011, S. 222. Hot Ice Cream was translated into English in 1983 by Aino J√µgi, and is the only one of Maran's works to have received an English translation. Maran himself worked as a translator from Russian into Estonian.  Bibliography  * (Lall Kahas) P√µlev alus. Draama 5 vaatuses. ('The Burning Car. A Drama in 5 Acts').

By the late Ottoman period Albanians were mainly Muslims with close ties to the Ottoman Empire. The lack of previous Albanian statehood to draw upon resulted in Albanian nationalism developing later unlike neighbouring nationalisms of the Serbs and Greeks. The onset of the Eastern crisis (1870s) that threatened partition of Balkan Albanian inhabited lands by neighbouring Orthodox Christian states stimulated the emergence of the Albanian national awakening (Rilindja) and nationalist movement.. During the 19th century, some Western scholarly influences, Albanian diasporas such as the Arberesh√´ and Albanian National Awakening figures contributed greatly to spreading influences and ideas among Balkan Albanians within the context of Albanian self- determination. Among those were ideas of an Illyrian contribution to Albanian ethnogenesis which still dominate Albanian nationalism in contemporary times and other ancient peoples claimed as ancestors of the Albanians, in particular the Pelasgians of which have been claimed again in recent times.. Due to overlapping and competing territorial claims with other Balkan nationalisms and states over land dating from the late Ottoman period, these ideas comprise a national myth that establishes precedence over neighboring peoples (Slavs and Greeks) and allow movements for independence and self-determination, as well as irredentist claims against neighboring countries.. \\"Albanians tended to go further back in time to the sixth and seventh centuries, claiming an Illyrian- Albanian continuity and superiority over Slavic people....\\". \\"by identifying with Pelasgians, Albanians could claim that they were present in their Balkan homeland not only before the \\"barbarian\\" invaders of late Roman times (such as the Slavs), not only before the Romans themselves, but also, even more importantly, before the Greeks‚Äü (Malcolm 2002: 76-77).\\". \\"Ethnic Albanians not only comprise the vast majority of the population in Kosova. They have also been brought up to believe that their nation is the oldest in the Balkans, directly descended from the ancient Dardanians (Dardanae), a branch of the 'Illyrian peoples' who had allegedly inhabited most of the western Balkanas (including Kosova) for many centuries before the arrival of the Slavic 'interlopers'...\\".. Pan-Albanian sentiments are also present and historically have been achieved only once when part of Kosovo and western Macedonia was united by Axis Italian forces to their protectorate of Albania during the Second World War. Albanian nationalism contains a series of myths relating to Albanian origins, cultural purity and national homogeneity, religious indifference as the basis of Albanian national identity, and continuing national struggles.. The figure of Skanderbeg is one of the main constitutive myths of Albanian nationalism that is based on a person, as other myths are based on ideas, abstract concepts, and collectivism.. \\"three main constitutive myths at work within Albanian nationalism ...Secondly, the myth of Skanderbeg, ...\\".. \\"Betrachtet man die Gesamtheit der albanischen Nationalmythen, so ist offensichtlich, dass es fur Albaner mehr als nur den Skanderbeg-Mythos gibt und dass nicht nur auf diesem Mythos die albanische Identitat beruht. Es gibt noch weitere wichtige Mythenfiguren, doch diese beziehen sich auf Vorstellungen, abstrakte Konzepte und Kollektive, aber nicht auf Personen.\\" These ideas and concepts were further developed during the interwar period under Ahmet Zog and later the Socialist People's Republic of Albania (1945‚Äì1991), which mainly focused on Illyrian-Albanian continuity in addition to reinterpreting certain Ancient Greek figures and history as Albanian. In a post communist environment, Albanian National Awakening values, ideas and concepts that were enforced, developed further and expanded during Enver Hoxha's regime are still somewhat present within Albanian society and politics that have been reinterpreted within the context of Euro-Atlantic integration..  History   Ottoman period: Development of Albanian Nationalism during National Albanian Awakening  = Background = Flag of Albania Albanian nationalism, unlike its Greek and Serbian counterparts has its origins in a different historical context that did not emerge from an anti-Ottoman struggle and instead dates to the period of the Eastern Crisis (1878) and threat of territorial partition by Serbs and Greeks. Competing with neighbours for contested areas forced Albanians to make their case for nationhood and seek support from European powers.. Those events were a pivotal moment that led to the emergence of myths being generated that became part of the mythology of Albanian nationalism that is expressed in contemporary times within Albanian collective culture and memory. That historical context also made the Albanian national movement defensive in outlook as nationalists sought national affirmation and to counter what they viewed as the erosion of national sentiments and language.. By the 19th century Albanians were divided into three religious groups. Catholic Albanians had some Albanian ethno- linguistic expression in schooling and church due to Austro-Hungarian protection and Italian clerical patronage. Orthodox Albanians under the Patriarchate of Constantinople had liturgy and schooling in Greek and toward the late Ottoman period mainly identified with Greek national aspirations.. para. 2, 27. Muslim Albanians during this period formed around 70% of the overall Balkan Albanian population in the Ottoman Empire with an estimated population of more than a million.. Though there was a sense of some sort of communality among Albanian speakers, the Albanian language came second to different identity markers which took precedence.. Albanian speakers of the period mainly identified each other and themselves through terms relating to a settlement or regions, as Gegs or Tosks or through religious categories (Muslim and Christian). Ethnic terminology such as Shqiptar (Albanian) and Shqip√´ri (Albania) was not indicative as an ethnographic marker of people living in areas. Terminology of the era was generalised and not fixed with Albanian speaking people not all viewing themselves mainly as Albanians. It is unclear to what degree Albanians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries viewed themselves as Albanians or understood that they had affinities with or to each other. The Albanian nation building project did not however emerge without foundations and drew upon a sort of proto-national consciousnesses based on ethnic and linguistic elements that existed prior to 1800 and transformed it into a political and national movement. . = Eastern Crisis and Albanian National Awakening = With the rise of the Eastern Crisis, Muslim Albanians became torn between loyalties to the Ottoman state and the emerging Albanian nationalist movement.. Islam, the Sultan and the Ottoman Empire were traditionally seen as synonymous in belonging to the wider Muslim community.. The Albanian nationalist movement advocated self-determination and strived to achieve socio-political recognition of Albanians as a separate people and language within the state. Albanian nationalism was a movement that began among Albanian intellectuals without popular demand from the wider Albanian population.. Geopolitical events pushed Albanian nationalists, many Muslim, to distance themselves from the Ottomans, Islam and the then emerging pan-Islamic Ottomanism of Sultan Abdulhamid II.. Responding to the Eastern crisis and possible partition, a group of Albanian intellectuals created the League of Prizren to resist neighbouring foreign Balkan states and to assert an Albanian national consciousness by uniting Albanians into a unitary linguistic and cultural nation.. The Frash√´ri brothers, the main leaders of the league opposed both Pan-Slavism of southern Slavic peoples and the Greek Megali Idea. The league opposed territory containing Albanian speakers being awarded to Greece, Serbia and Montenegro. The Ottoman state briefly supported the league's claims viewing Albanian nationalism as possibly preventing further territorial losses to newly independent Balkan states... The geopolitical crisis generated the beginnings of the Rilindja (Albanian National Awakening) period.. para. 5. From 1878 onward Albanian nationalists and intellectuals, some who emerged as the first modern Albanian scholars, were preoccupied with overcoming linguistic and cultural differences between Albanian subgroups (Gegs and Tosks) and religious divisions (Muslim and Christians).. At that time, these scholars lacked access to many primary sources to construct the idea that Albanians were descendants of Illyrians, while Greater Albania was not considered a priority. Compared with their Balkan counterparts, these Albanian politicians and historians were very moderate and mainly had the goal to attain socio-political recognition and autonomy for Albanians under Ottoman rule.. \\"These scholars did not have access to many primary sources to be able to construct the notion of the Illyrian origin of the Albanians yet, and Greater Albania was not a priority. The goal of the day was to persuade the Ottoman officials that Albanians were a nation and they deserved some autonomy with the Empire. In fact, Albanian historians and politicians were very moderate compared to their peers in neighbouring countries.. Albanians involved in these activities were preoccupied with gathering and identifying evidence, at times inventing facts to justify claims to \\"prove\\" the cultural distinctiveness and historical legitimacy of the Albanians in being considered as a nation.. Taking their lead from the Italian national movement, the Arb√´resh, (an Albanian diaspora community settled throughout southern Italy from the medieval period) began to promote and spread national ideas by introducing them to Balkan Albanians. Prominent among them were Girolamo de Rada, Giuseppe Schir√≤ and Demetrio Camarda of whom were influenced through literature on Albania by Western scholars and referred within their literary works to a pre-Ottoman past, Skanderbeg, Pyrrhus of Epirus and Alexander the Great.... \\"Writers like Angelo Masci (1758‚Äì 1821), Emanuele Bidera (1784‚Äì 1858), De Rada‚Äôs mentor and teacher, Demetrio Camarda (1821‚Äì82), Giuseppe Crispi (1781‚Äì1859) and Vincenzo Dorsa (1823‚Äì85) were thus among the first to entertain the prospect of an autonomous Albanian nationality, collecting local folklore, turning their ancient Albanian dialect into a written language at a time when Albanian still lacked a written form, and building a national pantheon, which included Philip and Alexander the Great of Macedonia, King Pyrrhus of Epirus (fourth century BC) and Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg (1405‚Äì68). They did so under the influence of works by Western scholars on Albania, and, more importantly, in the context of the cultural revival associated with the rise of southern Italian patriotism. Calabria and Sicily, where the main Albanian diaspora was settled, were the theatre of major social and political changes in the first decades of the nineteenth century.\\" While Muslim (especially Bektashi) Albanians were heavily involved with the Albanian National Awakening producing many figures like Faik Konitza, Ismail Qemali, Midhat Frash√´ri, Shahin Kolonja and others advocating for Albanian interests and self-determination.... para. 19, 26.. The Bektashi Sufi order of the late Ottoman period in Southern Albania also played a role during the Albanian National Awakening by cultivating and stimulating Albanian language and culture and was important in the construction of national Albanian ideology..... Among Catholic Albanian figures involved were Prenk Do√ßi, Gjergj Fishta and Pashko Vasa who penned the famous poem Oh Albania which called for Albanians overcoming religious divisions through a united Albanianism.. The last stanza of Vasa's poem Feja e shqyptarit asht shqyptarija (The faith of the Albanian is Albanianism) became during the national awakening period and thereafter a catchword for Albanian nationalists.. \\"Feja e shqyptarit asht shqyptarija (The faith of the Albanian is Albanianism) which was to become a catchword of Albanian nationalists both in the Rilindja period and later. = Myth of Skanderbeg = Skanderbeg Monument in Tirana. Another factor overlaying geopolitical concerns during the National Awakening period were thoughts that Western powers would only favour Christian Balkan states and peoples in the anti Ottoman struggle. During this time Albanian nationalists attempting to gain Great Power sympathies and support conceived of Albanians as a European people who under Skanderbeg resisted Ottoman Turks that later subjugated and cut the Albanians off from Western European civilisation.. As such, the Skanderbeg myth presented Albanians as defending Europe from the \\"Asian hordes\\" and allowed Albanians to develop the myth of Albanian resistance to foreign enemies that threatened the \\"fatherland\\" and the unity of the Albanian nation. Albanian nationalists needed an episode from medieval history to centre Albanian nationalist mythology upon and chose Skanderbeg in the absence of a medieval kingdom or empire.. \\"..an episode taken from medieval history was central for Albanian national mythology. In the absence of medieval kingdom or empire the Albanian nationalists choose Skanderbeg...\\" From the 15th to the 19th century Skanderbeg's fame survived mainly in Christian Europe and was based on a perception of Skanderbeg's Albania serving as Antemurale Christianitatis (a barrier state) against \\"invading Turks\\".. In Albania, largely Islamicized during this period, Skanderbeg's fame faded and was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century when that figure was brought to the level of national myth.. Another measure for nationalists promoting the Skanderbeg myth among Albanians was for them to turn their backs on their Ottoman heritage which was viewed as being the source of the Albanians' predicament. Skanderbeg's Christian identity was avoided and he was presented mainly as a defender of the nation... Albanian nationalist writers transformed Skanderbeg's figure and deeds into a mixture of historical facts, truths, half-truths, inventions, and folklore.. \\"The nationalist writers... transform history into myth ... As with most myths his figure and deeds became a mixture of historical facts, truths, half-truths, inventions and folklore.\\" = Hellenism, Orthodoxy and Albanian nationalism = For Orthodox Albanians, Albanianism was closely associated with Hellenism, linked through the faith of Orthodoxy and only during the Eastern crisis and thereafter was that premise rejected by a few Orthodox Albanianists. In southern Albania during the late Ottoman period being Albanian was increasingly associated with Islam, while from the 1880s the emerging Albanian National Movement was viewed as an obstacle to Hellenism within the region.. \\"Œó Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±œÉŒØŒ± Œ±œÖœÑŒÆ œÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒæŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπœÉŒºŒøœç œÑœâŒΩ ŒøœÅŒ∏œåŒ¥ŒøŒæœâŒΩ œÄŒµœÅŒπŒøœáœéŒΩ, ŒªŒµŒπœÑŒøœÖœÅŒ≥œéŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ Œ±ŒΩœÑŒØœÉœÑœÅŒøœÜŒ± œÄœÅŒøœÇ ŒµŒ∫ŒµŒØŒΩŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒæŒπœÉŒªŒ±ŒºŒπœÉŒºŒøœç, ŒµœÄŒπœÑŒ±œáœçŒΩŒµŒπ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÑŒ±œçœÑŒπœÉŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±ŒªŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œøœç œÉœÑŒøŒπœáŒµŒØŒøœÖ ŒºŒµ œÑŒø ŒºŒøœÖœÉŒøœÖŒªŒºŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœå, œÉœÑŒøŒπœáŒµŒØŒø œÄŒøœÖ Œ∏' Œ±œÄŒøŒ≤ŒµŒØ Œ±œÄŒøœÜŒ±œÉŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œå œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµŒæŒ≠ŒªŒπŒæŒ∑ œÑœâŒΩ ŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ œÉœÖŒ≥Œ∫œÅŒøœçœÉŒµœâŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ œÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÖœÇ œÑŒøœÖ 19ŒøœÖ Œ±ŒπœéŒΩŒ±.

[The main enemy of Hellenism from the 1880s onward was the Albanian idea, slowly but firmly dismissed the possibility of serious Greek-Albanian cooperation and rendered inevitable the future dismemberment of Epirus.]\\" Some Orthodox Albanians mainly from Kor√ß√´ and its regions began to affiliate with the Albanian National movement by working together with Muslim Albanians regarding shared social, geopolitical Albanian interests and aims causing concerns for Greece.. \\"The Greeks too sought to curtail the spread of nationalism amongst the southern Orthodox Albanians, not only in Albania but also in the Albanian colonies in America.\\".. \\"Most of the Tosk Orthodox patriots came from Kor√ß√´ and its regions.\\" Contribution to the national movement by Orthodox Albanian nationalists was mainly undertaken outside the Ottoman state in the Albanian diaspora with activities focusing on educational issues and propaganda.. \\"The Orthodox nationalists were mainly active outside the Ottoman Empire. They made their greatest contribution to the national cause (mainly educational and propaganda work) through the Albanian colonies.\\" As Orthodoxy was associated with Greek identity, the rise of the Albanian national movement caused confusion for Orthodox Albanians as it interrupted the formation of a Greek national consciousness.. \\"The Orthodox Christian Albanians, who belonged to the rum millet, identified themselves to a large degree with the rest of the Orthodox, while under the roof of the patriarchate and later the influence of Greek education they started to form Greek national consciousness, a process that was interrupted by the Albanian national movement in the 19th century and subsequently by the Albanian state.\\"; p. 153. \\"The influence of Hellenism on the Albanian Orthodox was such that, when the Albanian national idea developed, in the three last decades of the 19th century, they were greatly confused regarding their national identity.\\" In some areas, bitter schisms emerged among the Orthodox population as local pro- Greek and pro-Albanian factions confronted each other. This was especially the case in Lunxh√´ri, an Albanophone Orthodox region near the Greek border in Gjirokaster County. In the early 1800s, Western European travelers remarked that, going north from ethnically Greek Delvinaki, it \\"felt like a different country\\" whose people had different customs, and that the locals themselves believed that \\"Albania... the native country of the Albanians, begins from the town of Delvinaki.\\"De Rapper, Gilles (2008). Better than Muslims, not as Good as Greeks: Emigration as Imagined and Experienced by the Albanian Christians of Lunxheri. Page 10. \\"The dress of the peasants was now changed from the loose woollen brogues of the Greeks, to the cotton kamisa, or kilt of the Albanian, and in saluting Vasilly they no longer spoke Greek... a notion prevails amongst the people of the country, that Albania, properly so called, or at least, the native country of the Albanians, begins from the town of Delvinaki\\" In that century, the region produced many prominent Albanian patriots and nationalist activists such as Koto Hoxhi, Vangjel and Kristo Meksi, Petro Poga, Pandeli Sotiri and Kosta Boshnjaku, but also powerful Grecophiles such as Zografos, the leader of the North Epirote insurgency (there were also those who were simultaneously Albanists and Hellenists, such as Anastas Byku). In the late Ottoman period, powerful Grecophile families forced the departure of many pro-Albanian Christians from the region, with some fleeing to America.De Rapper, Gilles. Better than Muslims, not as Good as Greeks. Page 11. \\"Lunxh√´ri was actually included in the definition of Northern Epirus as a land of Hellenism that should have been given to the Greek state in 1913, and many families left the area, and Albania, during and after the First World War, to avoid becoming citizens of the new Albanian state. These people are called in Albanian propaganda filogrek and seem to have been powerful enough at some times to force pro-Albanian families to leave Lunxh√´ri. It the interwar period for instance, the village of Selck√´ is said to have been ‚Äòfull of filogrek‚Äô and an informant told me the story of her husband‚Äôs father, who secretly left the village one night with his wife, after a cousin told him that his pro-Albanian commitment did not please a powerful pro-Greek family. They left for America, while the pro-Greek family eventually left for Greece.\\" Many local Orthodox Albanian nationalists died for their beliefs: Pandeli Sotiri was murdered by Grecophiles, while Koto Hoxhi was excommunicated and died in jail. After the failure of the North Epirote insurgency, a number of powerful pro-Greek families fled to Greece while some pro-Albanian families returned, and until modern migration to Greece, the remaining population came to mostly identify strongly as Albanian, including families which know they had originally been Grecophones from much further south.De Rapper, Gilles. Better than Muslims, not as Good as Greeks. Page 12. \\"Due to the departures of the filogrek and to the policy of Albanisation undertaken by the Albanian state since its creation, the sense of national [185] belonging in Lunxh√´ri was, until recently, quite clear: not only are the Lunxhots ethnically and nationally Albanian, as opposed to the Greeks and Vlachs, they are even supposed to be the only true Albanians of the area, as opposed to the Muslims of Lab√´ria who are seen as having abandoned their religion to become ‚ÄòTurks‚Äô and, in so doing, have betrayed. The slightest variation from this discourse was suspected of being filogrek. It must be noted that when people leave the question of national identity aside, for instance to tell their family histories, things become much less clear: shifts from one national identity to another are not rare, and they do not seem to be a problem as far as the individual or familial level is concerned. Several families thus acknowledge a Greek origin a few generations ago, others recognise branches that ‚Äòbecame‚Äô Greek just by crossing the border, and so on. This is for instance the case of an informant from Qestorat, who, although being definitely Albanian as far as national identity is concerned, and very critical vis-√†-vis the Greeks, tells the story of his father, arrived from Athens in 1942 and who ‚Äòlearned Albanian here, by himself‚Äô.\\" At the onset of the twentieth century the idea to create an Albanian Orthodoxy or an Albanian expression of Orthodoxy emerged in the diaspora at a time when the Orthodox were increasingly being assimilated by the Patriarchate and Greece through the sphere of politics.. The Orthodox Albanian community had individuals such as Jani Vreto, Spiro Dine and Fan Noli involved in the national movement and some of them advocated for an Albanian Orthodoxy in order to curtail the Hellenisation process occurring amongst Orthodox Albanians.. para. 18, 27-29. In 1905, priest Kristo Negovani who had attained Albanian national sentiments abroad returned to his native village of Negovan and introduced the Albanian language for the first time in Orthodox liturgy. For his efforts Negovani was murdered by a Greek guerilla band on orders from Bishop Karavangelis of Kastoria that aroused a nationalist response with the Albanian guerilla band of Bajo Topulli killing the Metropolitan of Kor√ß√´, Photios.. \\"Negovani‚Äôs actions caused institutional responses that ultimately intensified the contradictions facing the church and its imperial patron. In the end, Papa Kristo Negovani was murdered for his acts of defiance of the explicit orders of Karavangjelis, the Metropolitan of Kastoria, who condemned the use of Tosk√´risht during mass.. \\"The nationalist cause was given impetus in 1905 when the Albanian priest and poet, Papa Kristo Negovani, was killed by Greek chauvinists after he had introduced the Albanian language into Orthodox liturgy.\\". \\"In one case, a guerilla band executed Father Kristo Negovani (1875-1905) on 12 February 1905, two days after he had performed a church service in Albanian. To avenge his death, a guerilla leader named Bajo Topulli (1868-1930) waylaid and murdered Phiotos, the bishop of G√∂rice, in September 1906.. para. 7. \\"Negovani... Au d√©but de l'ann√©e 1905, avec son fr√®re lui aussi pope et trois autres villageois, il est victime d'une bande grecque et devient le premier ¬´ martyr ¬ª de la cause nationale albanaise\\"; para. 8, 26. In 1907, an Orthodox Albanian immigrant Kristaq Dishnica was refused funeral services in the United States by a local Orthodox Greek priest for being an Albanian nationalist. Known as the Hudson incident, it galvanised the emigre Orthodox Albanian community to form the Albanian Orthodox Church under Fan Noli who hoped to diminish Greek influence in the church and counter Greek irredentism..... \\"Noli... Hoping to eliminate Greek influence within the Albanian Orthodox Church, he focused his early activities on translating the church liturgy into Albanian and establishing an independent Albanian Orthodox Church. The latter he considered as vital to Albania's evolution into a unified nation and as a major blow to the supporters of the Greek 'Great Idea'.\\" For Albanian nationalists, Greek nationalism was a concern toward the end of the 19th century due to overlapping territorial claims toward the ethnically mixed vilayet of Yannina. Those issues also generated a reaction against Greek nationalists that drove the Albanian desire to stress a separate cultural identity..\\"However, Greek nationalism continued to be a source of concern for Albanian nationalists later on in the century. After the creation of the Greek state in 1830, and in the light of its mounting expansionist ambitions in the second half of the nineteenth century, the Albanian desire to assert a separate cultural identity represented also a reaction against Greek nationalists, who coveted territories inhabited by Albanians in the Ottoman Balkans, especially in the fiercely contested vilayet of Yiannina, a province containing a mixture of different populations.\\" = Western influences and origin theories = In the 19th century Western academia imparted its influence on the emerging Albanian identity construction process by providing tools that were utilised and transformed in certain contexts and toward goals within a changing environment. This differed from the context from which Western authors had originally generated their theories. Albanian nationalists of the period were educated in foreign schools abroad.. Some 19th century Western academics examining the issue of Albanian origins promoted the now- discredited theory of Albanian descent from ancient Pelasgians.. Developed by the Austrian linguist Johann Georg von Hahn in his work Albanesiche Studien (1854) the theory claimed the Pelasgians as the original proto-Albanians and the language spoken by the Pelasgians, Illyrians, Epirotes and ancient Macedonians being closely related. This theory quickly attracted support in Albanian circles, as it established a claim of precedence over other Balkan nations, the Slavs and particularly the Greeks... In addition to generating a \\"historic right\\" to territory, this theory also established that ancient Greek civilization and its achievements had an \\"Albanian\\" origin. The Pelasgian theory was adopted among early Albanian publicists and used by Italo- Albanians, Orthodox and Muslim Albanians.; p. 114. \\"The Greek propagandists, on the other hand used it in order to attract Albanians to their side.\\". Italo-Albanians being of the Greek rite and their culture having strong ecclesiastical Byzantine influence were not in favour of the Illyrian-Albanian continuity hypothesis as it had overtones of being Catholic and hence Italianate.. \\"We saw that Italo-Albanian scholars in general do not favor the Illyrian-Albanian continuity thesis. Why? Because Italo-Albanian culture has a strong Byzantine imprint. All the aforementioned scholars were followers of the Greek rite... For to them 'Illyrian' has strong overtones of 'Catholic,' and 'Catholic' in turn connotes 'Italianate'.\\" For Italo-Albanians, the origins of the Albanians lay with the Pelasgians, an obscure ancient people that lived during antiquity in parts of Greece and Albania. To validate Albanian claims for cultural and political emancipation, Italo-Albanians maintained that the Albanian language was the oldest in the region than even Greek.. \\"De Rada‚Äôs contribution to the formulation of a theory about the historical origins of the Albanian nation reflected both his concern to emphasize the close association between Italy and Albanian nationalism, and his preoccupation with the distinctiveness of the Albanian nationality as against the Greek. The Italo-Albanians identified the origins of the Albanian nation in the Pelasgian or Pellazg people (otherwise known as Pelasgi in Risorgimento literature), whose history could be traced back to 2000 BC, and whose territories covered parts of Greece, Albania itself, and, further to the west, Italy and Sicily; they stressed the sheer antiquity of the Albanian language, deeming it to be the oldest in the region, even older than Greek, in order to justify their claims to political and cultural emancipation.\\" The theory of Pelasgian origins was used by the Greeks to attract and incorporate Albanians into the Greek national project through references to common Pelasgian descent. The Pelasgian theory was welcomed by some Albanian intellectuals who had received Greek schooling.. \\"These theories were of particular importance in southern Albania, whose territory was disputed between Albanian and Greek nationalisms.... On the Greek side, the Pelasgic theory was at first used to facilitate the incorporation of all Albanians (and other inhabitants of the Balkans) into the Greek national projects as common descendants of the Pelasgians; this theory was at first welcome by some Greek educated Albanian intellectuals (Sigalas 1999: 62-85). On the Albanian side, it supported the claim of priority and ownership of Albanians on the territories they inhabited\\" For Orthodox Albanians such as Anastas Byku a common ancestry of both Albanians and Greeks through Pelasgian ancestors made both peoples the same and viewed the Albanian language as a conduit for Hellenisation.. para. 9, 12-14, 15, 25. For Muslim Albanians like Sami Frash√´ri Albanians stemmed from the Pelasgians, an older population than Illyrians thereby predating the Greeks making for him the Albanians descendants of Illyrians who themselves originated from Pelasgians... Figures originating from the ancient period such as Alexander the Great and Pyrrhus of Epirus were enveloped in myth and claimed as Albanian men of antiquity while Phillip II of Macedon, the ancient Macedonians were Pelasgian or Illyrian- Albanian.. \\"The greatest expansion of Hellenic civilization and rule thus occurred thanks to an 'Albanian' and not a Hellene\\". Albanian writers of the period felt that they had counter arguments that came from the Greek side and from Slavic circles. The Greeks claimed that Albanians did not constitute a people, their language was a mixture of different languages and that an Albanian member of the Orthodox church was \\"really a Greek\\", while Slav publicists claimed that Kosovan Albanians were \\"really\\" Slavs or they were \\"Turks\\" who could be \\"sent back\\" to Anatolia.. \\"The myth of ethnic homogeneity and cultural purity, however, dictated otherwise... That Albanian writers felt the need to argue in this way was easily understandable at a time when Greek propagandists were claiming that the Albanians were not a proper people at all, that their language was just a mish mash of other languages and that any member of the Greek Orthodox Church was 'really' a Greek. At the same time, Slav publicists were insisting either that the Albanians of Kosova were 'really' Slavs, or that they were 'Turks' who could be 'sent back' to Turkey.\\". Apart from Greek nationalism being viewed as a threat to Albanian nationalism, emphasizing an antiquity of the Albanian nation served new political contexts and functions during the 1880s. It also arose from the Albanian need to counter Slavic national movements seeking independence from the Ottomans through a Balkan federation..\\"In the political context of the 1880s, however, emphasis on the antiquity of the Albanian nation served new political purposes, since Greek nationalism was no longer the sole threat to Albanian nationalism. In fact, it was designed to counter also the Slavic national movements, several of which in the 1880s were planning to create a Balkan federation as a means to liberate themselves from the dominion of the Sublime Porte.\\" In time the Pelasgian theory was replaced with the Illyrian theory regarding Albanian origins and descent due it being more convincing and supported by some scholars. The Illyrian theory became an important pillar of Albanian nationalism due to its consideration as evidence of Albanian continuity in territories such as Kosovo and the south of Albania contested with the Serbs and Greeks.. \\"But gradually, while the Albanian national movement matured, the romantic Pelasgian theory and others were replaced by the theory of Illyrian descent, which was more convincing because it was supported by a number of scholars. The Illyrian descent theory soon became one of the principal pillars of Albanian nationalism because of its importance as evidence of Albanian historical continuity in Kosovo, as well as in the south of Albania, i.e in the areas contested by Serbs or Greeks.\\" = Geopolitical consequences and legacy = Unlike their Greek, Serbian and Bulgarian neighbours who had territorial ambitions, Albanians due to being mainly Muslim lacked a powerful European patron. This made many of them want to preserve the status quo and back Ottomanism. By the early 20th century, Albanian nationalism was advanced by a wide-ranging group of Albanian politicians, intellectuals and exiles. An Albanian emigrant community was present in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the majority being illiterate and individuals like Sotir Peci worked to impart a sense of Albanian nationhood among them encouraging the spread of literacy in Albanian. In 1908, an alphabet congress with Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox delegates in attendance agreed to adopt a Latin character-based Albanian alphabet and the move was considered an important step for Albanian unification. Opposition toward the Latin alphabet came from some Albanian Muslims and clerics who with the Ottoman government preferred an Arabic-based Albanian alphabet, due to concerns that a Latin alphabet undermined ties with the Muslim world.... Due to the alphabet matter and other Young Turk policies, relations between Albanian elites and nationalists, many Muslim and Ottoman authorities broke down... The Ottoman Young Turk government was concerned that Albanian nationalism might inspire other Muslim nationalities toward such initiatives and threaten the Muslim-based unity of the empire.. Though at first Albanian nationalist clubs were not curtailed, the demands for political, cultural and linguistic rights eventually made the Ottomans adopt measures to repress Albanian nationalism which resulted in two Albanian revolts toward the end of Ottoman rule. The first revolt was during 1910 in northern Albania and Kosovo reacting toward the new Ottoman government policy of centralization.. The other revolt in the same areas was in 1912 that sought Albanian political and linguistic self-determination under the bounds of the Ottoman Empire and with both revolts many of the leaders and fighters were Muslim and Catholic Albanians... These Albanian revolts were also a turning point that impacted the Young Turk government which increasingly moved from a policy direction of pan-Ottomanism and Islam toward a singular national Turkish outlook... Albanian nationalism during the late Ottoman era was not imbued with separatism that aimed to create an Albanian nation-state, though Albanian nationalists did envisage an independent Greater Albania. Albanian nationalists of the late Ottoman period were divided into three groups. Pan- Albanian nationalists, those who wanted to safeguard Albanian autonomy under an Ottoman state and an Albania divided along sectarian lines with an independent Catholic Albania envisaged mainly by Catholics.. In the late Ottoman period Bektashi Muslims in Albania distanced themselves from Albanian Sunnis who opposed Albanian independence.. Though neglected in Albanian historiography, there were people who came from a Balkan Albanian speaking or cultural space, mainly from urban centres and stemming from the elite who often though not always when migrating to Anatolia did not identify with a concept of Albanianess. Instead they adopted an Ottoman Turkish outlook and came to refer to themselves as Turks or Ottoman Turkish speaking citizens... Due to the effects of socio-linguistic assimilation, promoters of Albanian nationalism became concerned about migration to Anatolia and degraded Albanians from the lower classes who undertook the journey.. The emerging Albanian nationalist elite promoted the use of the Albanian language as a medium of political and intellectual expression.. Policies of national exclusivity by Serbs and Greeks like an abandonment of the common Pelasgian descent theory and stressing the importance of Greek language as a component of Greek nationalism left little room for alternative national affiliations among Albanian Catholics and to an extent Orthodox Albanians.. Non-Muslim Albanians accepted the idea of a multi-faith Albanian nation due to a number of other factors such as a distinct language differing from other Balkan peoples and imagined common Illyrian descent.. Albanian nationalism overall was a reaction to the gradual breakup of the Ottoman Empire and a response to Balkan and Christian national movements that posed a threat to an Albanian population that was mainly Muslim.. Efforts were devoted to including vilayets with an Albanian population into a larger unitary Albanian autonomous province within the Ottoman state. Albanian nationalists were mainly focused on defending rights that were sociocultural, historic and linguistic within existing countries without being connected to a particular polity..\\"Nineteenth-century Albanianism was not by any means a separatist project based on the desire to break with the Ottoman Empire and to create a nationstate. In its essence Albanian nationalism was a reaction to the gradual disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and a response to the threats posed by Christian and Balkan national movements to a population that was predominantly Muslim. In this sense, its main goal was to gather all ‚ÄòAlbanian‚Äô vilayet's into an autonomous province inside the Ottoman Empire. In fact, given its focus on the defence of the language, history and culture of a population spread across various regions and states, from Italy to the Balkans, it was not associated with any specific type of polity, but rather with the protection of its rights within the existing states. This was due to the fact that, culturally, early Albanian nationalists belonged to a world in which they were at home, though poised between different languages, cultures, and at times even states.\\". Unlike other Balkan nationalisms religion was seen as an obstacle and Albanian nationalism competed with it and developed an anti clerical outlook. As Albanians lived in an Ottoman millet system that stressed religious identities over other forms of identification, the myth of religious indifference was formed during the National Awakening as a means to overcome internal religious divisions among Albanians... Promoted as civil religion of sorts, Albanianism as an idea was developed by Albanian nationalists to downplay established religions such as Christianity and Islam among Albanians while a non-religious Albanian identity was stressed.. Within the Albanian movement a few members of the elite promoted other religions as the basis for unity, such as syncretic Bektashi beliefs or the call to adhere to the original faith of the Albanians purported to be based on ancient Pelasgian- Illyrian roots or Christianity.. Overall Albanian nationalists of the period viewed religion as a private matter and stressed the need that Albanians ought to tolerate the differences of other faiths existing among them... Religion did not play a significant role as in other Balkan nationalisms or to mainly become a divisive factor in the formation of Albanian nationalism which resembled Western European nationalisms... The Albanian language instead of religion became the primary focus of promoting national unity... Albanian National Awakening figures during the late Ottoman period generated vernacular literature in Albanian. Often those works were poems which contained nationalist aspirations and political themes which in part secured support for the Albanian nationalist cause when transformed into narrative songs that spread among the male population of Albanian speaking villagers in the Balkans.. Nation building efforts gained momentum after 1900 among the Catholic population by the clergy and members such as craftsmen and traders of the Bektashi and Orthodox community in the south. With a de-emphasis of Islam, the Albanian nationalist movement gained the strong support of two Adriatic sea powers Austria-Hungary and Italy who were concerned about pan-Slavism in the wider Balkans and Anglo-French hegemony purportedly represented through Greece in the area.. \\"Œ†ŒµœÅŒπŒøœÅŒØŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ œÑŒπœÇ Œ±œÅœáŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒπœÉŒªŒ±ŒºŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ ŒµŒæŒ¨œÅœÉŒµŒπœÇ, œÑŒø Œ±ŒªŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œå Œ∫ŒØŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ± ŒµŒæŒ±œÉœÜŒ¨ŒªŒπœÉŒµ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ œÄœÅŒøœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒØŒ± œÑœâŒΩ Œ¥œçŒø ŒπœÉœáœÖœÅœéŒΩ Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ¨ŒºŒµœâŒΩ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒëŒ¥œÅŒπŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ, œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒôœÑŒ±ŒªŒØŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒëœÖœÉœÑœÅŒØŒ±œÇ, œÄŒøœÖ Œ¥ŒÆŒªœâŒΩŒ±ŒΩ Œ≠œÑŒøŒπŒºŒµœÇ ŒΩŒ± Œ∫Œ¨ŒΩŒøœÖŒΩ œå,œÑŒπ ŒºœÄŒøœÅŒøœçœÉŒ±ŒΩ Œ≥ŒπŒ± ŒΩŒ± œÉœéœÉŒøœÖŒΩ œÑŒ± ŒíŒ±ŒªŒ∫Œ¨ŒΩŒπŒ± Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ±œÄŒµŒπŒªŒÆ œÑŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±ŒΩœÉŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒπœÉŒºŒøœç Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒªŒøŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ∫Œ∑Œ¥ŒµŒºŒøŒΩŒØŒ± œÄŒøœÖ œÖœÄŒøœÑŒØŒ∏ŒµœÑŒ±Œπ œåœÑŒπ Œ∏Œ± Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπœÄœÅŒøœÉœéœÄŒµœÖŒµ Œ∑ ŒµœÄŒ≠Œ∫œÑŒ±œÉŒ∑ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±œÇ.

The dissemination of ideas in Albanian Christian population started to become visible and very concerning to Greece].\\". The Austro-Hungarians and Italians supported the development of an Albanian national consciousnesses as a precursor for the creation of an Albanian state and devoted assistance toward that aim mainly among Albanian Catholics..  Independence, Interwar period and World War Two (1912-1944)  = Independence = The imminence of collapsing Ottoman rule through military defeat during the Balkan wars pushed Albanians represented by Ismail Qemali to declare independence (28 November 1912) in Vlor√´ from the Ottoman Empire. The main motivation for independence was to prevent Balkan Albanian inhabited lands from being annexed by Greece and Serbia.. Italy and Austria-Hungary supported Albanian independence due to their concerns that Serbia with an Albanian coast would be a rival power in the Adriatic Sea and open to influence from its ally Russia......... Apart from geopolitical interests, some Great powers were reluctant to include more Ottoman Balkan Albanian inhabited lands into Albania due to concerns that it would be the only Muslim dominated state in Europe.. Russo-French proposals were for a truncated Albania based on central Albania with a mainly Muslim population, which was also supported by Serbia and Greece who considered that only Muslims could be Albanians (and not even all Albanophone Muslims necessarily).. \\"Benckendorff, on the other hand, proposed only a truncated coastal strip to form a central Muslim dominated Albania, in accordance with the common view amongst Slavs, and also Greeks, that only Muslims could be considered Albanian (and not even Muslims necessarily).\\" As more Albanians became part of the Serbian and Greek states, Albanian scholars with nationalistic perspectives interpret the declaration of independence as a partial victory for the Albanian nationalist movement. After recognising Albanian independence and its provisional borders in 1913, the Great powers imposed on Albania a Christian German prince Wilhelm of Wied to be its ruler in 1914. In the ensuring power struggles and disquiet over having a Christian monarch, a failed Muslim uprising (1914) broke out in central Albania that sought to restore Ottoman rule while northern and southern Albania distanced themselves from those events.. During this period and that of the early 20th century most Orthodox Albanians in southern Albania supported the unification of the area with Greece and were opposed to living in an Albania under leaders composed of Muslim Albanians.. \\"The political thinking of the Orthodox Albanians was divided into two categories. Those who lived in Albania were dominated by Greek influence. The majority of them- especially the notables-desired union with Greece. The Orthodox Christians in general had an intense hatred of Ottoman rule. Although this feeling was shared by their co-religionists who lived in the colonies abroad, their political thinking was different.\\". \\"The Orthodox Christians did not have the same reasons to support Albanian nationalism. They remained faithful to 'Romanity' asking union with Greece, the Orthodox State. Only the Orthodox Christians from or abroad supported nationalism, as they were affected by the modern nationalistic ideas of Europe and the United States of America. Thus, the Orthodox Christians, either Albanian or Greek-speaking supported, their majority, the Greek claims at this stage of the beginning of the 20th century.\\".\\"It is true that most of its inhabitants, though not all, spoke Albanian rather than Greek as their first language at home, and it is clear that it was the factor which principally influenced the Boundary Commission. On the other hand Greeks naturally made much of this fact, and it is true that in Northern Epirus loyalty to an Albania with a variety of Muslim leaders competing in anarchy cannot have been strong.\\" On the eve of independence the bulk of Albanians still adhered to pre-nationalist categories like religious affiliation, family or region. Both highlanders and peasants were unprepared for a modern nation state and it was used as an argument against Albanian statehood. With the alternative being partition of Balkan Albanian inhabited lands by neighbouring countries, overcoming a fragile national consciousness and multiple internal divisions was paramount for nationalists like state leader Ismail Qemali. Developing a strong Albanian national consciousness and sentiment overrode other concerns such as annexing areas with an Albanian population like Kosovo.. Albania during World War One was occupied by foreign powers and they pursued policies which strengthened expressions of Albanian nationalism especially in Southern Albania. Italian and French authorities closed down Greek schools, expelled Greek clergy and pro-Greek notables while allowing Albanian education with the French sector promoting Albanian self- government through the Kor√ß√´ republic.. Another factor that reinforced nationalistic sentiments among the population was the return of 20-30,000 Orthodox Albanian emigrants mainly to the Kor√ß√´ region who had attained Albanian nationalist sentiments abroad.. The experience of World War One, concerns over being partitioned and loss of power made the Muslim Albanian population support Albanian nationalism and the territorial integrity of Albania.. An understanding also emerged between most Sunni and Bektashi Albanians that religious differences needed to be sidelined for national cohesiveness. Abandonment of pan-Muslim links abroad was viewed within the context of securing international support for and maintaining independence with some Muslim Albanian clergy being against disavowing ties with the wider Muslim world.. \\"Most Muslims and Bektashis understood that religious differences had to be played down in the name of common ethnicity and that pan-Islamic ideas had to be rejected and fought, even if some so-called 'fanatical' (Sunni) Muslim leaders in Shkoder and elsewhere preferred solidarity with the rest of the Islamic world. Such an attitude was not conducive to Albanian independence to which the international situation was favourable in 1912 and even after World War I.\\" = Interwar period (1919-1938) = During the 1920s the role of religion was downplayed by the Albanian state who instead promoted Albanianism, a broad civic form of nationalism that looked to highlight ethnonational identity over religious identities.. Orthodox Albanians undertook to implement many reforms due to their previous Ottoman status of being an underclass by desiring to move Albania away from its Muslim Ottoman heritage.. \\"The Orthodox Albanians carried out the most energetic reforms. They wanted to move Albania away from its Muslim, Turkish past in which the Christians were the peasants and constituted the underclass.\\" In Southern Albania, Albanian nationalists (many Orthodox) were the majority in the Kor√ß√´ region, while west of the Vjosa river and in the Gjirokast√´r region the Orthodox Albanian population retained Greek sentiments.. A generational divide emerged among the Orthodox with youth supporting nationalist ideas due to their perceived modern character, while support for Greece remained with older generations. Among the Orthodox a new group the moderates emerged which supported the state and nationalism while holding reservations about being included in Albania and viewed Greece as an alternative option.. In areas such as the Kor√ß√´ region where Orthodox Albanians became affected by Albanian nationalism they moved away from Orthodox church influence and tended to lose their religious identity, while in areas were the Orthodox population was the majority they often retained their religious identity.. A congress of Berat in 1922 was convened to formally lay the foundations of an Albanian Orthodox Church which consecrated Fan Noli as Bishop of Kor√ß√´ and primate of all Albania while the establishment of the church was seen as important for maintaining Albanian national unity... The Patriarchate in Istanbul recognised the independence or autocephaly of the Orthodox Albanian Church in 1937. In northern-central Albania an attempt was made by Albanian Catholics to secede and create the Republic of Mirdita (1921) with Yugoslav support and assistance due to Catholic claims that the Albanian government was going to ban Catholicism and the secessionist move was put down by Albanian troops.... In 1923, an Islamic congress supervised by the Albanian government was convened by Sunni Muslim representatives to consider reforms and among those adopted was a break in ties with the caliphate in Istanbul and to establish local Muslim structures loyal to Albania. Sharia law became subordinated to a new civil law code and Muslims in Albania came under government control. The Bektashi order in 1922 at an assembly of 500 delegates renounced ties with Turkey and by 1925 moved their headquarters to Albania.. The ascension of Ahmet Zog as prime minister (1925) and later king (1929) during the interwar period was marked by limited though necessary political stability. Along with resistance by Zog to interwar Italian political and economic influence in Albania those factors contributed to an environment were an Albanian national consciousness could grow.. Under Zog regional affiliations and tribal loyalties were gradually replaced with a developing form of modern nationalism.. \\"This degree of political stability, limited though it was, did much to create an environment necessary for the growth of an Albanian national consciousness. Zog significantly contributed to the process of replacing tribal loyalty and local and regional pride with a rudimentary form of modern state nationalism.\\" During that time Zog attempted to instill a national consciousness through the scope of a teleological past based upon Illyrian descent, Skanderbeg's resistance to the Ottomans and the nationalist reawakening (Rilindja) of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The myth of Skanderbeg under Zog was used for nation building purposes and his helmet was adopted in national symbols. Zog's concerns during the interwar period about suspected propaganda within foreign run schools, Greek in the south and especially Italian run Catholic ones in the north prompted a complete shutdown which overall was a major set back for nationalism.. Generating mass nationalism was difficult during the interwar period as even in 1939, 80% of Albanians were still illiterate.. Apart from using the title King of the Albanians Zog did not pursue irredentist policies such as toward Kosovo due to rivalries with Kosovan Albanian elites and an agreement recognizing Yugoslav sovereignty over Kosovo in return for support.. Zog's efforts toward the development of Albanian nationalism made the task simpler for leaders that came after him regarding the process of Albanian state and nation building.. By the 1930s Muslim Albanians were divided into three groups. The Elders (T√´ vjet√´r) who were Muslim conservatives, the Young (T√´ rinjt√´) who rejected religion and the Neo-Albanians (Neoshqiptar√´t) who opposed religious sectarianism stressing Albanian identity and culture with some preferring Bektashism due to its links with Albanian nationalism... During the interwar period Catholics viewed the Albanian central government as a Muslim one, while the Orthodox felt that in a political context they were dominated by Muslims.. = World War Two (1939-1944) = On 7 April 1939, Italy headed by Benito Mussolini after prolonged interest and overarching sphere of influence during the interwar period invaded Albania.. Italian fascist regime members such as Count Galeazzo Ciano pursued Albanian irredentism with the view that it would earn Italians support among Albanians while also coinciding with Italian war aims of Balkan conquest.. The Italian occupying force in 1939 was welcomed by most Catholic Albanians who viewed them as their co-religionists.. \\"In 1939, the majority of the Catholics welcomed the Italian occupants, their coreligionists.\\" Italian authorities deemed northern tribal chieftains as being overall politically insignificant and allowed them freedom to run their affairs which damaged emerging Albanian nationalism by undoing Zog's attempts at supplanting local loyalties with state loyalties.. The Italian annexation of Kosovo to Albania was considered a popular action by Albanians of both areas.. In newly acquired territories, non-Albanians had to attend Albanian schools that taught a curricula containing nationalism alongside fascism and were made to adopt Albanian forms for their names and surnames. Members from the landowning elite, liberal nationalists opposed to communism with other sectors of society came to form the Balli Komb√´tar organisation and the collaborationist government under the Italians which all as nationalists sought to preserve Greater Albania... While Italians expressed increased concerns about conceding authority to them.. In time the Italian occupation became disliked by sections of the Albanian population such as the intelligentsia, students, other professional classes and town dwellers that generated further an emerging Albanian nationalism fostered during the Zog years.. The same nationalist sentiments among Albanians which welcomed the addition of Kosovo and its Albanians within an enlarged state also worked against the Italians as foreign occupation became increasingly rejected. Apart from verbal opposition, other responses to the Italian presence eventually emerged as armed insurrection through the Albanian communist party. Italian authorities had misjudged the growth of an Albanian national consciousness during the Zog years with the assumption that Albanian nationalism was weak or could be directed by the Italians.. Regional divisions became heightened when resistance groups with differing agendas emerged in the north and south of Albania which slowed the growth of nationalism. With Italy's surrender in 1943 they became replaced outright in Albania with German forces. German occupational authorities instigated a policy of threatening the collaborationist government with military action, communist ascendancy or loss of autonomy and Kosovo to keep them in line. The Germans like the Italians misunderstood Albanian nationalism with; as a result, Albanian noncommunists lost credibility while the communist partisans appealed to growing Albanian nationalism.. In a post-war setting this meant that groups such as Balli Komb√´tar who had aligned with the Axis powers were unable to take power, while emerging leaders such as communist Enver Hoxha solidified his claim to that role by being a nationalist..  Albanian Nationalism during the People's Republic of Albania (1945‚Äì1991)  . Albania in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War entered into a dependent economic and political relationship with Yugoslavia that sought to bring together and eventually unite the two countries. Within the Albanian communist leadership Ko√ßi Xoxe supported Tito and the Yugoslavs and both disliked Hoxha for being nationalistic. Hoxha later took advantage of the Tito-Stalin split by siding with the Soviets and preserved Albanian independence.. Hoxha emerged as leader of Albania at the end of the war and was left with the task of reconstructing Albania from what foundations remained from the Zog years. Hoxha viewed as his goal the construction of a viable independent Albanian nation state based around a \\"monolithic unity\\" of the Albanian people. Albanian society was still traditionally divided between four religious communities. In the Albanian census of 1945, Muslims (Sunni and Bektashi) were 72% of the population, 17.2% were Orthodox and 10% Catholic.. \\"The census of 1945 showed that the vast majority of society (72%) were Muslims, 17.2% of the population declared themselves to be Orthodox, and 10% Catholics.\\" The support base of the communist party was small and the need to sideline the Kosovo issue resulted in Hoxha resorting to extreme nationalism to remain in power and to turn Albania into a Stalinist state.. Hoxha implemented widespread education reform aimed at eradicating illiteracy and education which became used to impart the regime's communist ideology and nationalism. In Albania nationalism during communism had as its basis the ideology of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. = Nationalist ideology during communism = Nationalism became the basis for all of Hoxha's policies as the war created a \\"state of siege nationalism\\" imbued with the myth that Albanian military prowess defeated Axis forces which became a centrepiece of the regime within the context of education and culture... Other themes of Hoxha's nationalism included revering Skanderbeg, the League of Prizren meeting (1878), the Alphabet Congress (1908), Albanian independence (1912) and founding father Ismail Qemali, the Italian defeat during the Vlora War (1920) and Hoxha as creator of a new Albania.. During communism numerous historians from Albania with nationalist perspectives (Ramadan Marmallaku, Kristo Frasheri, Skender Anamali, Stefanaq Pollo, Skender Rizaj and Arben Puto) intentionally emphasized \\"the Turkish savagery\\" and \\"heroic Christian resistance against\\" the Ottoman state in Albania. Some scholars that resisted those anti-Islamic and anti-Turkish propaganda trends were persecuted while the communist regime highlighted myths related to medieval Albanians by interpreting them as the \\"heroic Illyrian proletariat\\". Within that context Hoxha preserved national monuments in urban areas with some settlements being designated as museum cities and he also stressed the need to preserve cultural heritage, folk songs, dances and costumes. Hoxha created and generated a cultural environment that was dominated by doctrinal propaganda stressing nationalism in the areas of literature, geography, history, linguistics, ethnology and folklore so people in Albania would have a sense of their past. The effects among people were that it instilled isolationism, xenophobia, slavophobia, linguistic uniformity and ethnic compactness.. = Origin theories during communism = Albanian nationalism stresses the continuity between Albanians and the ancient Illyrians. Imitating Stalinist trends in the Communist Bloc, Albania developed its own version of protochronist ideology, which stressed the national superiority and continuity of Albanians from ancient peoples such as the Illyrians.. \\"Protochronism became an enormously popular idea in Romanian culture in the 1970s and 1980s... Protochronism, of course had been seen before, in the Soviet claims of the 1940s... Romania was essentially importing a version of high Stalinism: a politics of hierarchy and discipline was wedded to an economics of industrialization and an ideology of nationalism. It was joined in this strategy by Albania\\".. \\"The official doctrine that Ceau»ôescu adopted was called Dacianism, Romania is not the only country to invoke its ancient roots when it comes to show national superiority, Albania also emphasized its Thraco-Illyrian origin.\\" At first the issue of Albanian ethnogenesis was an open question for Albanian scholarship in the 1950s. Hoxha personally supported the Pelasgian theory though officially intervened on the matter by declaring Albanian origins to be Illyrian (without excluding Pelasgian roots) and ended further discussion on the subject.. \\"but when Enver Hoxha declared that their origin was Illyrian (without denying their Pelasgian roots), no one dared participate in further discussion of the question\\". Albanian archaeologists were directed by Hoxha (1960s onward) to follow a nationalist agenda that focused on Illyrians and Illyrian-Albanian continuity with studies published on those topics used as communist political propaganda that omitted mention of Pelasgians.. \\"Although Enver Hoxha himself supported the Pelasgic theory in his own writings (Cabanes 2004: 119), the directions he gave to Albanian archaeologists in the 1960s focused on the Illyrians and on the Illyrian-Albanian continuity. As a result, studies on the origin of Illyrians and Albanians published at that time do not even mention the Pelasgians.\\" Emphasizing an autochthonous ethnogenesis for Albanians, Hoxha insisted on Albanian linguists and archeologists to connect the Albanian language with the extinct Illyrian language. The emerging archeological scene funded and enforced by the communist government stressed that the ancestors of the Albanians ruled over a unified and large territory possessing a unique culture. Toward that endeavour Albanian archaeologists also claimed that ancient Greek poleis, ideas, culture were wholly Illyrian and that a majority of names belonging to the Greek deities stemmed from Illyrian words. Albanian publications and television programs (1960s onward) have taught Albanians to understand themselves as descendants of \\"Indo- European\\" Illyrian tribes inhabiting the western Balkans from the second to third millennium while claiming them as the oldest indigenous people in that area and on par with the Greeks. Physical anthropologists also tried to demonstrate that Albanians were biologically different from other Indo- European populations, a hypothesis now refuted through genetic analysis... = Nationalism and religion = The communist regime through Albanian nationalism attempted to forge a national identity that transcended and eroded religious and other differences with the aim of forming a unitary Albanian identity. The communists promoted the idea that religious feeling, even in a historic context among Albanians was minimal and that instead national sentiment was always important.. Albanian communists viewed religion as a societal threat that undermined the cohesiveness of the nation.. Within this context religions like Islam and Christianity were denounced as foreign with Muslim and Christian clergy criticised as being socially backward with the propensity to become agents of other states and undermine Albanian interests.. Nationalism was also used as a tool by Hoxha during his struggle to break Albania out of the Soviet bloc. Inspired by Pashko Vasa's late 19th century poem for the need to overcome religious differences through Albanian unity, Hoxha took and exploited the stanza \\"the faith of the Albanians is Albanianism\\" and implemented it literally as state policy.... The communist regime proclaimed that the only religion of the Albanians was Albanianism. In 1967 the communist regime declared Albania the only atheist and non-religious country in the world and banned all forms of religious practice in public... \\"Henceforth, Hoxha announced, the only religion would be \\"Albanianism.\\" Hoxha was using nationalism as a weapon in his struggle to break out of the Soviet bloc.\\" Within the space of several months the communist regime destroyed 2,169 religious buildings (mosques, churches and other monuments) while Muslim and Christian clergy were imprisoned, persecuted and in some cases killed.... The Catholic Church of Albania in particular bore the brunt of the regime's violent anti-religious campaign as Hoxha viewed it as a tool of the Vatican and Albanian Catholics as less patriotic than the Orthodox and Muslims.. \\"The persecution of the Catholic clergy by the Tirana government was more drastic than that aimed at the Muslims or Orthodox church, primarily because the Catholic Church in Albania was viewed as an instrument of the Vatican. Hoxha viewed Catholics as less patriotic than either Muslims or Orthodox Christians.\\" The communist regime through policy destroyed the Muslim way of life and Islamic culture within Albania.. \\"The sophisticated culture, literature and art of Islam were ignored by the generality of historians who hardly even tried to conceal their anti-Muslim bias. Their ferociously anti- Islamic and anti-Turkish attitude not only obscured and distorted the amazing process of mass conversion of entire Christian communities to Islam, but also provided an intellectual prop for the ultra nationalist policy of ethnic and religious cleansing in Bosnia, Hum (Herzegovina), Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. For against the backdrop of the history of the Balkans, as generally portrayed, what appeared as a kind of historical exoneration and an act of retaliation for the 'betrayal' of Christianity in the Middle Ages. The policy of destroying Islamic culture and way of life in Albania after the World War II is the primary reason why the history of medieval Islam in this land has not been properly studied. And when it was studied, it was studied within the parameters of the Stalinist ideology which emphasized only the mythical image of medieval Albanians as the 'heroic Illyrian proletariat'. The handful of Muslim scholars in the Communist Eastern Europe who resisted the anti-Islamic and anti-Turkish propaganda were ostracized and often penalized. Albanian nationalist historians like Ramadan Marmallaku, Kristo Frash√´ri, Skender Anamali, Stefanaq Pollo, Skender Rizaj and Arben Puto in their books deliberately emphasized ad nauseam only 'the Turkish savagery' and the 'heroic' Christian resistance against the Osmanli state in Albania.\\" Though Muslim Albanians were affected, the Orthodox community made up of Albanians, Macedonians, Aromanians and Greeks was affected more due to the Ottoman legacy of Orthodox identity being associated with religious practice and language. = Name changes = Within the context of anti religion policies the communist regime ordered in 1975 mandatory name changes, in particular surnames for citizens in Albania that were deemed \\"inappropriate\\" or \\"offensive from a political, ideological and moral standpoint\\". The regime insisted that parents and children attain non religious names that were derived from Albanian mythological figures, geographical features and newly coined names.. These names were often ascribed a supposedly \\"Illyrian\\" and pagan origin while given names associated with the Muslim tradition or Christianity were strongly discouraged.. \\"One by-product of the regime's anti- religious policy was its concern with the question of people's Muslim and Christian names. Parents were actively discouraged from giving their children names that had any religious association or connotation. From time to time official lists were published with pagan, so called Illyrian or freshly minted names considered appropriate for the new breed of revolutionary Albanians. This trend had originated with the 19th century Rilindja, but it became extreme after 1944, when it became the communist regime's declared doctrine to oust Muslim or Christian given names. Ideologically acceptable names were listed in the Fjalor me emra njer√´zish (1982). These could be native Albanian words like Flutur \\"butterfly\\", ideologically communist ones like Proletare, or \\"Illyrian\\" ones compiled from epigraphy, e.g. from the necropolis at Dyrrhachion excavated in 1958-60. Non-Albanian names were replaced which went alongside the regime's brutal version of Albanian nationalism. These approaches resulted for example in the Albanianisation of toponyms in areas where some Slavic minorities resided through official decree (1966) and of Slavic youth though not outright of the Macedonian community as a whole... The communist regime also pursued a nationalistic anti-Greek policy.. Greeks in Albania were forced to Albanianise their names and choose ones that did not have ethnic or religious connotations resulting in Greek families giving children different names so as to pass for Albanians in the wider population.. Albanian nationalism in the 1980s became an important political factor within the scope of Hoxha's communist doctrines..  Contemporary Albanian nationalism (1992-present)  = Post-communist developments in society and politics= Due to the legacy of Hoxha's dictatorial and violent regime, Albanians in a post communist environment have rejected Hoxha's version of Albanian nationalism. Instead it has been replaced with a weak form of civic nationalism and regionalism alongside in some instances with a certain anti- nationalism that has inhibited the construction of an Albanian civil society.. Within the context of nationalist discourses during the 1990s the governing Albanian Democratic Party regarding European aspirations stressed aspects of Catholicism and as some government members were Muslims made overtures about Islam to join international organisations like the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).. Post-communist Albanian governments view the tenets of the Albanian National Awakening as being a guiding influence for Albania by placing the nation above sociopolitical and religious differences and steering the country toward Euro-Atlantic integration.. Themes and concepts of history from the Zog and later Hoxha era have still continued to be modified and adopted within a post communist environment to fit contemporary Albania's aspirations regarding Europe.. Trends from Albanian nationalist historiography composed by scholars during and of the communist era onward linger on that interpret Ottoman rule as being the \\"yoke\\" period, akin to other Balkan historiographies. The legacy of understanding history through such dichotomies has remained for a majority of Albanians which for example they view Skanderbeg and the anti-Ottoman forces as \\"good\\" while the Ottomans are \\"bad\\".. The Albanian government depicts Skanderbeg as a leader of the Albanian resistance to the Ottomans and creator of an Albanian centralised state without emphasizing his Christian background.. Christian communities in Albania highlight Skanderbeg's Christian heritage, while Muslim and non religious Albanians deemphasize his religious background and mainly view him as a defender of the nation.. Skanderbeg is promoted as an Albanian symbol of Europe and the West.. In a post communist environment among some circles myths based on religion with an anti-Western outlook have been generated that views Muslims as the only \\"true Albanians\\" by celebrating the conversion to Islam as saving Albanians from assimilating into Serbs and Greeks. Some also hold the view that Skanderbeg should not be the national hero as he served the Christians after he betrayed the Ottomans.. The Albanian state emphasizes religious tolerance and coexistence without pressuring its citizens to follow a particular faith. The Albanian political establishment promotes Christian figures over Muslim ones in relation to nation building with the idea of deemphasizing Albania's Islamic heritage to curry favour with the West.. Figures from the Muslim community such as state founder Ismail Qemali is revered by the government and viewed by Albanians as a defender of the nation though their religious background has been sidelined. Tirana International Airport Mother Teresa named after Saint Mother Teresa The figure of Saint Mother Teresa, an Albanian nun known for missionary activities in India has been used for nationalist purposes in Albania.. \\"The huge interest in Mother Teresa of different political, nationalist and religious figures and groups in Albania, Kosova, Macedonia and elsewhere in the Balkans has all the signs of a calculated ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô. Mother Teresa is apparently being used by some circles in the region, after her death as much as when she was alive, to further their political, nationalistic and religious causes.\\"; p.234. Within Albania she is promoted inside and outside Albania by the political elite as an Albanian symbol of the West to enhance the country's international status regarding Euro-Atlantic aspirations and integration.. Some Muslim Albanian circles have expressed that promotion by the Albanian political elite of Mother Teresa in Albanian society has been at the expense of Islam and its heritage while contravening the Albanian government's secularist principles.. Mother Teresa is an important symbol of the Albanian Catholic community, while Muslim Albanians deemphasize her religious background and acknowledge her charitable works.. Albanian nationalism overall is not attached to a particular denomination or religion.. \\"Albanian nationalism is not intrinsically linked with a specific religion or denomination.\\" The ambiguity of Islam and its place and role among Balkan (Muslim) Albanians has limited the ability of it becoming a major component to advance the cause of Great Albania. During the Kosovo crisis (1999) Albania was divided between two positions. The first being an Albanian nationalism motivating Albania to aid and provide refuge for Kosovan Albanian refugees while being a conduit for arming Kosovan Albanians and the second that the country was unable to provide those resources, aid and asylum.. Within the sphere of politics anti-Greek sentiments exist and have for instance been expressed by the nationalist movement turned political party the Red and Black Alliance (AK). Anti-Greek sentiments expressed as conspiracy theories among Albanians are over perceived fears of hellenisation of Albanians through economic incentives creating a \\"time-bomb\\" by artificially raising Greek numbers alongside Greek irredentism toward Southern Albania.. \\"Many Albanians still consider Greece a religious, political and territorial threat and believe that Athens is hellenizing the Albanians by giving them economic privileges for defining themselves as ethnic Greeks... According to this view, true and false ethnic Greeks in Albania may even be a 'time bomb'... because the Greater Greece policy, according to Albanian consipracy theories, is to legitimize an annexation of South Albania by artificially inflating the number of 'Greeks' in Albania... There are conspiracy theories in which the identification with Greek expansionist plans would classify them as potential enemies of the state.. However, while within the context of migration to Greece in a post communist environment, many Orthodox Albanians have expressed that they have Greek origins and declared themselves as Northern-Epirots ( Vorioipirotes, ) which is synonymous with Greek identity,. \\"The geographical and cultural proximity of the two areas on the two sides of the border, the composite character of ethnic relationships, the historical background of the social and economic relations involved but also of the translocations and relocations from one area to the other, the fluidity of identities in the past but, to a certain degree, in the present as well, with respect to a large part of Albanian population (mainly the Orthodox Christians), do not allow us to approach the migrational phenomenon in nationalist terms, namely assuming a national purity and homogeneity, which presupposes the existence of nationalism identities, consolidated in time and space and coinciding with the territorial ground of the nation-states\\"; p.171. \\"I keep hearing here in the south, mostly from Orthodox Albanians that they are of Greek origin\\"; p. 466. \\"When they mention their national identity they are very careful. They never define themselves directly as Greek and use the terms ‚ÄúNorthern Epirote‚Äù or ‚ÄúOrthodox‚Äù instead. The term ‚ÄúNorthern Epirote‚Äù is particularly convenient in its ambiguity, but they prefer it because they know it means ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù to the Greeks. This way they both appear honest and achieve their goal without falling into the trap of denying the true identity. This is actually the case with the majority of the Orthodox Christians of the Albanian south.\\" as Greeks are given pensions and preferential treatment in emigration; however, it has been noted that many of the same Orthodox Albanians who are claiming \\"North Epirote\\" identity or even forging documents to present themselves as Greek minority members also voice strong Albanian nationalist views,De Rapper, Gilles. Better than Muslims, not as Good as Greeks. Page 18: \\"It is also striking that people who most openly claim an Albanian identity and loyalty to the Albanian nation are at the same time making attempts to get forged certificates of Greek nationality!\\" and furthermore that Muslim Albanians from regions such as Devoll have converted to Orthodoxy and changed their names to Greek as they emigrated, drawing the mockery of their Albanian Orthodox neighbors who did not emigrate and insist on a solely Albanian identity.De Rapper, Gilles. Better than Muslims, not as good as Greeks. Page 2: \\"Villagers told me about people from the closest Muslim village, down in the valley: ‚ÄòLook at them, down there. At the time of the cooperative, they used to insult us by calling us ‚Äúdamned Greeks‚Äù, ‚Äúbloody Greeks‚Äù. But today they all work in Greece and have Greek names, while we did not go to Greece. Who is Greek then?‚Äô As a matter of fact, people from the Christian villages ‚Äì who insist on their Albanian national identity and refuse to be called Greek ‚Äì have been moving to the town and even more to the United States, where they retain links dating back to the time of the pre-World War II migration known as kurbet. Meanwhile, their Muslim neighbours started in the early 1990s to migrate to Greece, where most of them changed their names and some converted to Orthodoxy.\\" Some Albanians are in favour of Albania being more self- assertive and having a more ethnonationalist strategy toward the \\"Greek issue\\".. \\"However as with the 'Greek issue' above, a considerable number of Albania's citizens at any rate seem to call for a more self-assertive, ethnonationalist strategy than their politicians do.\\" During the Euro 2016 tournament and the 2020 PDIU gathering, a banner was raised by Albanian fans claiming that \\"Greece has committed a genocide against 100.000 Cham Albanians\\", a claim which was rejected by Greece's Foreign Minister of that time, Nikos Kotzias, by stating that the Cham minority's total population was 18.000 at the time. Various organizations and parties corncerned with the Cham issue organize annual events and gatherings, and in some cases protests against the government. = Greater Albania and Albanian politics = Official ensign of the Albanian National Army Political parties advocating and willing to fight for a Greater Albania emerged in Albania during the 2000s. They were the National Liberation Front of Albanians (KKCMTSH) and Party of National Unity (PUK) that both merged in 2002 to form the United National Albanian Front (FBKSh) which acted as the political organisation for the Albanian National Army (AKSh) militant group. Regarded internationally as terrorist both have gone underground and its members have been involved in various violent incidents in Kosovo, Serbia and Macedonia during the 2000s... In the early 2000s, the Liberation Army of Chameria (UCC) was a reported paramilitary formation that intended to be active in northern Greek region of Epirus... Political parties active only in the political scene exist that have a nationalist outlook are the monarchist Legality Movement Party (PLL), the National Unity Party (PBKSh) alongside the Balli Komb√´tar, a party to have passed the electoral threshold and enter parliament. These political parties, some of whom advocate for a Greater Albania, have been mainly insignificant and remained at the margins of the Albanian political scene. Another nationalist party to have passed the electoral threshold is the Party for Justice, Integration and Unity (PDIU) which focuses on issues relevant to the Cham Albanian community regarding property and other issues related to their Second World War exile from northern Greece... The current socialist prime minister Edi Rama in coalition with the PDIU has raised the Cham issue, while at PDIU gatherings made comments about ancient Greek deities and references to surrounding territories as being Albanian earning stern rebukes from Greece.Œ†œÅŒøŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ ŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ Œ∫ŒøœÅœéŒΩŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ°Œ¨ŒºŒ± œÉœÑŒø Œ£œÖŒΩŒ≠Œ¥œÅŒπŒø œÑœâŒΩ Œ§œÉŒ¨ŒºŒ∑Œ¥œâŒΩ.

Retrieved 12 March 2017. The Kosovo question has limited appeal among Albanian voters and are not interested in electing parties advocating redrawn borders creating a Greater Albania.. Centenary Albanian independence celebrations in 2012 generated nationalistic commentary among the political elite of whom prime-minister Sali Berisha referred to Albanian lands as extending from Preveza (in northern Greece) to Pre≈°evo (in southern Serbia), angering Albania's neighbors.. Greater Albania remains mainly in the sphere of political rhetoric and overall Balkan Albanians view EU integration as the solution to combat crime, weak governance, civil society and bringing different Albanian populations together... = Influence of origin theories in contemporary society and politics = Within the sphere of Albanian politics, the Illyrians are officially regarded as the ancestors of the Albanians.. Catholic Albanians are generally in favour of the Illyrian theory, while Orthodox Albanians do not support it due to associations with the Illyrian movement of Catholic Croats or Roman heritage, and they do not oppose it openly as power is held mainly by Muslim Albanians.. \\"Byzantinism pervades the culture of the Albanian Orthodox: their folklore, their traditions and legends, their monasteries and churches. It shows up in the toponymy of many of their villages and towns, in some of their customs, and also their names. This explains the deeply rooted disaffection for Western civilization and, in the language area, their resistance to the Illyrian-Albanian continuity. Illyria to them means the Roman Illyricum, and Illyrism the Croatian revival movement of the same name. Yet, since the power belongs to Moslems, and Moslems in general - and Catholics as a whole - are for the Illyrian origin theory, Byzantine Albanians do not dare to oppose them openly.\\" The Illyrian theory continues to influence Albanian nationalism, scholarship and archeologists as it is seen as providing some evidence of continuity of an Albanian presence in Kosovo, western Macedonia and southern Albania, i.e., areas that were subject to ethnic conflicts between Albanians, Serbs, Macedonians and Greeks... For some Albanian nationalists claiming descent from Illyrians as the oldest inhabitants of the Western Balkans allows them to assert a \\"prior claim\\" to sizable lands in the Balkans.. \\"they thus claim to be the oldest indigenous people of the western Balkans\\". Greek and Roman figures from antiquity such as Aristotle, Pyrrhus of Epirus, Alexander the Great and Constantine the Great are also claimed.. \\"They claimed that Alexander the Great and Aristotle were of Albanian descent.\\". \\"Pyrrhus who lived a century later has been hailed as primary Albanian hero\\". Ismail Kadare Those from the elite like Ismail Kadare, a prominent Albanian novelist, has repeated in his writings themes from communist nationalistic Albanian historiography about Albanian closeness to ancient Greeks based on Homeric ideals, claiming that the Albanians are more Greek than the Greeks themselves, and initiating debates on Albanian identity claiming Albanians as being a white people and Islam as foreign.. \\"Beyond the claims of Illyrian descent and continuity a more powerful myth emerges here: that the Albanians are more Greek than the Greeks themselves because Albanians are closer to Homeric society and Homeric ideals.\\" Rejected by modern scholarship, during the late 1990s and early 2000s the Pelasgian theory has been revived through a series of translated foreign books published on Albania and other related topics and plays an important role in Albanian nationalism today.. Among them are authors such as Robert D'Ang√©ly, Edwin Everett Jacques and Mathieu Aref, whose works have revitalised 19th century ideas about Albanian descent from the ancient Pelasgians and Europeans being a \\"white race\\" originating from them. Another notable book is by the Arvanite activist Aristeidis Kollias, which rehabilitated in post-dictatorial Greek society the Arvanites (a community in Southern Greece descended from medieval Albanian settlers who today self identify as Greeks) by claiming alongside the Greeks a shared Pelasgian origin and that many Greek words had an Albanian etymology. In an Albanian context this book has been used by Albanians in Albania and Albanian immigrants in Greece as a tool to rehabilitate themselves as an ancient and autochthonous population in the Balkans to \\"prove\\" the precedence of Albanians over Greeks. The book has been used to legitimise the presence of Albanians in Greece by claiming a prominent role by Albanians in the emergence of ancient Greek civilisation and later in the creation of the Greek state, so as to counter the negative image of their communities.. The revival of the alternative Pelasgian theory has occurred within the context of post-communist Greek-Albanian relations to generate cultural hegemony and historical precedence over the Greeks and sometimes toward other (historical) European cultures by Albanians.. \\"They state that the Pelasgians were spread all over Europe and the Mediterranean: according to those authors, all ancient civilisations in Europe (Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Celtic, etc.) stemmed from the Pelasgic civilisation. They were the first Europeans; their direct descendants, the Albanians, are thus the most ancient and most authentically European people.\\". Albanian schoolbooks, mainly in relation to language, have also asserted at times that the Illyrians are the heirs of the Pelasgians.. \\"Schoolbooks however differ on what they assert on the relation between Pelasgians and Illyrians: the latter are sometimes said to be the heirs of the former, especially with regard to their language (Kuri, Zekolli & Jubani 1995: 32-33).\\". In 2011 research conducted by Austrian linguists Stefan Schumacher and Joachim Matzinger caused controversy in Albania due to the fact that they accepted that Albanian does not originate from the language of the ancient Illyrians. Although this connection has long been supported by Albanian nationalists and is still taught in Albania from primary school through to university, it does not receive universal acceptance. However, the theory retains many supporters among Albanian academics. The purportedly Illyrian names that the communist regime generated continue to be used today and to be considered of Illyrian origin. The museum in the capital, Tirana, has a bust Pyrrhus of Epirus next to the bust of Teuta (an Illyrian), and under that of Scanderbeg, a medieval Albanian. = Contemporary Albanian identity = Throughout the duration of the Communist regime, national Albanian identity was constructed as being irreligious and based upon a common unitary Albanian nationality. This widely spread ideal is still present, though challenged by religious differentiation between Muslim and Christian Albanians which exists at a local level.. \\"It is common in Albania to say that all Albanians, whether Christian or Muslim, are brothers, and that their only religion is their common Albanian nationality. The dogma of national unity as against religious differentiation is at the core of the most widely-spread Albanian national rhetoric. However, this rhetoric is challenged when local society is underpinned by, and conceptualised in terms of, religious differentiation. This is the case in mixed areas, where Muslims and Christians live in separate villages (or in separate neighbourhoods), and both have strong identities as religious communities ‚Äì as in Devoll. In this specific context, religion cannot consist of just being Albanian. On the contrary, people are very well aware of their belonging to a specific religious community, and national identity is rarely thought of outside the basic opposition between Muslims and Christians.\\" In a post communist environment, religious affiliation to either Muslim and Christian groups is viewed within the context of historical belonging (mainly patrilineal) and contemporary social organisation as cultural communities with religious practice playing a somewhat secondary to limited role.. \\"Another crucial dimension of the post-Communist format of secularism is the imprint of decades of Communist-style propaganda in the perceptions and practices of Muslim believers. Almost everywhere in the post- Communist world, forced Communist-style modernization and eviction of religion from the public arena, has led to a certain secularization of the society and a sharp decline in religious practice. Post-Communist citizens seem to embrace religion more as an aspect of ethnic and social identity rather than a belief in the doctrines of a particular organized spiritual community. This is reflected in the gap between the great number of Albanians who choose to identify with religion and the few who attend religious services and serve religious commandments: 98% of Albanians respond that they belong to one of the religious communities; but only 5.5% attend weekly religious services and 50% only celebrate religious ceremonies during poignant moments in life such as birth, marriage and death (University of Oslo 2013). Additionally, post- Communist Albanians appear strongly committed to institutional arrangements that confine religion strictly within the private sphere‚Äîaway from state institutions, schools, the arts and the public sphere more generally (ibid). Such secular attitudes show that post-Communist citizens are in general little receptive to concepts of religion as a coherent corpus of beliefs and dogmas collectively managed by a body of legitimate holders of knowledge, and even less receptive to rigid orthodox prescriptions thereof.\\".. These communities nonetheless possess perceptions of their group and others, with Muslim Albanians viewing themselves as the purest Albanians due to their supposed role in resisting Serbian geopolitical aims and preventing Albanians from being assimilated by other groups,. while Catholic Albanians may view themselves as the purest Albanians due to keeping morals intact with respect to traditional customs such as the Kanun with its codes of law and honour...\\"It is frequently said that how there is no difference between the religions in Albania. While it is true that there is a considerable degree of toleration, indications deriving from this study suggest that religious affiliations plays a significant part in identity formation and therefore in social relations... However the story from the Catholics was very different... there was varying mistrust of the Muslims. Many Catholics expressed resentment of the dominant position of the Muslims during communism and subsequently. Some expressed and underlying dislike of Islam and what they perceived to be its philosophy.\\"; p. 116. \\"However the Muslim position was that Islam had proved to be a vital force in uniting and maintaining the independence of Albania. Without it they would have been subsumed by the Greeks, Serbs or Italians. From this perspective, they believed, Islam formed the basis of Albanian national identity and should provide the foundation upon which its state was constructed... Yet not far below the surface there was a degree of disdain for the Catholics. In Gura, Catholic migrants reported that Muslims called them kaur, a most unpleasant derogatory term used by the Turks to describe Christians.\\"; pp. 116-117. \\"So whatever might be said to the contrary, tensions were observable between Catholics and Muslims. At most basic of levels Gura was segregated into Muslim and Catholics areas. The same situation existed in Shkod√´r where the city was broadly split into neighbourhoods defined by faith with the Roma living on the southern outskirts of town. Yet there were many in the younger generation who did not see religion as being important.\\" Catholic and Orthodox Albanians hold concerns that any possible unification of Balkan areas populated by sizable amounts of Albanian Muslims to the country would lead to an increasing \\"Muslimization\\" of Albania.. Among Albanians and in particular the young, religion is increasingly not seen as important.. Albania's official embrace of a civic framework of nationhood has led to minorities regarding Albania as their homeland and Albanians regarding them as fellow citizens with some differences of views among the young..

From 1899 he worked on steam trawlers. In 1923 he married Dorcas Eastick. He left fishing due to ill health in 1933, and spent some time unemployed as well as doing whatever jobs he could find, including road mending and forestry. He started singing from an early age, learning the songs his grandfather and others sang in the pubs at Winterton, and earning pennies by singing them to the coach parties that visited the village. As a fisherman he learned the songs fellow crew members sang pulling in the nets as well as in singing sessions in pubs in fishing ports the length of Britain. He won a singing competition in Lerwick in the Shetland Islands in 1907. Folk singing career In 1956 Philip Donnellan, then a radio producer for BBC Birmingham, met Sam in a pub. Donellan was looking for traditional singers to take part in radio programs and recorded about 25 songs and speech from Sam in 1957 and 1958, using the material in two programs, \\"Coast and Country: The Wash\\", broadcast in 1957, and \\"Down to the Sea\\", broadcast in 1959. Donellan brought him to the attention of Ewan McColl, Peggy Seeger and Charles Parker who were engaged in producing the first of the innovatory \\"Radio Ballads, which used songs, sound effects and music combined with the voices of people involved in an industry or common experience. Sam Larner took part in the third program in the series, \\"Singing the Fishing\\", about the East Coast fishing industry. Ewan McColl's song The Shoals of Herring, which describes a fisherman's progress from cabin boy to deckhand, largely based on Sam's life, was written for the program. McColl and Seeger recorded more material from Sam, and he performed in their Ballads and Blues Club in London. In 1961 \\"Now is the Time for Fishing\\", an LP using some of the songs and speech they had recorded, was released by Topic Records.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. At the time of its nomination it consisted of four resources, which included three contributing buildings and one non-contributing building. with The three historic buildings housed commercial businesses beginning in an era when this unincorporated community was a settlement of Swedish immigrants. It is not known when the first retail establishment was built here, by the Berg Hardware Store, the frame building furthest to the west, was constructed in 1875. The Sam White General Store, the middle frame building, was completed in 1881. Both of these buildings were moved to their present location when the Farmers Union Exchange was built in 1928. This building type, a frame structure with the \\"boomtown\\" front, was typical of frontier towns and were replaced by brick buildings as the town grew. However, in many small towns in Iowa, this style continued to be the norm. The brick veneer and the aluminum siding above it were added to the front of the building in 1964. The Farmers Union Exchange had been formed after the Anderson and Nelson Store moved their business and their building north to Olds, Iowa. The White store building was joined to the new building for extra space, and the Berg building was used for storage. The store remained in operation until 1976. The complex was acquired by the Swedish Heritage Society for a museum in 1990, and opened the following year. The fourth, and non-contributing building, was built as a garage in 1928. It was converted into a stuga, a small Swedish cottage, by the museum so visitors could see what immigrants to this community left behind in the old country.

Members prominent in the American Revolution were Henry Ludington and Sybil Ludington. Additionally, Lewis, James, Nelson, and Harrison Ludington were involved in the establishment and development of cities in the states of New York, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Henry founded Kent, New York, in 1775; Lewis founded Columbus, Wisconsin, in 1844; James founded Ludington, Michigan, in 1859; and Nelson founded Escanaba, Michigan, in 1862. Harrison was involved in the development of Milwaukee and was a governor of Wisconsin.  Origins  Historian La Reiana Rule says the American name Ludington is of English origin from Luddington. She believes ancestors of the American Ludingtons were in towns in England from the 10th century. Her research indicates the name \\"Leodingtun\\" signifies \\"estate of the compatriot's family\\". Lion Passant Guardant Historian Willis Fletcher Johnson says the American surname Ludington is also spelled Luddington, Ludinton, and Ludenton. He believes this family originated from the 16th-century Ludingtons of Shrawley and Worcester in England. Tradition has it that a Ludington was a follower of Richard the Lionheart in the Third Crusade and helped him escape prison. This Ludington soldier received nobility status and a family coat of arms for his efforts. The coat of arms is colored in argent, azure, and gules, and emblazoned with a lion passant guardant and a crest featuring a palmer's staff. The motto reads: (Honor not penitence). Johnson says the earliest record of a Ludington in America is from April 6, 1635. On that date the ship Hopewell sailed from London for Massachusetts Bay with seven boys and four girls ranging from 12 to 22 years of age. William Bundock was the captain of the ship, which had already made several previous voyages to America. Among the people on the Hopewell passenger list was a \\"Christiom\\" Ludington. However, there are no confirmed records of any history about her. There is also a mention of a Christopher Ludington in the Virginia colony prior to 1635, also with no confirmed history records. The first confirmed Ludingtons in America are William (1608‚Äì1663) and his wife Ellen (b. 1617), and they are considered the American progenitors.  Genealogy  = William Ludington = William Ludington and his wife Ellen are of unknown English origin, but are considered the base foundation of the American Ludingtons since there are confirmed history records on them. They were married in England about 1636. They immigrated to America about 1639 and settled in Charlestown, Massachusetts, which later became Malden, Massachusetts. Court records of 1640 show that William built his residence outside the city limits, which was illegal, and was issued a high fine for the infraction. The fine was rescinded because about this same time the law was repealed. William and Ellen raised seven children (the first born in England). After raising their children they moved to New Haven, Connecticut, around 1660, where William died shortly thereafter, as his widow remarried on May 5, 1663, to John Rose. Williams will was probated May 25, 1663. Thomas was their first child, born in 1637 in England and raised in Charlestown. In 1666 Thomas moved to Newark, New Jersey, and became a farmer. Their second child was John, born at Charlestown, in 1640. He was living in East Haven, Vermont, in 1664. Their third child was Mary, born either on December 6, 1642, December 6, 1642‚Äì43, February 6, 1643, or February 6, 1642‚Äì43 ‚Äì depending if the Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar is used for recording (as the British colonies in America did in the eighteenth century). Their fourth child was Henry, birth date unknown, who was killed in King Philip's War of 1675‚Äì76. Their fifth child was Hannah, whose birth and death dates are unknown. Their sixth child was William II, born about 1655 and had two wives. William and Ellen's seventh child was Matthew, who died as a baby within 30 days. William II was a successful businessman and married twice. His first wife was Martha Rose, daughter of John Rose and granddaughter of Robert Rose. Their children were: Henry, born 1679; Eleanor, birth date unknown (circa 1683) and married in 1714. His second wife was Mercy Whitehead and their children were: twins Mary and Mercy, born 1691; Hannah, born 1693; John, born 1694; Eliphalet, born 1697; Elizabeth, born 1699; Dorothy, born 1702; and Doreas, born 1704. The second son of Henry (b. 1679) was William III, born at Branford, Connecticut on September 6, 1702. He married Mary Knowles, of Branford, Connecticut, on November 5, 1730. They had eight children, Submit, Mary, Henry, Lydia, Samuel, Rebecca, Anne, and Stephen. Mary Knowles died on April 16, 1759 and William III married his second wife, Mary Wilkinson, just a day after the year of mourning ended, on April 17, 1760. = Henry Ludington II = Henry Ludington was the third child of William III and Mary (Knowles) Ludington. He was born at Branford, Connecticut, on May 25, 1739. He built his home and a grist mill around 1775 in the area known as the hamlet of Ludingtonville, named for his namesake; this later became the town of Kent, Putnam County, New York. He was made Colonel during the American Revolution and was aide-de-camp to George Washington. Huntington life-size statue of Sybil Ludington on horseback at Carmel, New York, is inscribed - \\"Sybil Ludington, Revolution War Heroine, April 26, 1777. Called out the volunteer militia by riding through the night alone on horseback at the age of 16 alerting the countryside to the burning of Danbury, Connecticut, by the British.\\" = Sybil Ludington = Sybil Ludington was the first child of Henry Ludington II and his wife Abigail Ludington. In 1777, at the age of 16, she rode a horse through the night to where the Continental Army had a supply depot. She warned approximately 400 militiamen under the direction of her father that British troops were planning to attack Danbury, Connecticut. Her trip was said to be similar to that of Paul Revere's ride. Sybil had been given praise from the towns she went through, as well as recognition from General George Washington for her service as a messenger. The American poet Berton Braley wrote a poem about Sybil's notable ride delivering the message. Sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington made a statue of Sybil Ludington depicting her ride, that is displayed at the Danbury Library grounds in Connecticut. Huntington also made a life-size statue depicting her ride that is at Lake Gleneida in Carmel, New York. There is a replica in Memorial Continental Hall of the National Society of the Daughter of the American Revolution in Washington, D.C. There is a commemorative stamp that was issued in 1975. The map shows seven roadside markers of the heroine's route that say, Sybil Ludington rode horseback over this road the night of April 26, 1777, to call out Colonial Ludington's regiment to repel the British at Danbury, Conn. = Frederick Ludington = Frederick, 1852 Frederick Ludington was the tenth child of Henry Ludington II (aka Colonial Ludington). He is associated with the development of the towns of Kent, New York, and Dover Plains, New York. Harrison Ludington and Nelson Ludington were sons of Frederick, and Colonel Ludington was their grandfather. Harrison is identified with the development of the city of Milwaukee and was its alderman for two terms and its mayor from 1872 to 1875. He served as Governor of Wisconsin from 1876 to 1878. Nelson was a pioneer of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and an early territorial developer. He established a sawmill and laid out the city of Escanaba, Michigan, in 1862. Nelson provided the name for the city. Escanaba street names were originally named after the wives and daughters of the partners of the Nelson Ludington Company. Frederick and Lewis built store about 1808 in Kent, New York. = Lewis Ludington = Lewis Ludington was the twelfth child and sixth son of Henry Ludington II. Lewis was the youngest of the children, born June 25, 1786. Lewis had bought some land in Columbia County, Wisconsin, about 1843. In July 1844 he designed a community layout for this land that was the founding of the city of Columbus, Wisconsin. = James Ludington = James Ludington, the sixth son of Lewis, was born at Carmel, New York, on April 18, 1827. He moved to Milwaukee in 1843 and lived there permanently. Around 1859 he developed a sawmill community in northwestern Michigan on the shores of Lake Michigan called Pere Marquette. This eventually was plotted into a village and grew. It was later renamed Ludington, Michigan, in his honor. Ludington never lived in the town that he founded. Many of the street names of Ludington, Michigan, are related to James in one way or another. The main downtown intersection is James Street and Ludington Ave.  Legacy  The caretaker of some of the family heirlooms as of 1975 is Mrs. Emily Ludington Jordan of Oak Park, Illinois. Her son Norman Kenneth Ludington has inherited the collection, which contains a cherry-wood bed, a card table, a fold-down desk, two chairs, and a wooden brass-topped cane.

Ferris debuted in publishing with her 2017 graphic novel My Favorite Thing Is Monsters. The novel tells a coming-of-age story of Karen Reyes, a girl growing in 1960s Chicago, and is written and drawn in the form of the character's notebook. The graphic novel was praised as a \\"masterpiece\\" and one of the best comics by a new author.  Life  Ferris was born to Eleanor Spiess-Ferris and Mike Ferris on Chicago's South Side and grew up on North Side's Uptown. Her parents are artists who met at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She worked as a freelance illustrator and toy designer for clients such as McDonald's and Takara Tomy before being an author. Ferris identified early in her life as a lesbian but later on came to see herself as bisexual. Ferris was sexually abused as a child, which she says negatively affected her ability to draw in a cartoon style for many years. In 2001, when she was 40, Ferris contracted West Nile fever from a mosquito bite. Three weeks after going to the hospital, she was paralyzed from the waist down and lost movement in her right hand. She eventually regained motor functionality and returned to working and drawing, receiving a MFA in creative writing from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Ferris discussing My Favorite Thing Is Monsters with Michael Cavna at Small Press Expo 2017 While recovering from the paralysis, Ferris worked on her graphic novel. My Favorite Thing Is Monsters tells the story of Karen Reyes, a 10-year-old girl and fan of monster movies (like Ferris herself) who, growing up amidst the social tensions of 1960s Chicago, investigates the death of her upstairs neighbor. The book is written and drawn in the form of Reyes' diary notebook, with crosshatched artwork drawn with a ballpoint pen. My Favorite Thing is Monsters was to be released in 2016, but the Chinese company shipping the books went bankrupt and the entire run was held at the Panama Canal.

The main utility of the theory from the physical point of view is a rigorous theoretical explanation of the ubiquitous spontaneous long-range dynamical behavior that manifests itself across disciplines via such phenomena as 1/f, flicker, and crackling noises and the power-law statistics, or Zipf's law, of instantonic processes like earthquakes and neuroavalanches. From the mathematical point of view, STS is interesting because it bridges the two major parts of mathematical physics ‚Äì the dynamical systems theory and topological field theories. Besides these and related disciplines such as algebraic topology and supersymmetric field theories, STS is also connected with the traditional theory of stochastic differential equations and the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators. The theory began with the application of BRST gauge fixing procedure to Langevin SDEs, that was later adapted to classical mechanics and its stochastic generalization, higher-order Langevin SDEs, and, more recently, to SDEs of arbitrary form, which allowed to link BRST formalism to the concept of transfer operators and recognize spontaneous breakdown of BRST supersymmetry as a stochastic generalization of dynamical chaos. The main idea of the theory is to study, instead of trajectories, the SDE-defined temporal evolution of differential forms. This evolution has an intrinsic BRST or topological supersymmetry representing the preservation of topology and/or the concept of proximity in the phase space by continuous time dynamics. The theory identifies a model as chaotic, in the generalized, stochastic sense, if its ground state is not supersymmetric, i.e., if the supersymmetry is broken spontaneously. Accordingly, the emergent long-range behavior that always accompanies dynamical chaos and its derivatives such as turbulence and self- organized criticality can be understood as a consequence of the Goldstone theorem.  History and relation to other theories  The first relation between supersymmetry and stochastic dynamics was established by Giorgio Parisi and Nicolas Sourlas who demonstrated that the application of the BRST gauge fixing procedure to Langevin SDEs, i.e., to SDEs with linear phase spaces, gradient flow vector fields, and additive noises, results in N=2 supersymmetric models. Since then, the so-emerged supersymmetry of Langevin SDEs has been studied rather extensively. Relations between this supersymmetry and a few physical concepts have been established including the fluctuation dissipation theorems, Jarzynski equality, Onsager principle of microscopic reversibility, solutions of Fokker-Planck equations, self-organization, etc. Similar approach was used to establish that classical mechanics, its stochastic generalization, and higher-order Langevin SDEs also have supersymmetric representations. Real dynamical systems, however, are never purely Langevin or classical mechanical. In addition, physically meaningful Langevin SDEs never break supersymmetry spontaneously. Therefore, for the purpose of the identification of the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking as dynamical chaos, the generalization of the Parisi-Sourlas approach to SDEs of general form is needed. This generalization could come only after a rigorous formulation of the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators because the stochastic evolution operator is pseudo-Hermitian in the general case. Such generalization showed that all SDEs possess N=1 BRST or topological supersymmetry (TS) and this finding completes the story of relation between supersymmetry and SDEs. In parallel to the BRST procedure approach to SDEs, mathematicians working in the dynamical systems theory introduced and studied the concept of generalized transfer operator defined for random dynamical systems. This concept underlies the most important object of the STS, the stochastic evolution operator, and provides it with a solid mathematical meaning. STS has a close relation with algebraic topology and its topological sector belongs to the class of models known as Witten-type topological or cohomological field theory. As a supersymmetric theory, BRST procedure approach to SDEs can be viewed as one of the realizations of the concept of Nicolai map.  Parisi‚ÄìSourlas approach to Langevin SDEs  In the context of supersymmetric approach to stochastic dynamics, the term Langevin SDEs denotes SDEs with Euclidean phase space, X = \\\\mathbb{R}^n , gradient flow vector field, and additive Gaussian white noise, \\\\dot x(t) = - \\\\partial U(x(t))+(2\\\\Theta)^{1/2} \\\\xi(t),where x\\\\in X , \\\\xi \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is the noise variable, \\\\Theta is the noise intensity, and \\\\partial U(x), which in coordinates (\\\\partial U(x))^i \\\\equiv \\\\delta^{ij}\\\\partial_jU(x) and \\\\partial_i U(x) \\\\equiv \\\\partial U(x)/\\\\partial x^i, is the gradient flow vector field with U(x) being the Langevin function often interpreted as the energy of the purely dissipative stochastic dynamical system. The Parisi-Sourlas method is a way of construction of the path integral representation of the Langevin SDE. It can be thought of as a BRST gauge fixing procedure that uses the Langevin SDE as a gauge condition. Namely, one considers the following functional integral, {\\\\mathcal W} = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\int \\\\dots \\\\int J \\\\left(\\\\prod olimits_\\\\tau \\\\delta(\\\\dot x(\\\\tau) - {\\\\mathcal F}(x(\\\\tau)))\\\\right)Dx \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{noise} , where \\\\mathcal F denotes the r.h.s. of the Langevin SDE, \\\\textstyle \\\\langle \\\\cdot \\\\rangle_\\\\text{noise} \\\\equiv \\\\int \\\\dots \\\\int \\\\cdot P(\\\\xi) D\\\\xi is the operation of stochastic averaging with P(\\\\xi) \\\\propto e^{- \\\\int_{t'}^t d\\\\tau \\\\xi^2(\\\\tau)/2} being the normalized distribution of noise configurations, \\\\textstyle J = \\\\operatorname{Det} \\\\frac{\\\\delta(\\\\dot x (\\\\tau) - {\\\\mathcal F} (x(\\\\tau)))}{\\\\delta x (\\\\tau')} is the Jacobian of the corresponding functional derivative, and the path integration is over all closed paths, x(t)=x(t') , where t' and t>t'are the initial and final moments of temporal evolution. = Topological interpretation = Topological aspects of the Parisi-Sourlas construction can be briefly outlined in the following manner. The delta- functional, i.e., the collection of the infinite number of delta-functions, ensures that only solutions of the Langevin SDE contribute to \\\\mathcal W. In the context of BRST procedure, these solutions can be viewed as Gribov copies. Each solution contributes either positive or negative unity: {\\\\mathcal W} = \\\\textstyle \\\\left\\\\langle I_N(\\\\xi)\\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\text{noise} with I_N(\\\\xi) = \\\\sum_\\\\text{solutions} \\\\operatorname{sign}J being the index of the so-called Nicolai map, \\\\xi = (\\\\dot x + \\\\partial U)/(2\\\\Theta)^{1/2} , which in this case is the map from the space of closed paths in X to the space of noise configurations, a map that provides a noise configuration at which a given closed path is a solution of the Langevin SDE. I_N(\\\\xi) can be viewed as a realization of Poincar√©‚ÄìHopf theorem on the infinite-dimensional space of close paths with the Langevin SDE playing the role of the vector field and with the solutions of Langevin SDE playing the role of the critical points with index \\\\operatorname{sign}J . I_N(\\\\xi) is independent of the noise configuration because it is of topological character. The same it true for its stochastic average, \\\\mathcal W, which is not the partition function of the model but, instead, its Witten index. = Path integral representation = With the help of a standard field theoretic technique that involves introduction of additional field called Lagrange multiplier, B, and a pair of fermionic fields called Faddeev‚ÄìPopov ghosts, \\\\chi, \\\\bar\\\\chi, the Witten index can be given the following form, {\\\\mathcal W} = \\\\int\\\\dots\\\\int_{p.b.c.} e^{(Q,\\\\Psi)}D\\\\Phi, where \\\\Phi denotes collection of all the fields, p.b.c. stands for periodic boundary conditions, the so-called gauge fermion, \\\\textstyle \\\\Psi = \\\\int_{t'}^td\\\\tau (\\\\imath_{\\\\dot x} - \\\\bar d)(\\\\tau), with \\\\textstyle \\\\imath_{\\\\dot x} = i \\\\bar\\\\chi_j\\\\dot x^j and \\\\textstyle \\\\bar d = - i \\\\bar\\\\chi_j\\\\delta^{jk}(\\\\partial_kU + \\\\Theta i B_k), and the BRST symmetry defined via its action on arbitrary functional A(\\\\Phi) as (Q, A(\\\\Phi)) = \\\\textstyle \\\\int _{t'}^td\\\\tau(\\\\chi^i(\\\\tau)\\\\delta/\\\\delta x^i(\\\\tau) + B_i(\\\\tau)\\\\delta/\\\\delta \\\\bar\\\\chi_i(\\\\tau)) A(\\\\Phi) . In the BRST formalism, the Q-exact pieces like, (Q,\\\\Psi), serve as gauge fixing tools. Therefore, the path integral expression for \\\\mathcal W can be interpreted as a model whose action contains nothing else but the gauge fixing term. This is a definitive feature of Witten-type topological field theories and in this particular case of BRST procedure approach to SDEs, the BRST symmetry can be also recognized as the topological supersymmetry. A common way to explain the BRST procedure is to say that the BRST symmetry generates the fermionic version of the gauge transformations, whereas its overall effect on the path integral is to limit the integration only to configurations that satisfy a specified gauge condition. This interpretation also applies to Parisi-Sourlas approach with the deformations of the trajectory and the Langevin SDE playing the roles of the gauge transformations and the gauge condition respectively. = Operator representation = Physical fermions in the high-energy physics and condensed matter models have antiperiodic boundary conditions in time. The unconventional periodic boundary conditions for fermions in the path integral expression for the Witten index is the origin of the topological character of this object. These boundary conditions reveal themselves in the operator representation of the Witten index as the alternating sign operator, {\\\\mathcal W} = \\\\operatorname{Tr}(-1)^{\\\\hat n} \\\\hat {\\\\mathcal M}_{tt'}, where \\\\hat n is the operator of the number of ghosts/fermions and the finite-time stochastic evolution operator (SEO), \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal M }_{tt'} = e^{- (t-t')\\\\hat H }, where, \\\\hat H = \\\\hat L_{-\\\\partial U} - \\\\Theta \\\\hat \\\\triangle= [\\\\hat d, \\\\hat{\\\\bar d}],is the infinitesimal SEO with \\\\textstyle \\\\hat{L} being the Lie derivative along the subscript vector field, \\\\hat \\\\triangle being the Laplacian, \\\\textstyle \\\\hat{d} = \\\\chi^i \\\\partial/\\\\partial x^i being the exterior derivative, which is the operator representative of the TS, and \\\\textstyle \\\\hat{\\\\bar d} = - (i\\\\hat{\\\\bar\\\\chi}_i) \\\\delta^{ij} ( \\\\partial_jU + \\\\Theta (i\\\\hat B_j)) , where i {\\\\hat B}_j = \\\\partial/ \\\\partial x^j and i{\\\\hat{\\\\bar \\\\chi}}_j = \\\\partial/ \\\\partial \\\\chi^j are bosonic and fermionic momenta, and with square brackets denoting bi-graded commutator, i.e., it is an anticommutator if both operators are fermionic (contain odd total number of \\\\chi 's and \\\\hat {\\\\bar \\\\chi} 's) and a commutator otherwise. The exterior derivative and \\\\textstyle \\\\hat{\\\\bar d} are supercharges. They are nilpotent, e.g., \\\\hat d^2=0, and commutative with the SEO. In other words, Langevin SDEs possess N=2 supersymmetry. The fact that \\\\textstyle \\\\hat{\\\\bar d} is a supercharge is accidental. For SDEs of arbitrary form, this is not true. = Hilbert space = The wavefunctions are functions not only of the bosonic variables, x\\\\in X, but also of the Grassmann numbers or fermions, \\\\chi\\\\in TX, from the tangent space of X. The wavefunctions can be viewed as differential forms on X with the fermions playing the role of the differentials \\\\chi\\\\equiv dx\\\\wedge. The concept of infinitesimal SEO generalizes the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck operator, which is essentially the SEO acting on top differential forms that have the meaning of the total probability distributions. Differential forms of lesser degree can be interpreted, at least locally on X, as conditional probability distributions. Viewing the spaces of differential forms of all degrees as wavefunctions of the model is a mathematical necessity. Without it, the Witten index representing the most fundamental object of the model‚Äîthe partition function of the noise‚Äîwould not exist and the dynamical partition function would not represent the number of fixed points of the SDE (see below). The most general understanding of the wavefunctions is the coordinate- free objects that contain information not only on trajectories but also on the evolution of the differentials and/or Lyapunov exponents.  Relation to nonlinear sigma model and algebraic topology  In Ref., a model has been introduced that can be viewed as a 1D prototype of the topological nonlinear sigma models (TNSM), a subclass of the Witten-type topological field theories. The 1D TNSM is defined for Riemannian phase spaces while for Euclidean phase spaces it reduces to the Parisi-Sourlas model. Its key difference from STS is the diffusion operator which is the Hodge Laplacian for 1D TNSM and \\\\textstyle \\\\hat L_{e_a} \\\\hat L_{e_a} for STS . This difference is unimportant in the context of relation between STS and algebraic topology, the relation established by the theory of 1D TNSM (see, e.g., Refs.). The model is defined by the following evolution operator \\\\hat H = \\\\hat L_{-\\\\partial U} + \\\\Theta[\\\\hat d, \\\\hat{d}^\\\\dagger], where (\\\\partial U)^i = g^{ij}\\\\partial_j U with g being the metric, [\\\\hat d, \\\\hat{d}^\\\\dagger] is the Hodge Laplacian, and the differential forms from the exterior algebra of the phase space, \\\\Omega(X), are viewed as wavefunctions. There exists a similarity transformation, \\\\hat H \\\\to {\\\\hat H}_U = e^{U/2\\\\Theta} \\\\hat H e^{- U/2\\\\Theta} , that brings the evolution operator to the explicitly Hermitian form {\\\\hat H}_U = \\\\Theta [\\\\hat d_U, \\\\hat d_U^\\\\dagger] with \\\\hat d_U = e^{U/2\\\\Theta} \\\\hat d e^{-U/2\\\\Theta} = \\\\chi^i(\\\\partial/\\\\partial x^i - \\\\partial_i U /2\\\\Theta) . In the Euclidean case, {\\\\hat H}_U is the Hamiltonian of a N=2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics. One can introduce two Hermitian operators, \\\\hat q_1 = (\\\\hat d_U + \\\\hat d_U^\\\\dagger) /2^{1/2} and \\\\hat q_2 = i (\\\\hat d_U - \\\\hat d_U^\\\\dagger) /2^{1/2} , such that {\\\\hat H}_U = \\\\Theta \\\\hat q_1^2 = \\\\Theta \\\\hat q_2^2 . This demonstrates that the spectrum of {\\\\hat H}_U and/or {\\\\hat H} is real and nonnegative. This is also true for SEOs of Langevin SDEs. For the SDEs of arbitrary form, however, this is no longer true as the eigenvalues of the SEO can be negative and even complex, which actually allows for the TS to be broken spontanenously. The following properties of the evolution operator of 1D TNSM hold even for the SEO of the SDEs of arbitrary form. The evolution operator commutes with the operator of the degree of differential forms. As a result, \\\\textstyle \\\\hat H = \\\\hat H^{(\\\\dim X)} \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus \\\\hat H^{(0)} , where \\\\textstyle \\\\hat H^{(k)} = \\\\hat H _{\\\\Omega^{(k)}} and \\\\Omega^{(n)}(X) is the space of differential forms of degree n . Furthermore, due to the presence of TS, \\\\Omega(X)={\\\\mathcal H} \\\\oplus {\\\\mathcal N} \\\\oplus (\\\\hat d {\\\\mathcal N}), where {\\\\mathcal H} are the supersymmetric eigenstates, \\\\theta's, non-trivial in de Rham cohomology whereas the rest are the pairs of non-supersymmetric eigenstates of the form \\\\vartheta\\\\rangle and \\\\hat d \\\\vartheta\\\\rangle . All supersymmetric eigenstates have exactly zero eigenvalue and, barring accidental situations, all non-supersymmetric states have non-zero eigenvalues. Non-supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates do not contribute to the Witten index, which equals the difference in the numbers of the supersymmetric states of even and odd degrees, {\\\\mathcal W} = \\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{even }\\\\theta's\\\\\\\\} - \\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{odd }\\\\theta's\\\\\\\\}. For compact X , each de Rham cohomology class provides one supersymmetric eigenstate and the Witten index equals the Euler characteristic of the phase space.  BRST procedure for SDEs of arbitrary form  The Parisi-Sourlas method of BRST procedure approach to Langevin SDEs have also been adapted to classical mechanics, stochastic generalization of classical mechanics, higher order Langevin SDEs, and, more recently, to SDEs of arbitrary form. While there exist standard techniques that allow to consider models with colored noises, higher-dimensional \\"base spaces\\" described by partial SDEs etc., the key elements of STS can be discussed using the following basic class of SDEs, \\\\dot x(t) = F(x(t))+(2\\\\Theta)^{1/2}e_a(x(t))\\\\xi^a(t),where x\\\\in X is a point in the phase space assumed for simplicity a closed topological manifold, F(x)\\\\in TX_x is a sufficiently smooth vector field, called flow vector field, from the tangent space of X, and e_a \\\\in TX, a=1, \\\\ldots, \\\\dim X is a set of sufficiently smooth vector fields that specify how the system is coupled to the noise, which is called additive/multiplicative depending on whether e_a 's are independent/dependent on the position on X. = Ambiguity of path integral representation and Ito‚ÄìStratonovich dilemma = BRST gauge fixing procedure goes along the same lines as in case of Langevin SDEs. The topological interpretation of the BRST procedure is just the same and the path integral representation of the Witten index is defined by the gauge fermion, \\\\textstyle \\\\Psi, given by the same expression but with the generalized version of \\\\textstyle \\\\bar d = \\\\imath_{F} - \\\\Theta \\\\imath_{e_a} (Q,\\\\imath_{e_a}). There is one important subtlety, however, that appears on the way to the operator representation of the model. Unlike for Langevin SDEs, classical mechanics, and other SDEs with additive noises, the path integral representation of the finite-time SEO is an ambiguous object. This ambiguity originates from non- commutativity of momenta and position operators, e.g., \\\\hat B \\\\hat x e \\\\hat x \\\\hat B . As a result, B(\\\\tau) x(\\\\tau) in the path integral representation has a whole one-parameter family of possible interpretations in the operator representation, (\\\\alpha \\\\hat B \\\\hat x + (1-\\\\alpha)\\\\hat x \\\\hat B)\\\\psi(\\\\tau)\\\\rangle , where \\\\psi(\\\\tau)\\\\rangle denotes an arbitrary wavefunction. Accordingly, there is a whole \\\\alpha-family of infinitesimal SEOs, \\\\hat H_\\\\alpha = \\\\hat L_F - \\\\Theta\\\\hat L_{e_a} \\\\hat L_{e_a}= [\\\\hat d, \\\\hat{\\\\bar d}_\\\\alpha],with \\\\textstyle \\\\hat{\\\\bar d}_\\\\alpha = \\\\hat{\\\\imath}_{F_\\\\alpha} - \\\\Theta \\\\hat{\\\\imath}_{e_a}\\\\hat L_{e_a} , \\\\hat{\\\\imath}_{F_\\\\alpha} being the interior multiplication by the subscript vector field, and the \\"shifted\\" flow vector field being \\\\textstyle F_\\\\alpha = F - \\\\Theta(2\\\\alpha-1)(e_a\\\\cdot\\\\partial) e_a . Noteworthy, unlike in Langevin SDEs, \\\\hat {\\\\bar d}_\\\\alpha is not a supercharge and STS cannot be identified as a N=2 supersymmetric theory in the general case. The path integral representation of stochastic dynamics is equivalent to the traditional understanding of SDEs as of a continuous time limit of stochastic difference equations where different choices of parameter \\\\alpha are called \\"interpretations\\" of SDEs. The choice \\\\alpha=1/2 , for which \\\\textstyle F_{1/2} = F and which is known in quantum theory as Weyl symmetrization rule, is known as the Stratonovich interpretation, whereas \\\\alpha=1 as the Ito interpretation. While in quantum theory the Weyl symmetrization is preferred because it guaranties hermiticity of Hamiltonians, in STS the Weyl- Stratonovich approach is preferred because it corresponds to the most natural mathematical meaning of the finite-time SEO discussed below‚Äîthe stochastically averaged pullback induced by the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms. = Eigensystem of stochastic evolution operator = The three possible types of SEO spectra on a 3D sphere. Each line of triples of graphs represents spec {\\\\hat H}^{(n)}, n=0,...3. for the three types of spectra. Black dots at the origin for the first and the last lines represent supersymmetric eigenstates from the zeroth and the third cohomologies of the 3 sphere. For types b and c, the (fastest growing) ground (eigen)states are non-supersymmetric because they have non- zero eigenvalues. TS is broken spontaneously. Vertical arrowed lines visualize supersymmetry operator. As compared to the SEO of Langevin SDEs, the SEO of a general form SDE is pseudo-Hermitian. As a result, the eigenvalues of non- supersymmetric eigenstates are not restricted to be real positive, whereas the eigenvalues of supersymmetric eigenstates are still exactly zero. Just like for Langevin SDEs and nonlinear sigma model, the structure of the eigensystem of the SEO reestablishes the topological character of the Witten index: the contributions from the non-supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates vanish and only supersymmetric states contribute the Euler characteristic of (closed) X. Among other properties of the SEO spectra is that \\\\textstyle \\\\hat H^{(\\\\operatorname{dim} X)} and \\\\textstyle \\\\hat H^{(0)} never break TS, i.e., \\\\textstyle Re (\\\\operatorname{spec} \\\\hat H^{(\\\\operatorname{dim} X)}) \\\\ge 0 . As a result, there are three major types of the SEO spectra presented in the figure on the right. The two types that have negative (real parts of) eigenvalues correspond to the spontaneously broken TS. All types of the SEO spectra are realizable as can be established, e.g., from the exact relation between the theory of kinematic dynamo and STS.  STS without BRST procedure  = The mathematical meaning of stochastic evolution operator = The finite-time SEO can be obtained in another, more mathematical way based on the idea to study the SDE-induced actions on differential forms directly, without going through the BRST gauge fixing procedure. The so-obtained finite-time SEO is known in dynamical systems theory as the generalized transfer operator and it has also been used in the classical theory of SDEs (see, e.g., Refs. ). The contribution to this construction from STS is the exposition of the supersymmetric structure underlying it and establishing its relation to the BRST procedure for SDEs. Namely, for any configuration of the noise, \\\\xi, and an initial condition, x(t')=x'\\\\in X, SDE defines a unique solution/trajectory, x(t)\\\\in X. Even for noise configurations that are non-differentiable with respect to time, t, the solution is differentiable with respect to the initial condition, x'. In other words, SDE defines the family of the noise- configuration-dependent diffeomorphisms of the phase space to itself, M_{tt'}:X\\\\to X. This object can be understood as a collection and/or definition of all the noise-configuration-dependent trajectories, x(t) = M_{tt'}(x'). The diffeomorphisms induce actions or pullbacks, \\\\textstyle M^*_{t't}:\\\\Omega(X)\\\\to\\\\Omega(X) . Unlike, say, trajectories in X, pullbacks are linear objects even for nonlinear X. Linear objects can be averaged and averaging M^*_{t't} over the noise configurations, \\\\xi, results in the finite-time SEO which is unique and corresponds to the Weyl-Stratonovich interpretation of the BRST procedure approach to SDEs, \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal M }_{tt'} = \\\\langle M^*_{t't} \\\\rangle_\\\\text{noise}=e^{-(t-t')\\\\hat H_{1/2}}. Within this definition of the finite-time SEO, the Witten index can be recognized as the sharp trace of the generalized transfer operator. It also links the Witten index to the Lefschetz index, \\\\textstyle I_L=\\\\operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\\\\hat n} M_{t't}^*= \\\\sum_{x\\\\in \\\\operatorname{fix} M_{tt'}} \\\\operatorname{sign} \\\\operatorname{det} (\\\\delta_j^i -\\\\partial M_{tt'}^i(x) /\\\\partial x^j) , a topological constant that equals the Euler characteristic of the (closed) phase space. Namely, \\\\textstyle {\\\\mathcal W} = \\\\operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\\\\hat n} \\\\langle M_{t't}^* \\\\rangle_\\\\text{noise} = \\\\langle \\\\operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\\\\hat n} M_{t't}^* \\\\rangle_\\\\text{noise} = I_{L} . = The meaning of supersymmetry and the butterfly effect = The N=2 supersymmetry of Langevin SDEs has been linked to the Onsager principle of microscopic reversibility and Jarzynski equality. In classical mechanics, a relation between the corresponding N=2 supersymmetry and ergodicity has been proposed. In general form SDEs, where physical arguments may not be applicable, a lower level explanation of the TS is available. This explanation is based on understanding of the finite-time SEO as a stochastically averaged pullback of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms (see subsection above). In this picture, the question of why any SDE has TS is the same as the question of why exterior derivative commutes with the pullback of any diffeomorphism. The answer to this question is differentiability of the corresponding map. In other words, the presence of TS is the algebraic version of the statement that continuous-time flow preserves continuity of X. Two initially close points will remain close during evolution, which is just yet another way of saying that M_{tt'} is a diffeomorphism. In deterministic chaotic models, initially close points can part in the limit of infinitely long temporal evolution. This is the famous butterfly effect, which is equivalent to the statement that M_{tt'} losses differentiability in this limit. In algebraic representation of dynamics, the evolution in the infinitely long time limit is described by the ground state of the SEO and the butterfly effect is equivalent to the spontaneous breakdown of TS, i.e., to the situation when the ground state is not supersymmetric. Noteworthy, unlike traditional understanding of deterministic chaotic dynamics, the spontaneous breakdown of TS works also for stochastic cases. This is the most important generalization because deterministic dynamics is, in fact, a mathematical idealization. Real dynamical systems cannot be isolated from their environments and thus always experience stochastic influence.  Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and dynamical chaos  BRST gauge fixing procedure applied to SDEs leads directly to the Witten index. The Witten index is of topological character and it does not respond to any perturbation. In particular, all response correlators calculated using the Witten index vanish. This fact has a physical interpretation within the STS: the physical meaning of the Witten index is the partition function of the noise and since there is no backaction from the dynamical system to the noise, the Witten index has no information on the details of the SDE. In contrast, the information on the details of the model is contained in the other trace-like object of the theory, the dynamical partition function, {\\\\mathcal Z}_{tt'} = \\\\int\\\\dots\\\\int_{a.p.b.c.} e^{(Q,\\\\Psi)}D\\\\Phi = \\\\operatorname{Tr} \\\\hat {\\\\mathcal M}_{tt'},where a.p.b.c. denotes antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermionic fields and periodic boundary conditions for bosonic fields. In the standard manner, the dynamical partition function can be promoted to the generating functional by coupling the model to external probing fields. For a wide class of models, dynamical partition function provides lower bound for the stochastically averaged number of fixed points of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms, \\\\left.{\\\\mathcal Z}_{tt'}\\\\right_{t-t'\\\\to\\\\infty} = \\\\sum olimits_{p} e^{-(t-t'){\\\\mathsf E}_p} \\\\le \\\\langle \\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{fixed points of } M_{t't}\\\\\\\\} \\\\rangle_\\\\text{noise} \\\\propto e^{(t-t')S} .Here, index p runs over \\"physical states\\", i.e., the eigenstates that grow fastest with the rate of the exponential growth given as, \\\\Gamma_g = - \\\\min_\\\\alpha \\\\operatorname{Re} {\\\\mathsf E}_\\\\alpha \\\\ge 0 , and parameter S can be viewed as stochastic version of dynamical entropy such as topological entropy. Positive entropy is one of the key signatures of deterministic chaos. Therefore, the situation with positive \\\\Gamma_g must be identified as chaotic in the generalized, stochastic sense as it implies positive entropy: 0 < \\\\Gamma_g \\\\le S . At the same time, positive \\\\Gamma_g implies that TS is broken spontaneously, that is, the ground state in not supersymmetric because its eigenvalue is not zero. In other words, positive dynamical entropy is a reason to identify spontaneous TS breaking as the stochastic generalization of the concept of dynamical chaos. Noteworthy, Langevin SDEs are never chaotic because the spectrum of their SEO is real non- negative. The complete list of reasons why spontaneous TS breaking must be viewed as the stochastic generalization of the concept of dynamical chaos is as follows. * Positive dynamical entropy. * According to the Goldstone's theorem, spontaneous TS breaking must tailor a long-range dynamical behavior, one of the manifestations of which is the butterfly effect discussed above in the context of the meaning of TS. * From the properties of the eigensystem of SEO, TS can be spontaneously broken only if \\\\dim X \\\\ge 3 . This conclusion can be viewed as the stochastic generalization of the Poincare‚ÄìBendixson theorem for deterministic chaos. * In the deterministic case, integrable models in the sense of dynamical systems have well-defined global stable and unstable manifolds of F . The bras/kets of the global ground states of such models are the Poincare duals of the global stable/unstable manifolds. These ground states are supersymmetric so that TS is not broken spontaneously. On the contrary, when the model is non-integrable or chaotic, its global (un)stable manifolds are not well-defined topological manifolds, but rather have a fractal, self-recurrent structure that can be captured using the concept of branching manifolds. Wavefunctions that can represent such manifolds cannot be supersymmetric. Therefore, TS breaking is intrinsically related to the concept of non-integrability in the sense of dynamical systems, which is actually yet another widely accepted definition of deterministic chaos. All the above features of TS breaking work for both deterministic and stochastic models. This is in contrast with the traditional deterministic chaos whose trajectory-based properties such as the topological mixing cannot in principle be generalized to stochastic case because, just like in quantum dynamics, all trajectories are possible in the presence of noise and, say, the topological mixing property is satisfied trivially by all models with non-zero noise intensity.  STS as a topological field theory  alt=Instantoic matrix elemtent as an intersention numberThe topological sector of STS can be recognized as a member of the Witten-type topological field theories. In other words, some objects in STS are of topological character with the Witten index being the most famous example. There are other classes of topological objects. One class of objects is related to instantons, i.e., transient dynamics. Crumpling paper, protein folding, and many other nonlinear dynamical processes in response to quenches, i.e., to external (sudden) changes of parameters, can be recognized as instantonic dynamics. From the mathematical point of view, instantons are families of solutions of deterministic equations of motion, \\\\dot x = F , that lead from, say, less stable fixed point of F to a more stable fixed point. Certain matrix elements calculated on instantons are of topological nature. An example of such matrix elements can be defined for a pair of critical points, a and b , with a being more stable than b, \\\\left.\\\\int\\\\dots\\\\int_{x(\\\\pm\\\\infty)=a,b} \\\\left(\\\\prod olimits_i O_i(t_i)\\\\right)e^{({\\\\mathcal Q},\\\\Psi)} D\\\\Phi \\\\right_{\\\\Theta\\\\to0} = \\\\langle a  {\\\\mathcal T}\\\\left(\\\\prod olimits_i \\\\hat O_i(t_i)\\\\right)  b \\\\rangle. Here \\\\langle a  and  b \\\\rangle are the bra and ket of the corresponding perturbative supersymmetric ground states, or vacua, which are the Poincare duals of the local stable and unstable manifolds of the corresponding critical point; {\\\\mathcal T} denotes chronological ordering; O 's are observables that are the Poincare duals of some closed submanifolds in X ; \\\\hat O(t) = \\\\hat {\\\\mathcal M}_{t_0, t} \\\\hat O \\\\hat {\\\\mathcal M}_{t, t_0} are the observables in the Heisenberg representation with t_0 being an unimportant reference time moment. The critical points have different indexes of stability so that the states a\\\\rangle and b\\\\rangle are topologically inequivalent as they represent unstable manifolds of different dimensionalities. The above matrix elements are independent of t_i's as they actually represent the intersection number of O-manifolds on the instanton as exemplified in the figure. The above instantonic matrix elements are exact only in the deterministic limit. In the general stochastic case, one can consider global supersymmetric states, \\\\theta's, from the De Rham cohomology classes of X and observables, \\\\gamma , that are Poincare duals of closed manifolds non-trivial in homology of X. The following matrix elements, \\\\textstyle \\\\langle \\\\theta_\\\\alpha  {\\\\mathcal T}\\\\left(\\\\prod olimits_i \\\\hat \\\\gamma_i(t_i)\\\\right)  \\\\theta_\\\\beta \\\\rangle, are topological invariants representative of the structure of De Rham cohomology ring of X .  Applications  Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics can be interesting in different ways. For example, STS offers a promising realization of the concept of supersymmetry. In general, there are two major problems in the context of supersymmetry. The first is establishing connections between this mathematical entity and the real world. Within STS, supersymmetry is the most common symmetry in nature because it is pertinent to all continuous time dynamical systems. The second is the spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry. This problem is particularly important for particle physics because supersymmetry of elementary particles, if exists at extremely short scale, must be broken spontaneously at large scale. This problem is nontrivial because supersymmetries are hard to break spontaneously, the very reason behind the introduction of soft or explicit supersymmetry breaking. Within STS, spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry is indeed a nontrivial dynamical phenomenon that has been variously known across disciplines as chaos, turbulence, self-organized criticality etc. A few more specific applications of STS are as follows. = Classification of stochastic dynamics = Stochastic dynamical systems can be classified according to whether TS is spontaneously broken or not (ordered/symmetric) and whether the flow vector field is integrable or non-integrable (sometimes chaotic). Symmetric phase can be identified as thermal equilibrium (T). Ordered non- integrable phase can be called chaos (C) because it hosts conventional deterministic chaos. Ordered integrable phase can be called noise-induced chaos (N) because TS breaking involves anti-instantons that disappear in the deterministic limit. The N-phase is also known in the literature as self- organized criticality. STS provides classification for stochastic models depending on whether TS is broken and integrability of flow vector field. In can be exemplified as a part of the general phase diagram at the border of chaos (see figure on the right). The phase diagram has the following properties: * For physical models, TS gets restored eventually with the increase of noise intensity. * Symmetric phase can be called thermal equilibrium or T-phase because the ground state is the supersymmetric state of steady-state total probability distribution. * In the deterministic limit, ordered phase is equivalent to deterministic chaotic dynamics with non- integrable flow. * Ordered non-integrable phase can be called chaos or C-phase because ordinary deterministic chaos belongs to it. * Ordered integrable phase can be called noise-induced chaos or N-phase because it disappears in the deterministic limit. TS is broken by the condensation of (anti-)instantons (see below). * At stronger noises, the sharp N-C boundary must smear out into a crossover because (anti-)instantons lose their individuality and it is hard for an external observer to tell one tunneling process from another. = Demystification of self-organized criticality = Many sudden (or instantonic) processes in nature, such as, e.g., crackling noise, exhibit scale-free statistics often called the Zipf's law. As an explanation for this peculiar spontaneous dynamical behavior, it was proposed to believe that some stochastic dynamical systems have a tendency to self-tune themselves into a critical point, the phenomenological approach known as self-organized criticality (SOC). STS offers an alternative perspective on this phenomenon. Within STS, SOC is nothing more than dynamics in the N-phase. Specifically, the definitive feature of the N-phase is the peculiar mechanism of the TS breaking. Unlike in the C-phase, where the TS is broken by the non- integrability of the flow, in the N-phase, the TS is spontaneously broken due to the condensation of the configurations of instantons and noise-induced antiinstantons, i.e., time-reversed instantons. These processes can be roughly interpreted as the noise-induced tunneling events between, e.g., different attractors. Qualitatively, the dynamics in the N-phase appears to an external observer as a sequence of sudden jumps or \\"avalanches\\" that must exhibit a scale-free behavior/statistics as a result of the Goldstone theorem. This picture of dynamics in the N-phase is exactly the dynamical behavior that the concept of SOC was designed to explain. In contrast with the original understanding of SOC, its STS interpretation has little to do with the traditional critical phenomena theory where scale-free behavior is associated with unstable fixed points of the renormalization group flow. = Kinematic dynamo theory = Magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon of kinematic dynamo can also be identified as the spontaneous breakdown of TS. This result follows from equivalence between the evolution operator of the magnetic field and the SEO of the corresponding SDE describing the flow of the background matter. The so emerged STS-kinematic dynamo correspondence proves, in particular, that both types of TS breaking spectra are possible, with the real and complex ground state eigenvalues, because kinematic dynamo with both types of the fastest growing eigenmodes are known. = Transient dynamics = It is well known that various types of transient dynamics, such as quenches, exhibit spontaneous long-range behavior. In case of quenches across phase transitions, this behavior is often attributed to the proximity of criticality. Quenches that do not exhibit a phase transition are also known to exhibit long-range characteristics, with the best known examples being the Barkhausen effect and the various realizations of the concept of crackling noise. It is intuitively appealing that theoretical explanations for the scale-free behavior in quenches must be the same for all quenches, regardless of whether or not it produces a phase transition; STS offers such an explanation. Namely, transient dynamics is essentially a composite instanton and TS is intrinsically broken within instantons. Even though TS breaking within instantons is not exactly due to the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry by a global ground state, this effective TS breaking must also result in a scale-free behavior. This understanding is supported by the fact that condensed instantons lead to appearance of logarithms in the correlation functions. This picture of transient dynamics explains computational efficiency of the digital memcomputing machines. = Low energy effective theories for dynamical chaos = In physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking is known as \\"ordering\\". For example, the spontaneous breakdown of translational symmetry in a liquid is the mathematical essence of crystallization or spatial \\"ordering\\" of molecules into a lattice. Therefore, spontaneous TS breaking picture of chaotic dynamics is in a certain sense opposite to the semantics of word \\"chaos\\". Due to its temporal character, it is actually Chronos, not Chaos, that appears to be the primordial Greek deity closest in its spirit to the TS breaking order. Perhaps, a more accurate identifier than \\"chaos\\" should be coined for TS breaking in the future. As of this moment, this qualitatively new understanding of dynamical chaos already points into a research direction that may lead to resolutions of some important problems such as turbulence and neurodynamics. Namely, as in case of any other \\"ordering\\", a simplified yet accurate description of chaotic dynamics can be achieved in terms of the low- energy effective theory for an order parameter. While the low-energy effective description of chaotic dynamics may be very case specific, its order parameter must always be a representative of the gapless fermions or goldstinos of the spontaneously broken TS.

The plant entered commercial service in 1977, and the new carbon emissions reduction system was first put into operation on January 10, 2017. The project is designed to annually capture approximately 33% of the carbon dioxide () (or 1.6 million tonnes) emissions from the plant's boiler #8.Today in energy US Energy Information Administration.

The carbon dioxide gas is captured at 99% purity, and is then compressed and piped about 82 miles to the West Ranch Oil Field, where it is used for enhanced oil recovery. The oil field had previously been producing 300 barrels of oil per day. With the new injection of high pressure carbon dioxide into the field, the oil production of the field was increased by a factor of 50 to 15,000 barrels per day. This project is expected to run for at least another 20 years. To satisfy the Clean Coal Power Initiative requirements, the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology has put a monitoring plan in place to keep track of the injection and movement of the beneath the surface and in the rock structures at West Ranch. On May 1, 2020, NRG shut down Petra Nova, citing low oil prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plant had also reportedly suffered frequent outages and missed its carbon sequestration goal by 17% over its first three years of operation.

The leaving the carbon capture plant is over 99% pure and is sent 82 miles through 12-inch diameter pipes to their end location of the West Ranch oil field, where it is used for enhanced oil recovery. The carbon dioxide from the Petra Nova Initiative will eventually end up in sandstone in the Frio Formation of the West Ranch oil field. It will remain about 5,000 feet underground and cover more than 4,000 acres of ground area.  Economics  The Petra Nova carbon emissions reduction system costed approximately $1 billion to install, and received a nearly $190 million grant from the U.S. Government under the Clean Coal Initiative, as well as a $250 million loan from the Japanese government. The increased oil recovery in the adjacent oil field was expected to result in a net savings. However, when the project was first proposed oil prices were very high (at $100 per barrel) and it was assumed that they would not drop. As of 2017, the current oil price is about $50 per barrel and therefore a net loss has resulted regarding the oil production at the field. On May 1, 2020, NRG shut down Petra Nova, citing the low cost of oil as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Gorgon Project, located on Barrow Island in Western Australia, includes a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, a domestic gas plant, and a Carbon Dioxide Injection Project. The initial carbon dioxide injections are planned to take place by the end of 2017. Once launched, the Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project will be the world's largest CO2 injection plant, with an ability to store up to 4 million tons of CO2 per year ‚Äì approximately 120 million tons over the project‚Äôs lifetime, and 40 percent of total Gorgon Project emissions.  Technology  Gas is supplied from two world-class gas fields namely, Gorgon field that contains on average 14% of naturally occurring reservoir CO2, and Jansz-lo field that contains less than 1% CO2. Reservoir CO2 is extracted from natural gas as a part of normal gas-processing operations. During the liquefaction process, natural gas is cooled to -162 ¬∞C. CO2 freezes above this temperature, so it needs to be separated from the natural gas stream prior to gas processing and liquefaction. Separation is performed using a basic absorber and stripper system and an amine-based solvent. The Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project will compress and pipe separated CO2 to nine injection wells where it will be subsequently injected into the Dupuy Formation. Once the is injected, it will migrate through the Dupuy Formation until it remains trapped. The top of the Dupuy Formation reservoir is located approximately 2300 m below Barrow Island and is overlain by a thick shale cap-rock seal. The pressure in the reservoir will cause the injected CO2 to behave as a supercritical fluid with behavior of both a liquid and a gas. The reservoir CO2 will become trapped in the reservoir through a combination of residual saturation trapping and by dissolution into the waters in the formation.  Environmental impacts  The carbon dioxide injection plant is located on Barrow Island, a Class A nature reserve. Therefore, the development of the processing plant had to undergo very strict environmental regulations. The Joint Venture established expert panels to protect the biodiversity of the island and surrounding marine environment. To ensure that the Dupuy Formation was suitable for underground injection of reservoir carbon dioxide, the Gorgon Joint Venture undertook additional drilling, well tests, and seismic surveys prior to making the final investment decision. An ongoing monitoring program, including observation wells and seismic surveys, will assist in managing the performance of the injected carbon dioxide in the Dupuy Formation.

The proposed 426 MW plant was expected to send 2 Mt CO2/year to an offshore saline aquifer, achieving 90% capture. Due to the cancellation of key subsidies and withdrawal of major commercial investments, the White Rose Carbon Capture and Storage project appears to have stalled, with no new updates on the project since 2016.  History  During the early 2010s, there was interest in the White Rose project taking part of the new governmental subsidies, most especially the CCS Commercialisation Programme and the EU New Entrant Reserve (NER) 300, both of which aimed at funding low-carbon energy projects to scale commercially. In 2014, the CCS Commercialisation Programme awarded the White Rose project with a 2-year Front End Engineering Design (FEED) Programme contract, which would finalize the engineering and financials of the project Also at this time, the White Rose project also received EUR 300 million from the European Commission. However, in November 2015, six months before the funding was supposed to be received, the UK government announced the end of the CCS commercialization Programme due to the UK Treasury‚Äôs concerns of high consumer costs and taxpayer money funding CCS before it reached its cost-efficiency. The Treasury cites the fact that no examples of the technology working after attempting to fund the idea in 2011 and in 2012.

It targets two main markets: networking and storage infrastructure in data centers; and high- performance embedded computing for critical applications. Kalray was created in 2008 as a spin-off from the CEA. It is headquartered in Grenoble (France), has about 70 employees (50 of which in engineering and R&D;) and has 3 other office locations: Sophia Antipolis (France), Los Altos, California (USA) and Tokyo (Japan). Its customers are system integrators and equipment manufacturers for data centers, automotive, defense and aerospace.  Product  = MPPA manycore processors = MPPA¬Æ manycore processors are composed of clusters of 16 VLIW cores each. A high-speed network on chip is used to interconnect clusters. The MPPA core implements a 5-issue VLIW architecture that provides strong timing predictability properties while delivering scalar performances competitive with high-end superscalar application processors. MPPA processors can be programmed using a Software Development Kit that encompasses the GNU toolchain, supporting standard programming environment for C and C++ with OpenMP, OpenCL. Neural network inference applications are supported by a fully automatic code generator called KaNN that takes trained neural networks described in Caffe or TensorFlow and produces optimized C code for low-latency inference.  MPPA-256 Andey  Produced in 2013 in CMOS 28HP technology from TSMC, this processor running at 400 MHz has been designed as a target for a cyclostatic dataflow language called Sigma-C.  MPPA2-256 Bostan  Produced in 2015 with the same CMOS 28HP technology from TSMC, this processor running at 550 MHz was enhanced to increase the floating-point performance of the VLIW cores, to natively support the Linux operating system, and to process high-speed Ethernet (up to 80Gbit/s). Each VLIW core was extended with a tightly coupled cryptographic coprocessor for security protocol acceleration.  MPPA2.2-256 Bostan2  Produced in 2017, this processor is based on the previous generation, Bostan, with an improved DDR controller, Ethernet controller and PCIe controller. As a result, this processor fully supports the NVM Express¬Æ (NVMe‚Ñ¢) standard interface (for connecting hosts to PCIe bus-attached SSDs), and also the NVMe over Fabrics standard using RDMA (for connections between servers, storage controllers, and NVMe enclosures).  MPPA3 Coolidge  The 3rd-generation MPPA processor Coolidge has been released. Based on TSMC 16nm FinFET process technology, this processor includes 80 64-bit VLIW processing cores distributed among 5 clusters, 8x 25Gbit/s Ethernet and 16x PCIe Gen4 interfaces. Each VLIW core is extended with a tightly coupled tensor co-processor for deep learning application acceleration.  Product history  The first Kalray patent was filed in 2010. Today the company holds 23 patent families, including 2 families with an exclusive CEA license. On 22 June 2015, Kalray began the distribution of data center acceleration board families: TurboCard and KONIC, for networking and storage applications, both of which can be programmed with either standard C or C++. TurboCard and KONIC both utilize the MPPA2-256 Bostan 2nd generation processor. In 2018, the Kalray solutions were certified by the NVM Express organization through the University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL), an independent testing provider of standard conformance solutions and multi-vendor interoperability. This certification was the first of its kind for a fully integrated system.  Listing on Euronext  In 2017, ahead of the launch of Kalray's third- generation microprocessor, Safran and Pengpai joined the company's historical investors (mainly CEA Investissement, ACE, INOCAP). In 2018, Alliance Ventures (strategic venture capital fund operated by Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi) and Definvest (an investment fund managed by Bpifrance on behalf of the French Ministry of Armed Forces) also acquired stakes in Kalray. On June 12, 2018, Kalray launched its IPO on the Euronext Paris Stock Market and raised ‚Ç¨47.7M (after exercise of the over-allocation option), \\"the most significant IPO since Euronext Growth was created in Paris\\".

Recorded in Nashville, Tennessee with former Wilco and Uncle Tupelo drummer Ken Coomer, it marked the first Frontier Ruckus album produced outside of the band's home state of Michigan. Rolling Stone announced the album in late 2016 and premiered a music video for the debut single \\"27 Dollars.\\" Reception With a more deliberate and polished production, Enter the Kingdom was met by a critical response ranging from laudatory to mixed. Thematically, the record was described in an interview with the Detroit Free Press as addressing economic hardship in songwriter Matthew Milia's immediate family and the disillusionment of childhood. These heavy lyrical elements were juxtaposed with frequent power pop song structures and the lush string arrangements of Zachary Nichols. British art magazine Aesthetica saw the album as \\"a swaying invitation into the suburban American household, offering a dreamy glance back into a past forgotten life.\\" Much notice was given to the precision of Milia's rhyme schemes, with legendary rock critic Robert Christgau commenting, \\"Somebody marry this winsome sad sack, whose increasingly plausible rhymes now include open-ibuprofen, gauche-precocious-neurosis, salad on the tennis court- valid passport, speckled melanin-freckled up your skin, and the very sexy errands-gerunds.\\" Mojo went on to say, \\"Well-educated, literary-inclined American songwriters are hardly thin on the ground, but Frontier Ruckus' Matthew Milia's poetic inclination always sets him apart.‚Äù Paste released the upbeat single \\"Positively Freaking,\\" showcasing the understated and melodic accompaniment of founding banjoist David Jones. Some fans of the rawer, more unhinged Americana from the band's earlier albums expressed disappointment in the new direction‚Äîincluding Uncut, who had championed the band's 2013 double- album Eternity of Dimming. Contrarily, AllMusic commended Ken Coomer's production and commented, \\"There's a warmth and personality in these performances that's honest and winning...and if this batch of songs sounds a bit more artful than much of Frontier Ruckus' back catalog, \\"If You Can\\" is beautiful and striking in its simplicity, with just a guitar, Milia's voice, and the sound of rainfall bringing an evocative depth to the tune.\\" They went on to call Frontier Ruckus one of the best things to come out of Michigan since Faygo Redpop. Vocalist Anna Burch joined Milia for an interview with NPR's Michigan Radio detailing her signature role in the band's sound since their debut album. A video for \\"Our Flowers Are Still Burning\\" featured Burch prominently, waking in the morning following the aftermath of a party. For the subsequent European and American release tours in support of Enter the Kingdom, Burch had officially returned to being the band's permanent bass player as well. In July 2017, Milia spoke with Billboard about taking time off from touring to work on a new Frontier Ruckus album, his upcoming solo album, and the music video for \\"Enter the Kingdom\\", which premiered on their site.

He is considered a founding father of the city of Santa Cruz. He also served as a member of the California State Assembly 6th District, 1880‚Äì81.  History  Born 30 November 1818 in Greenfield, in Saratoga County, New York to Asa and Sarah (n√©e Odell) Anthony, they moved often in his childhood and eventually landed in Indiana. His family were Quakers and he was raised as a Quaker. Prior to moving West, Anthony worked in Indiana as a Methodist minister. In 1845, Anthony married Sarah A. Van Anda in at Fort Wayne, Indiana. The family emigrated in 1847 on the Oregon Trail, leaving the main route for California. They took a Northern route of travel and decided to change course and head to California, despite the danger and crossing Donner Pass where one year prior in November 1846, the Donner family had died. They were hungry and struggled but made the journey and first arriving at Sutter's Fort and later at the Pueblo of San Jose (later known as the city of San Jose, California). Anthony helped establish the San Jose First United Methodist Church which was founded in 1847. Anthony arrived in Santa Cruz between December 1847 and January 1848 to work as a local Methodist Episcopal Church preacher. In the early years he bought a 18-acre lot of land, for which he held the title Alcalde. His land spanned what is now the downtown of Santa Cruz (the main area of the lot was near what is now the junction of Mission Street, Water Street and N. Pacific Avenue in downtown, the building no longer exists) and eventually developed the first commercial block in Santa Cruz called the Anthony Block. He built the first business, a blacksmith shop and sawmill that later became a general store. He invested in building real estate on a hill called \\"Anthony's Bluff\\" since uneven land was less preferred by the local Native Americans. When the Gold rush started in 1848, Anthony started manufacturing the pickaxes and other tools for mining, and since there were a limited amount of ironworkers in California during this time he made a great profit. In 1849 Anthony help build with industrialist Henry Cowell the first wharf, Cowell Wharf which was primarily used for shipping lumber and lime. It was later preceded by six other wharfs in a similar location, currently the only remaining one is the Santa Cruz Wharf. He was an abolitionist and a supporter of the Union Army during the American Civil War from 1861 until 1865. Starting in 1865, Anthony with Frederick A. Hihn built the first private water supply network in the city of Santa Cruz and serving nearby communities. Anthony had been the president of the local branch of the Workingmen's club, a group supporting the Workingmen's Party of California. The Workingmen's club introduced the anti-Chinese movement to the masses, because it was related to issues around cheap labor at the time. This sentiment led eventually to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. However, by 1885 it was a larger movement called the \\"Non-Partisan Anti-Chinese Association\\" headed by Anthony and Duncan McPherson, editor and publisher of the Santa Cruz Sentinel spread down the coast to local cities and towns. He died on 15 August 1905 at age 86 and is buried in Santa Cruz Memorial Park Cemetery.

Life cycle It is a type of flukes infecting the eyes of some species of fish, altering their movement patterns to suit its needs at different stages of development. The parasite infects snails and birds, sexually reproducing in the latter (its primary host) and asexually in the former (its first intermediate host), as well as many species of fish (its second intermediate host). When infecting a fish, it quickly moves into the fish's eye lenses, as they lack blood circulation, so the parasite is protected there from the host's immune system. This latter trait is probably responsible for the parasite's broad range of fish host species. Having infected the fish, the course of infection can be modulated by co-infection with Flavobacterium columnare.

Studios. It was created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Dan Mora. The comic is styled as an origin story, based on the re-imagining of Santa Claus as Klaus, as a former soldier of the town Grimsviig who was disgraced and exiled into the frozen wilderness, becoming a hunter with his pet white wolf Lilli, and how he restored joy to the sacred holiday Yuletide after it was outlawed by their diabolical leader Lord Magnus, in addition to trumping a far more ancient evil slumbering in the mines below. Three one-shots have been subsequently issued: Klaus and the Witch of Winter in December 2016, Klaus and the Crisis in Xmasville in December 2017, and Klaus and the Crying Snowman in December 2018. Plot = Part One = In medieval times, an independent trapper named Klaus enters the walled town of Grimsvig to trade furs and hides, and is distressed to find it much changed since the last time he was there. The town is ruled by the tyrannical Lord Magnus, who has conscripted nearly all of the town's men to labor in the nearby coal mine, and has instructed his guardsmen to systematically deprive the townspeople of joy, including canceling the annual Yuletide celebration and confiscating any toys or musical instruments to give to his spoiled young son, Jonas. Magnus himself rarely leaves his castle, shut in with his unhappy wife, Dagmar, and Jonas. Declaring that they do not trust strangers, the guardsmen confiscate Klaus's wares. At first he does not protest, but is outraged when one of the guardsmen strikes a nearby child, and is badly beaten when he tries to stop it. Marched outside the walls to be executed, he is saved by his pet white wolf, Lilli. Making camp in the forest, he falls asleep and is visited by the spirits of the forest. When he wakes up, he is stunned to see he has carved a large bag of wooden toys in his sleep. = Part Two = Despite the walls and sealed gates, Klaus slips into Grimsvig at night and distributes the toys among the children of the poorest families, and defacing a portrait of Magnus. Seeing the children playing in the streets, an outraged Magnus has his guards confiscate the toys, claiming that Jonas is dangerously ill and needs them more than the other children. When he demands to know who the mysterious intruder is, one child responds, \\"it was the Julernisse... the Yuletime Spirit.\\" Jonas is furious when the confiscated toys fail to give him any joy, and smashes them in a rage. His mother, Dagmar, notes one's resemblance to a carved bird from her childhood, which she has kept hidden, and realizes who the mysterious man is. When night falls again, Klaus tries to reach the gates, knocking out several guards (and building one into a snowman as a joke), before he is cornered by a pack of hunting dogs. = Part Three = The dogs are driven off by Lilli, allowing Klaus to escape the town. The guardsmen begin to whisper that the intruder is a ghost or a shape-shifter, while the children begin writing wishes on pieces of paper. Magnus orders his men to guard the doors of every house, so the children burn these wishes in their fireplaces, hoping they will reach \\"The Santa\\" through the chimneys. Magnus takes a grimoire from his library and enters the deepest part of the coal mine, alone, saying he has followed \\"the voice\\"'s instructions and soon it will be free. = Part Four = In flashback, Klaus's story is told: as an infant, he was discovered in the forest, clutched in the arms of his mother, who had frozen to death, but miraculously alive himself. He was adopted by Grimsvig's guard commander, Karl, who named him \\"Klaus\\", \\"Victory of the People.\\" As a boy, he befriended the lord's daughter, Dagmar, giving her a wooden toy bird to replace her deceased pet. They grew up together as best friends, while the young Magnus looked on jealously. Later, while the young Klaus was a captain of the town guard, Magnus poisoned the lord and put the blame on him, driving him outside the walls to die, but he was saved by Lilli, whose life he had spared while she was still a cub. In the present, Klaus enters Dagmar's window and confronts her, asking her how she could have thought him guilty of poisoning her father, or how she could have chosen Magnus over him. She has no answer, but he gives her a single toy for Jonas. At first, Jonas wants to smash it, but she sits down and encourages him to tell a story with it, and soon the two of them are playing happily, before Magnus interrupts them. He has a plan to trap \\"the Santa\\", using Jonas to write a wish letter. = Part Five = Jonas admits to Dagmar that Magnus frightened him into writing the letter by showing him the grimoire from the library. Before she can find it for herself, Magnus walks in on her, half- crazed, believing he is surrounded by enemies, in spite of everything he has done to make himself powerful and thus make life better for her and Jonas. Jonas's letter lures Klaus into a trap laid by Magnus's men, and he is barely able to escape the walls, wounded by a poisoned arrow. = Part Six = A young boy from the town, with Lilli's help, drags Klaus to his cabin in the woods, where he treats his poisoned wound, but Magnus and his guards follow them there, burning down the cabin and leaving Klaus staked to the surface of a frozen lake, expecting him to die of exposure. In preparation for a visit from the King, Magnus has the children of the town rounded up and herded into a room in the castle, where they are offered sweets to stuff themselves with. On the same night, a coal miner finally cracks the cell, releasing a huge demon. The demon enters the main hall of the castle, demanding its promised \\"feast\\" - the captive children. Outside Grimsvig, Klaus is visited again by the forest spirits and \\"changed,\\" imbued with new strength and told to \\"make [things] better.\\" = Part Seven = The boy who helped Klaus earlier leads the other captive children out of their cell and through the castle. In the main hall, Magnus's joy at the demon's arrival turns to horror when it attacks Jonas. He opens the grimoire to find the spell to command the demon, only for the demon to laugh and tell him that it used him to gain its freedom, and he has no power over it. Dagmar distracts the demon with an arrow and tells Jonas to run. Jonas meets the other fleeing children before they are all cornered by the demon. Before it can devour any of them, Klaus appears on a flying sleigh pulled by eight white wolves, and wielding a great sword. Klaus subdues the demon, but is stabbed from behind by Magnus, who demands that the demon fulfill its half of their bargain: giving him the kingship, and the love of his family and the people. Dagmar, finally admitting to herself that Magnus murdered her father, tells him that all the evil and misery in Grimsvig is his doing alone, and walks away from him with Jonas. Unhinged, Magnus screams at the demon to give him what he deserves - which it does by breathing fire and incinerating him. The demon seizes Jonas and converts Klaus's sleigh into a dark chariot pulled by hell hounds, and flies into the sky, declaring that \\"all bad children belong to me!\\" Klaus arises, telling Dagmar that the forest spirits have made him immortal. He leaps to a rooftop and jumps onto the chariot, declaring that \\"there are no bad children!\\" As the chariot flies into the upper atmosphere, the demon tries to burn Klaus, but its fiery breath doesn't ignite in the thin air, and with his trademark \\"Ho Ho Ho\\", Klaus beheads it. The demon's body plummets back to earth, and Klaus returns, in his now-restored sleigh, with Jonas. Dagmar promises the King that, with Klaus as her advisor, she will act as regent of the town, and undo her husband's wickedness. The Yuletide festival is held every year from then on, and the town recovers its joy, even Jonas, who abandons his old selfishness and learns to play with other children. As the years pass, Dagmar ages, but Klaus remains the same. After her funeral, Jonas, now middle-aged and the new lord of the town, sees Klaus preparing to depart in his sleigh to bring joy to the rest of the world, but promising to return once every year, when things are at their darkest.

It comprises a bronze statue of a marching soldier by Canadian sculptor Robert Tait McKenzie, known as \\"The Homecoming\\" or sometimes \\"Coming Home\\", mounted on a heavily carved limestone plinth. It was unveiled in 1922, and became a Grade II listed building in 1996. Background After the First World War, there were long debates in Cambridge about the appropriate type of war memorial, its location, and how the necessary funds should be raised, involving representatives of the city and the university. Proposals included a clock tower, cottages for injured soldiers, public amenities, or improvements at Addenbrooke's Hospital. The statue atop the memorial A memorial committee was convened in January 1919 by the Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire Charles Adeane, with its members drawn from Cambridgeshire County Council, the borough councils in Cambridge and Ely, and the University of Cambridge. Members included the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge Arthur Shipley (who was also Master of Christ's College, Cambridge); the Mayor of Cambridge Ralph Starr and his deputy, the previous year's mayor, Rev Dr Edmund Pearce (who was also Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge); Colonel Walter Harding of Madingley Hall and John Chivers from the Chivers and Sons jam making business in Histon; the Dean of Ely Cathedral Alexander Kirkpatrick (also former Masters of Selwyn College, Cambridge), the Mayor of Wisbech, and the surveyor Charles Bidwell of Bidwells. In April 1919, the committee recommended three parallel memorials: one at Addenbrooke's, a memorial listing the names of the war dead at Ely Cathedral, and a large monument in Cambridge itself. Fundraising carried on through 1919 to raise the estimated ¬£30,000 for all three works, two-thirds of which was earmarked for Addenbrooke's, but progress was slow. By December 1919, only ¬£12,000 had been raised, of which ¬£6,000 was donated to Addenbrooke's and put towards building a new nurses' home, which was competed in 1924; its origins as a war memorial had been forgotten by the time the hospital moved away from the Old Addenbrooke's Site in 1976. The colleges of the university contributed little, as they were raising funds to commemorate their own war dead in their own chapels (and very few of them had served in the Cambridgeshire Regiment), and towns and villages elsewhere in Cambridgeshire were also building their own local war memorials. A meeting on 16 October 1920 approved the memorial schemes for Ely and Cambridge. The proposed Ely memorial became a series of oak panels that were erected in St George's chapel, where the 6,000 casualties of the war are listed alphabetically, sorted by town and parish, without distinction of rank. The panels cost ¬£3,500, and were dedicated on 11 May 1922, with an address by General Lord Horne, commander of Eastern Command. The third memorial, the monument in Cambridge, was to become the Cambridge War Memorial. Shipley recommended the Canadian sculptor Robert Tait McKenzie to design a large sculpture of a soldier, to represent Victory, on a pedestal. The meeting also approved the site some distance south of the centre of the city of Cambridge, on Hills Road near the railway station. A site on Parker's Piece, closer to the city centre, used in the war as a parade ground, was rejected. Only ¬£3,500 was left from the fundraising towards the ¬£4,500 cost. To save money, the sculpture was reduced in height to . The architect was George Hubbard . Description The memorial is topped by a bronze statue of a soldier, wearing the uniform of the Cambridgeshire Regiment, slightly larger than life- size at tall. McKenzie modelled the soldier on Kenneth Hamilton, who was an undergraduate at Christ's College, Cambridge. The soldier marches purposefully with his rifle sloped over his left shoulder, his stride deliberately over- extended by several inches. He walks home up Hills Road, toward the centre of Cambridge, with a backward glance over his right shoulder along Station Road towards Cambridge railway station. He is bareheaded, holding his helmet in his right hand, which also clasps a rose, with another rose fallen at his feet. He carries a laurel wreath on his rifle, which also encircles a German helmet carried on his backpack as a trophy of war. The rectangular plinth is constructed of brick faced with limestone, with rounded ends like a sarcophagus. The top half of the plinth has high-relief carvings of armorial bearings. An inscription on the lower half is picked out with red paint: \\"TO THE MEN OF CAMBRIDGESHIRE / AND THE ISLE OF ELY, THE BOROUGH / AND UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE / WHO SERVED IN THE GREAT WAR / 1914‚Äì1919\\" to which was later added \\"AND IN THE WORLD WAR / 1939‚Äì1945\\" Reception The memorial was unveiled at the junction of Hills Road and Station Road at 3 pm on 3 July 1922 by the Duke of York (later George VI), who was already in Cambridge that day to attend the Royal Agricultural Society's Royal Show, and also to receive an honorary degree. The brief ceremony was attended by thousands of people, with crowds of schoolchildren, a guard of honour from the Cambridgeshire Regiment, ushers from the British Legion, and the Lord Lieutenant, the Mayor George Hawkins, and the Vice-Chancellor, now Rev Dr Edmund Pearce, in attendance; however, most from the university were away during the summer vacation.

The character first appeared in author Gary K. Wolf's 1981 novel, Who Censored Roger Rabbit? In the book, Roger is a second-banana in popular comic strip, \\"Baby Herman\\". Roger hires private detective Eddie Valiant to investigate why his employers, the DeGreasy Brothers, have reneged on their promise to give Roger his own strip. When Roger is found murdered in his home, Valiant sets out to look for the killer, with the help of Roger's \\"dopple\\" (in the book, comic characters can construct physical copies of themselves using their minds that last for only a few days). The book and character were later reenvisioned in Disney's hit 1988 live-action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. In the film version, Roger is a cartoon character in Hollywood during the Golden age of American animation. The various toons live in a Los Angeles enclave known as \\"Toontown\\", and act out animated shorts in the same way human actors act out feature films. Roger is framed for the murder of a famous Hollywood film producer and owner of Toontown, and he seeks out Valiant to help clear his name. In the film, the voice of Roger is performed by comedian Charles Fleischer, who was known for electing to wear an actual rabbit costume on the set to get into the role over the entirety of production. Background =Development= The character of Roger was created by author Gary K. Wolf, for his 1981 novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? Wolf was watching Saturday morning cartoons as research for new book ideas, when he noticed cereal commercial mascots such as Tony the Tiger and the Trix Rabbit. Wolf found it amusing that these commercials had real children interacting with cartoon characters casually and without question, and he decided to explore the concept in book form, eventually combining pulp fiction and true crime elements, and eventually creating the character of Roger Rabbit in the process. Published in 1981, Walt Disney Productions purchased the film rights that same year for $35,000. Wolf retains all story rights related to the characters and is allowed to write new novels featuring them, but Disney and Amblin Entertainment own the intellectual property rights. Before Richard Williams came on board for the film project, early animation tests for Roger gave him a simple and stylized look of a skinny white bunny with a purple nose. In these test animations, Roger was voiced by Paul Reubens. Subscribers to The Disney Channel (which was a subscription channel back in its early years) were able to see this test footage in the early 1980s. When the film went into full production, Roger was redesigned in a fashion to take elements from all the major cartoon studios of the period, the philosophy behind the new characters, in general, being a combination of Disney's elaborate animation style, similar characterization to Warner Bros. characters and capable of performing Tex Avery-inspired gags. =Physical appearance= Roger is a slender, white rabbit with large blue eyes, pink nose, a tuft of red hair who wears red overalls, yellow gloves, and a blue bow tie with yellow polka dots. He is an amalgamation of various classic cartoon characters, taking: Mickey Mouse's gloves, red pants with yellow buttons, and lack of a shirt; Bugs Bunny's rabbit form; Goofy's baggy pants; Pinocchio's blue bow tie; Sylvester the Cat's head and red nose; Wile E. Coyote's cheeks, and both Droopy and Claude Cat's red hair. Animator Richard Williams described the process of creating him like an \\"American flag\\" with the red overalls, white fur and blue bow tie so that American audiences would enjoy him subliminally. =Personality= Roger is zany, kind-hearted, humorous, energetic, a bit na√Øve and not very clever. He loves to make others laugh and is good friends with the other Toons, especially Baby Herman (his Maroon Cartoons costar) and Benny the Cab. He is also nervous and is intimidated of Judge Doom, the Dip, and the Toon Patrol as well as many other hazards. Despite his traditionally cartoonish behavior, Roger is aware of what most people think of cartoons, facts he's voiced to Eddie Valiant, in that making people laugh is often what makes toons' lives worthwhile, but also notes that there are times when making people laugh is the only weapon toons have. He believes that if someone doesn't have a good sense of humor they're better off dead and gets upset over having to sit through things such as newsreels that he perceives as boring. He truly loves his wife, Jessica, and always makes her laugh. Roger doesn't take well to alcoholic beverages. It's shown twice in the film that when he has consumed one, he changes color rapidly, at least one of his eyes swells, his head spins, and he mumbles incoherently at a fast pace, before stretching up into the air and whistling like a steam train at a loud enough tone to shatter glass, all the while spinning around. Appearances =Who Censored Roger Rabbit? (1981)= In the book, he is depicted as a six-foot-tall rabbit with white fur on his stomach and brown fur everywhere else. He is a second banana comic strip character who hires gruff alcoholic private eye, Eddie Valiant, to find out why his employers, the owners of a cartoon syndicate called the DeGreasy Brothers, refuse to give him his own comic strip or to sell his contract to another studio. This has Valiant interrogating several suspects, starting with Roger's co-star, Baby Herman, then talking to Roger's ex-wife, Jessica Rabbit, and finally Roger's photographer, Carol. Valiant then goes to the Rabbit's house and finds Roger's dead corpse lying over the banister, soaking in a pool of his own blood. Toon policeman Captain Cleaver and a human commissioner then show up at the house. Valiant then encounters Roger's dopple, who begs the toon-hating detective to prove his innocence and clear his name. =Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)= In the 1988 Disney/Amblin Entertainment film, he is re-envisioned as a character in 1940s animated cartoons and a resident of the fictional Los Angeles enclave, Toontown. He is framed for the murder of Acme Corporation C.E.O. Marvin Acme and seeks out Eddie Valiant to help clear his name. =Mickey's 60th Birthday (1988)= Roger notably played a significant role in the 1988 NBC special Mickey's 60th Birthday. At the beginning, during the taping of Mickey Mouse's birthday show, he is told to bring Mickey's cake to him, but in the process, he mistakes a stick of dynamite for a candle and puts it on the cake. Upon noticing his mistake, he attempts to blow it out but fails miserably and brings down the set in the process. Due to the resulting explosion, Mickey uses Yen Sid's magic to fix the place up and then shows off some more magic to his audience, only to disappear and have Yen Sid cast a spell on him. At the end, after the curse is lifted, Roger is the first to find Mickey (at Disneylands Main Street, U.S.A.), takes a selfie of himself and Mickey and is hailed as a hero for doing so on the front page of USA Today. =1990s theatrical shorts= Roger was featured in a series of cartoon shorts following the popularity of the movie. These shorts were presented in front of various Touchstone/Disney features in an attempt to revive short subject animation as a part of the moviegoing experience. These shorts include Tummy Trouble (1989), released in front of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (this was also included on the original video release of the film); Roller Coaster Rabbit (1990), shown in front of Dick Tracy; and Trail Mix-Up (1993), shown before A Far Off Place. Despite being produced by Disney, these shorts contained a heavy slapstick style similar to Warner Bros. Looney Tunes or Tex Avery cartoons. =Tiny Toon Adventures (1991)= He makes two cameos voiced by Steven Spielberg and Joe Alaskey in the show, once with Jessica Rabbit. *New Character Day (1991) - voiced by Steven Spielberg (as White Rabbit) *Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian (1991) - voiced by Joe Alaskey =Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit? (1991)= Roger is also a character in Wolf's novel, Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit?. In the book, Roger Rabbit is sure that Clark Gable has not only stolen the role of Rhett Butler in the soon-to-be-shot Gone with the Wind, but he has also stolen the heart of Jessica. Investigating the affair, Eddie Valiant, Toon protector, finds himself up to his fedora in murder and Hollywood corruption. The book is neither a sequel nor a prequel to Who Censored Roger Rabbit? or the film adaptation by Disney. It is a spin-off story with the same characters, just different situations. =Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996)= Roger and Jessica both make small cameo appearances. =Who Wacked Roger Rabbit (2013)= In Who Wacked Roger Rabbit?, the third novel in Gary K. Wolf's acclaimed Roger Rabbit/Toontown series, hard-boiled gumshoe Eddie Valiant lands a plum job as Gary Cooper's bodyguard while Coop scouts locations for his next movie‚Äîa screwball comedy titled Hi, Toon! But Eddie's dream job quickly turns into a nightmare. The film's being shot in Toontown, and Coop's co-star turns out to be none other than Roger Rabbit. Eddie's a big fan of Coop. Of Roger? Not so much. Now a sinister hoodlum is threatening to murder Coop if the movie gets made. Before long, Eddie, Coop, Roger, and the ever-glamorous Jessica Rabbit are embroiled in a mystery that could destroy Toontown. When Roger bites off more Toonish trouble than Eddie can swallow, the answer to the question, Who Wacked Roger Rabbit?, suddenly becomes no laughing matter. Like P-P-P-Plugged, the book is non-canon to either the first book, or the film. =Other appearances= A costumed Roger at Magic Kingdom's Main Street, U.S.A., Walt Disney World, Florida, in 2005. Roger occasionally appears as a meet-and-greet costumed character at Disney parks across the world. A costumed Roger was noticeably present at the opening of Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney's Hollywood Studios) on May 1, 1989. Roger and company appeared in the 1989 graphic novel, Roger Rabbit: The Resurrection of Doom, by Bob Foster and published by Marvel Comics. In the story, Roger and Jessica are thrown out of work when Maroon Cartoon Studios resorts to cheaper animation. Meanwhile, Judge Doom plots revenge as he makes a most unexpected and surprising return. Roger also starred in a comic book series published by Disney Comics from April 1990 to September 1991 and a spin-off series called Roger Rabbit's Toontown, published from June to October 1991, which featured Roger in the first story and supporting characters like Jessica Rabbit, Baby Herman, Benny the Cab, and the Toon Patrol. The series continues the adventures of Roger Rabbit, who has since returned to working for Maroon Cartoons, now under C.B. Maroon. The comics were usually split into two stories, with one main feature focusing on Roger's adventures, and a back-up feature presented to look like an actual animated subject. While Jessica Rabbit, Baby Herman and Benny the Cab all appeared in the stories, Eddie Valiant was seldom seen, replaced by a new detective character named Rick Flint. This was given an in-universe explanation in the first issue: Roger had a new case for he and Valiant to team up on, but Valiant told Roger he wouldn't be able to help him, as a result of his heavy workload. So to not leave Roger on his own, Valiant referred him to a \\"new kid\\" private detective, Rick Flint. The editorial reason for omitting Valiant from the comic was not having the likeness rights to Bob Hoskins outside of the first issue. Other new characters introduced were Lenny, a toon plane who was Benny's cousin, and Mel, who was Roger's sentient mailbox. The series had a one-off 3D strip as part of the \\"Disney's Comics in 3-D\\" series, which reprinted the back-up features of earlier comics and converted them into 3D. The Roger Rabbit comic book line lasted 18 issues, ending at the time of the Disney Comics implosion. However, new stories involving Roger and company continued to appear in the pages of Disney Adventures until after the May 1993 issue. A parody of Roger appeared in a 2009 episode of the Adult Swim stop-motion sketch comedy series, Robot Chicken (episode: Love, Maurice). In the sketch, Roger (voiced by veteran-Looney Tunes voice actor Bob Bergen) murders O.J. Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, in exchange for O.J. killing Roger's wife, Jessica. The sketch satirizes the infamous O.J. Simpson murder case. Other media *Roger Rabbit in literature *Roger Rabbit in comic books *Roger Rabbit in video games Legacy Benny the Cab, on the marquee of Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin at Disneyland California. Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin, a dark ride featuring Roger, opened at Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland. Roger has also appeared at other Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character. Andy Ape from the animated series Darkwing Duck is a parody of Roger. The Roger Rabbit became a popular dance move in America in the early 1990s.For example, fitness expert Monica Brant verifies her efforts to learn the dance in the 1990s in Monica Brant, Monica Brant's Secrets to Staying Fit and Loving Life (Sports Publishing LLC, 2005), 4.The dance is even used in the dedication of W. Michael Kelley, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Calculus (Alpha Books, 2002), ii. It was named after the floppy movements of the Roger Rabbit cartoon character. In movement, the Roger Rabbit dance is similar to the Running Man, but done by skipping backwards with arms performing a flapping gesture as if hooking one's thumbs on suspenders. The popular Disney Afternoon TV series Bonkers was long rumored to have originally been intended as a Roger Rabbit spin-off series, that ended up being scrapped due to licensing issues from Amblin Entertainment, with Bonkers being created instead. However, in 2008, Greg Weisman, who was a writer on the series, denied this. While confirming that the title character was inspired by Roger, and the Toontown concept had also been influenced by the film, Weisman insists that Bonkers was always meant to be his own character. Rappers MC Lars and Kool Keith wrote a song about Roger and Judge Doom on Lars's 2015 album, \\"the Zombie Dinosaur LP\\" called \\"the Dip\\".

In the General Law on Climate Change on 2012, Mexico promised to reduce 20% of its GHG emissions by 2020 and 50% by 2050, as well as in the Paris Agreement. 19% of this new mitigation plan will be dedicated to carbon capture and storage and specifically 10% to the energetic industry. Emissions Mexico produces many carbon dioxide emissions due to burning hydrocarbons. 90.2% of the energetic industry, 65% of the petroleum and 25.2% of natural gas depend on hydrocarbons. It was found that Mexico contributed to 1.67% of Earth's global emission, holding the 11th place as the most polluted country.Beltr√°n, Leonardo, Cesar Contreras, Jos√© Mar√≠a Valenzuela, Moises D√°vila, Vicente Ar√©valo, Oscar Jim√©nez, Erik Medina, Oscar Cuevas, and H√©ctor Ortega. \\"Atlas de almacenamiento geol√≥gico de CO2 Mexico.\\" Secretar√≠a de Energ√≠a/CFE, 2012. Web. 5 Apr. 2017. Out of the 483 million tons of CO2 emitted in 2010, 258 million tons correspond to stationary sources. The main source of greenhouse gas emission in the country is from the consumption and treatment of fossil fuels. Consumption and treatment of fossil fuels are held responsible for 60% of the overall GHG emissions, 75% of them being CO2. The activities that mainly contribute to the emission of greenhouse gasses are the generation of electricity, petroleum and natural gas, cement production, and metallurgy. In 2010, 407.3 megatonnes of CO2 were emitted only from energetic consumption. Also, each state is held accountable for their emission rate according to the industry and activities that take place in their region. Coahuila, emitted about 24 millions of tons, being the most pollutant state in the country. It is due to its electricity generating carbon plants and several iron and steel plants as well. Tamaulipas comes next in second place, generating about 19 million tons, followed by Campeche and Veracruz, that emitted 15.5 millions of tons of CO2 each. These last 3 cities, are the most feasible for CCS practices, given that they are in areas of exploitable petroleum, good for EOS. Sequestration There are four main types of sequestration: in deep saline aquifers, to fill up the hole where oil used to prevail, to replace underground methane with CO2, and to use EOR technology. Also, for sequestration to be plausible, reservoirs must be porous, permeable and deep. In Mexico, some areas meet these requirements and are ready for sequestering CO2. PEMEX, being the Mexican oil monopoly, is interested in obtaining as much oil as much as possible, which is why there has been previous and current investment in EOR. Along with Halliburton, a plant in El Carmito has been capturing carbon and sequestering underground to enhance its oil. It is estimated that since it started, it has been able to sequester 8,459,550 tons of CO2, representing a large number of barrels.For 40 years, we‚Äôve been putting C02 in its place. Carbon Capture and Storage. Halliburton, 2009. Web. 5 Apr. 2017. On the other hand, in the year 2000 it started this practice in Campo Artesa, located in the Five Presidents Area (Area de Activo Cinco Presidentes), where it has 4 wells of production. Also, in 2005, PEMEX invested in Campo Sitio Grande, which along with Campo Artesa, it is estimated to have recovered 950 million of oil barrels through EOR. In the same area, Activo Cinco Prsidentes, there is Campo Ogarrio, which is a pilot project title ‚ÄúComplejo Petroqu√≠mico de Cosoleacaque‚Äù to inject CO2 underground in the area known as ‚ÄúActivo Integral Aceite Terciario del Golfo‚Äù. This is all located around the Gulf of Mexico, which contains promising amounts of crude oil. The \\"Activo Integral Aceite Terciario del Golfo\\", is a pilot project that PEMEX, along with other companies have been designing to generate electricity with an emission-free idea. It has been under research on CCS feasibility, as well as possible applications and a financing plan. It started in 2012, where the CO2 has been captured under a 2 MW electric plant. The main areas that have been under investigation for sequestration are around the southwest, but some have already been dismissed. 3 of them, are around Sonora and Oaxaca, which at first it was thought to be feasible to serve the iron and steel industry: these being Fuentes (R√≠o Escondido), Terciaria del Golfo, and Sabinas Monclova. The last two, have been proven not to be economically viable because of its rocky body and discontinuity due to tectonic movement. Also, the entire west, specially around the Pacific and central part of Mexico, is not convenient for sequestration because of the high seismic and volcano activity and the fractures that already exist, may allow leakage. On the other hand, the some part of the republic is very promising for deep saline aquifer sequestration, since it was found that a large area is more than 800m deep. The 11 most promising provinces are: * Baja California * Sonora-Sinaloa * Chihuahua * Coahuila * Central Mexico * Burgos * Tampico-Misantla * Veracruz * Southeast Mexico * Yucat√°n * Chiapas The last six are ideal to store the total emissions due to the area's electrical industry. Altogether, it was calculated that around 100 gigatons of CO2 are capable of storage, so if the energy sector were kept constant, there would be enough room for the next 500 years. Projects in operation Currently, since Mexico‚Äôs Paris Agreement, the country has been working on CCUS Technology Roadmap or ‚ÄúMapa de la Ruta Tecnol√≥gica para CCS‚Äù. The government, PEMEX and Mario Molina Center have been involved in this project. It started in 2014 and is foreseen to launch in 2024, it currently is in the research and administrative stage. Its main research has been around the area of ‚ÄúCinco Presidentes‚Äù and other sequestration locations. The technology foreseen for capturing carbon is of post combustion that consists in capturing the gases resulting from energy and heat, then separating CO2 from that flue gas compressing it and transporting it through ducts and pipes for further sequestration. The project has been financed by the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit but also received international donations from countries and organizations such as the World Bank. Mexico has also been part of other projects in the past and associated with other organizations in the sector, including Global CCS Institute. Also, main governmental collaborators for these projects are PEMEX, Secretar√≠a de Energ√≠a (SENER), Comisi√≥n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) as well as the National Institute of Nuclear Research, where the principal research is being taking place. The nation has participated in Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF), CEM (grupo de acci√≥n sobre capture y uso y almacenamiento de carbon de la cumber ministerial de energia limpia), as well as collaborating with the US and Canada in other forums.

On 23 May 1799 the hired armed cutter Ann captured Aimable Therese, a small French privateer lugger of four guns and 27 men. At the time, Ann was in company with the sloop and Nox. Nox was under the command of Lieutenant Ulysses Hughes. In October 1799 Nox was under Hughes' command and stationed in the Downs. On 3 January 1800 Mr George Buckley, Collector of the Customs at Newhaven, received intelligence of a small, suspicious vessel off the harbour. He gathered Mr. Bound, Noxs Mate, some of her crew, his own boatmen, Mr. S. Cooper, master of Unity, some men of the coast artillery, and some other volunteers. The motley assemblage manned the Customs House's boat and four others and set out in chase. They caught up with their quarry after about two hours; the French vessel put a short resistance and then struck her colours. The captured vessel proved to be General Brune, of Dieppe, about 30 tons (bm), and armed with two carriage guns (not mounted), and small arms. She had a crew of 15 men under the command of Citizen Fleury. In June 1801 Nox was at Weymouth attending the royal family on their annual visit there. While she was there Lieutenant Thomas Ussher assumed command of her.Marshall (1827), supplement, Part 1, p.379. On 14 September Ussher and Nox captured the Swedish brig Louisa Cbarlotta.

It flows southeast from its source near the North Rim of the canyon to Tapeats Creek. The river is one of the shortest in the United States, and drops approximately over a series of waterfalls, making it the steepest river in the country. It is also a rare instance where a river is a tributary of a creek. History While Tapeats Creek was named by the second Powell Expedition in the winter of 1871‚Äì1872, the expedition did not discover Thunder River; European-American discovery of the river did not occur until 1904. The river can be reached by Thunder River Trail from the North Rim, which is only accessible from mid-May to late October. The upper portions of the trail were originally built in 1876 when rumors of placer gold led speculators to need a way into the area. Further trail work was performed beginning in 1925 under the US Forest Service and continued under the National Park Service with the final sections to Tapeats Creek completed in 1939. Source The creek is fed from Thunder Spring, the second-largest spring on the North Rim. Water emerges from the Muav Limestone in a deep cave system at approximately . Since the spring flows year round, the river is a perennial river. In 1970, the spring was estimated to discharge of water per day into the river. Environment Common trees near the spring include Fremont's cottonwoods and white sumac.

The play has been revived five times on Broadway and adapted for film four times; it is Kelly's most frequently produced play.Gussow, Mel. \\"A Lout, but a Lout Who Means Well,\\" The New York Times 6 Nov. 1992.  Production history  The characters and basic premise of The Show-Off first appeared in Poor Audrey, a one-act vaudeville sketch written by George Kelly that premiered in 1919 and \\"toured the country before and even during the run of The Show-Off.\\"Lynch, William J., ed. Three Plays by George Kelly. New York: Limelight, 1999. 166. Expanded into a three- act comedy of manners, the play opened on Broadway on February 5, 1924 at the Playhouse Theatre with Louis John Bartels as Aubrey Piper, Helen Lowell as Mrs. Fisher, and a 25-year-old Lee Tracy making his Broadway debut in the role of Joe. Kelly directed the play himself and demanded that the actors mimic his line readings; Tracy later recalled, \\"We used to beg [Helen Lowell] during rehearsals to make mistakes in her lines, so Kelly would get up and show her how it ought to be done. We loved to watch him. He acted the whole part right out for her.\\"Hirsch, Foster. George Kelly. Boston: Twayne, 1975. 29. Kelly envisioned the play as a \\"transcript of life,\\" and critics praised his naturalistic dialogue, with Robert Benchley writing, \\"The way in which every- day small talk and idioms are strung together, with scarcely a wisecrack or a gag-line to lend artificial brilliance, is just about as smooth a piece of work as we ever remember seeing.\\"Lynch, William J., ed.

The Negro Theatre Unit of the Federal Theatre Project of the WPA produced a revival that opened at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem on March 5, 1937, closing on May 8, 1937. The third Broadway revival of The Show-Off opened at the Arena Theatre on May 31, 1950, closing on June 17 after 21 performances. Lee Tracy, who had appeared in the original Broadway production, returned to the play in the role of Aubrey Piper, and the cast also featured Jane Seymour as Mrs. Fisher.

In 2017, an Off-Broadway revival starred Ian Gould as Aubrey Piper and Annette O'Toole as Mrs. Fisher; critics dismissed the play as a museum piece and likened the character of Aubrey, \\"a noisy know-it-all whose sense of truth is only marginally anchored in reality,\\" to Donald Trump.Stewart, Zachary. \\"REVIEWS: The Show-Off,\\" TheaterMania.com 28 Sep. 2017.Sommers, Michael. \\"Peccadillo‚Äôs Tone-Deaf Revival of George Kelly‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Show-Off‚Äù Is Nothing to Brag About,\\" The Village Voice 29 Sep. 2017.

A 1930 remake titled Men Are Like That followed, starring Hal Skelly and Clara Blandick. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer subsequently acquired the film rights to the play and remade it in 1934, as a vehicle for Spencer Tracy, and in 1946, as a vehicle for Red Skelton.  Context and influence  In 1992, the New York Times critic Mel Gussow observed that \\"The Show-Off was very much of its period, a time of expanding economic opportunity with ample room for go-getters to get ahead.

It was designed to be highly compatible with PKZIP on MS-DOS machines, reading and writing those files as well as performing any necessary line ending conversion or MacBinary encoding to ensure the files were usable on both platforms. It had an advanced user interface and offered a number of automation features, including AppleScript support. First released in 1993, the latest version of ZipIt is version 2.2.2, released in late 2002. History A unique feature of the original Mac file system was its use of forks, essentially two separate files that the Finder maintained the illusion of being a single file. Files that were copied to other storage media automatically copied both forks. Systems that did not support this feature risked the problem of transmitting only one of the two forks, producing an unusable file. This led to a number of archive formats that combined the two forks along with any extended metadata into a single file suitable for hosting on other platforms. The original PKZIP archive format did include a number of features intended to help support other file systems like the Mac, including things like longer filenames and some basic metadata. However, it did not support forks, and therefore was not directly capable of supporting Mac files in ZIP archives. This did not present a major problem in many use-cases, as the Mac had archive utilities that did support these features, like StuffIt and Compact Pro. By the early 1990s, the ZIP format was becoming almost universal and a number of systems required it for data exchange. Notable among these were FidoNet mailers and offline mail readers like the QWK format. For those times when Mac users had to exchange simple files, like a text file, with a PC user, utilities like UnZip and MacZip worked with single files. These did not include a Mac-like interface and were suitable for only the most basic tasks. ZipIt was introduced to address this problem by explicitly modeling the program's user interface after Compact Pro, which was lauded as one of the easiest to use archivers available. ZipIt essentially replaced Compact Pro's own internal compression system with PKZIPs, producing a program that looked similar but read and wrote ZIP files instead of CPT. ZipIt also included a number of automation features, notably support for AppleScript, which allowed it to be used with programs like Freddie, a QWK reader. A setting in ZTerm allowed downloaded ZIP files to automatically be associated with ZipIt, making download-and-open a simple task. The initial stable version, 1.1.1, was released in March of 1993. It allowed multiple archives to be opened or created, each one in a separate window. That version did not support hierarchical directories, instead, it encoded all of the files into a single-level archive. This had the downside that it would only allow one file with any given name in an archive. This was addressed in the 1.2.x versions, of which version 1.2.6 of 1994 was the final classic-MacOS release. In 2001, version 2.0 was released. This version supported both Mac OS X and Mac OS 9. In tests with 1.1.1, ZipIt consistently outperformed both Compact Pro and StuffIt in terms of compression, by about 10% on average. Its speed was about the same as StuffIt, making it about half the speed of the very fast Compact Pro.

He was the Democratic Party's nominee for the June 20, 2017, special election for South Carolina's 5th congressional district of the United States House of Representatives. He narrowly lost the election to Republican Ralph Norman, receiving 47.9 percent of the vote in the general election, an unexpectedly close margin. Parnell challenged Norman again in the 2018 election to lose again having earned 41.5 percent of the vote.  Early life and education  Parnell grew up mostly in Sumter, South Carolina, where he currently resides. His family also lived in several places including the U.K., Germany, and Florida, where his father Archie Parnell Sr. was stationed with U.S. Air Force. Parnell Jr. attended Willow Drive School through sixth grade and, after his family returned to Sumter, graduated from Sumter High School. He then attended the University of South Carolina, where he earned a B.A. degree and a J.D. degree. He later earned a LL.M. degree from Georgetown University.  Early career  Parnell worked as a tax attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice and for the House Ways and Means Committee. While serving as senior staff counsel for the committee, he also wrote articles that were published in the Catholic University Law Review and the Yale Law Journal. Parnell later worked as a tax attorney for Exxon Mobil for ten years. From 1996 to 2016, he worked for Goldman Sachs and was a managing director for the company‚Äôs Hong Kong office. He retired from the position before declaring his intention to run for U.S. Congress.  Political campaigns  = 2017 election campaign = In March 2017, Parnell announced his candidacy for the position formerly held by Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, who resigned from his congressional seat to become budget director on Trump administration. Parnell was new to politics but was the first Democrat to announce his candidacy for the 5th District seat. By the time he entered the race, seven Republicans had also announced their candidacy for the district that is increasingly leaning towards the conservative party and a Republican was first elected in 2011 when a Democrat, John Spratt, who had held the seat for a long time lost to Mulvaney. Two other Democratic candidates also entered the race: Alexis Frank and Les Murphy. Spratt endorsed Parnell in the Democratic primary held on May 2, 2017. He also gained the endorsement of other Democrats in the state including Jim Hodges, formerly the Governor of South Carolina. Parnell won the primary with 71.3% of the vote to become the democratic nominee. A number of television advertisements of Parnell's drew national media notice. In it, he imitated the fictional character Frank Underwood, who represents what appears to be the South Carolina 5th district in the television show House of Cards.Emily Tillett. Archie Parnell, South Carolina Democrat, channels Frank Underwood in campaign ad. CBS News, May 31, 2017 Although Parnell's own internal polls predicted that he was 10 percentage points behind his Republican opponent, Ralph Norman, Parnell lost the June 20 election by a small margin, earning 47.9% percent of the votes to Norman's 51.1%. Fewer than 3,000 votes separated the two candidates. A Politico analysis attributed Parnell's relatively high vote percentage, given the district and the special election timing, to his humble, positive, and funny ad messages, and his avoidance of standard partisan conflicts and rhetoric. Parnell spent approximately $500,000 on his campaign through the end of May 2017. In addition to his unique advertising and campaign strategy, his close margin has been attributed, in part, to low Republican turnout. = 2018 election campaign = On October 9, 2017, Parnell announced that he would challenge Norman for a full term in the regular 2018 election. He again released a humorous campaign ad that gained national attention. In the ad, he was depicted getting a tattoo, receiving a haircut at a local barbershop, and playing Go Fish with Congressman Jim Clyburn. In January 2018, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee added the election in the 5th district to its \\"Majority Maker district\\" list which the political party was targeting with the hope of gaining towards a majority in the 116th United States Congress. On May 21, 2018, an article in Charleston's Post and Courier revealed the discovery of court documents from Parnell's previously undisclosed 1973 divorce. Parnell's wife was granted a restraining order and a divorce \\"on the ground of physical cruelty.\\" No charges were filed. Parnell did not challenge the statements at the time or after their 2018 discovery. After the news story broke, some of Parnell's campaign staff quit, and South Carolina Democratic Party officials called on Parnell to withdraw from the race. Parnell chose to remain in the race. On June 12, 2018, he won a four-way Democratic primary with approximately 60% of the vote. He lost to Norman in the general election, taking 41.5 percent of the votes to his opponent's 57.1 percent.  Academic career  Parnell was an adjunct faculty member of the University of South Carolina School of Law. In 2018, he taught a course in \\"International Business Structures\\" at the law school. In 2020, Parnell joined the faculty of the O. P. Jindal Global University in Sonipat, India.

Plot Single mother Lisa Decker drops off her young daughter, Julie, for her first day of kindergarten. She watches on as Julie is joined by two other girls, Kayla and Sam. Kayla's dad Mitchell and Sam's dad Hunter introduce themselves and become close friends after seeing the bond between their children. Twelve years later, Julie shares with Kayla and Sam that she plans to lose her virginity to her boyfriend Austin at prom. Kayla pledges to do so as well, though on a casual basis with her lab partner, Connor. Sam, a closeted lesbian, joins the pact to cement the bond with her two best friends. She goes to prom with the harmless Chad. Lisa sets up a pre- party for the parents and kids. The girls then head to the prom, texting each other about their sex pact. The three parents hear Julie's laptop and intercept the messages. Hunter deciphers their emoji codes, and they realize the girls' pact. Lisa and Mitchell rush to stop their daughters, but Hunter tries to stop them. Hunter shares his intuition that Sam is gay, but at the first party, he sees her force herself to kiss Chad. Wanting to protect Sam from doing something she doesn't want to do, he joins Lisa and Mitchell's crusade. Having been told that the after-party would be at Austin's house, the parents go there. Instead, they find Austin's parents Ron and Cathy engaging in sex games. After some awkward moments, Ron reveals that the after-party is at a lake house, but refuses to give the address. The trio realizes that Mitchell's wife Marcie may have it, and go back to his house. Against Marcie's wishes, who defends their daughter's rights, they retrieve the address. As they follow the girls from party to party, it becomes clear that each parent has their own motivation. Mitchell is overprotective and in denial over his daughter growing up. Hunter feels guilty for neglecting Sam during his bitter separation from her mother, who cheated on him. Lisa is struggling to let go of her only child and is offended by Julie's plans to go to distant UCLA. Knowing that Austin and Ron have been texting, the parents return to Ron's house, intending to grab his phone. After barging in on the couple playing a blindfold sex game, Hunter is forced to go along with it as Mitchell grabs the phone, which reveals that the girls are at a hotel. At the hotel, a drunk Sam goes to bed with Chad but decides she does not want to have sex, though she does give him a handjob. Kayla and Connor go off together, but she also changes her mind upon realizing her flippant attitude to her virginity, and they limit their sex to Connor performing cunnilingus for Kayla. When Mitch finds Kayla with Connor, she is initially furious, but ultimately appeased by her father's good intentions. Hunter finds Sam and they also share a tender moment, where he reveals that a good night was the best he could give her in return for his neglect. After, Sam officially comes out to her father, who is deeply moved at being the first person she told. Lisa sneaks into Julie and Austin's room and, realizing how much the two clearly love each other, she sneaks out unnoticed, leaving the two alone. The three adults acknowledge that their own friendships have been strengthened. Their daughters are also closer, with Sam coming out to them, to which Julie and Kayla are extremely supportive. They leave Sam with her crush, Angelica, who shares a romantic kiss with her. Three months later, Sam and Kayla drive with Julie to California. As they drive away, Lisa starts receiving the girl's group text, filled with plans to get drugs and have condom-less sex. As the three parents run for the car, the girls text that it was a prank, and a final \\"I love you\\" to them. In a mid-credits scene, Mitchell and Marcie are playing the blindfold sex game that Austin's parents had been playing earlieronly to be found by a shocked Kayla.

Brian Lowry of CNN.com found that \\"the movie gets by on sheer energy\\" and praised director Kay Cannon for creating \\"some truly blue sequences and sight gags that yield explosive laughs [and] largely compensate for the arid patches, as do the warm/fuzzy exchanges, which smartly play off the idea of raising your children and then trusting them enough to let go.\\" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film 2 1/2 stars, saying that it is \\"the kind of comedy one could stumble upon late at night on HBO and thoroughly enjoy, but it strains under the weight of its tonal inconsistencies in a movie theater.\\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two out of four stars, giving credit to the cast but saying they were not given much to do: Describing Blockers as \\"absurd and funny\\", Amy Nicholson of Uproxx favorably compared screenwriters Brian and Jim Kehoe to American Pie directors Chris and Paul Weitz as \\"brothers trying to do right by the sexual politics of the time.\\" Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out gave the film four out of five stars, calling it \\"a wonderfully crude film... in which the overall vibe is sweet\\" and a \\"hilarious, parents'-eye view of teenage sexuality.\\" Describing Blockers as \\"highly dubious and not very funny,\\" Adam Graham of The Detroit News stated that the film \\"awkwardly tries to balance gross-out gags with tender, warm- and-fuzzy moments. It's a tough trick to pull off, and Blockers gets stuffed at every turn.\\" David Sims of The Atlantic stated that \\"Blockers works because of the time it invests in its teenaged characters. Each is a delight, particularly the supremely chilled-out Kayla (who decides to lose her virginity largely on a whim) and the more introverted Sam (who knows she‚Äôs gay but hasn‚Äôt quite figured out how to tell her friends and family).\\" Praising the themes of the film, Ann Hornaday from The Washington Post wrote: = Accolades = In 2019, the film was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film ‚Äì Wide Release. Blockers was among 20 of 2018's 100 highest- grossing films awarded The ReFrame Stamp for recognition in \\"standout, gender- balanced\\" films, and also one out of four Stamp recipients with a female director. Music The film features the hit single \\"Love Myself\\" by Hailee Steinfeld, which appears twice in the film.

The circus and entertainment company was founded in 1993 by Artistic Director Gregangelo Herrera, a whirling dervish, aerial arts choreographer, and drummer. The company's signature performances incorporate multiculturalism, ensemble aerial acts, optical illusions, immersive entertainment, and interactive play. Operating both one-out events and a variety of immersive shows, the troupe and entertainment company create performances and experiences with a cast of local San Francisco and Bay Area artists, including several artists they have sponsored from around the world.TEDxYouth@Castilleja-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=737HdHJYzOQ For twenty-five years, Velocity Circus has remained an independent company, without federal or private grants or program funding. Though an independent, entrepreneurial set-up is unusual for most circus troupes, the troupe has experienced a range of financial and commercial success. Gregangelo's Velocity Circus/Arts and Entertainment is commissioned by non-profits, festivals, museums, corporate entities, and tech startups to create immersive experiences and fully produced shows. Gregangelo's Velocity Arts and Entertainment Company has created performances and installations, etc., for Warner Bros., Microsoft, Lucasfilm, Lexus, Univision, Yelp, Cisco Systems, and Mercedes-Benz. For every show, performers double as crew members for Velocity Arts and Entertainment, tailor the costumes, and pitch ideas. The arts and entertainment company works in tandem with the circus, providing all of its multi-media, motion media, music, costume, makeup, hair and wigs, technology, writing, scenic, lighting, special effects, installations, infrastructure, photography, painters, sculptors, makers, and any other in-house visual and aesthetic support. The Gregangelo Museum serves as the company headquarters. Origins Gregangelo Herrera was seventeen when he started his Saturday night show at the Pasha Club as a whirling dervish, drummer, and folkloric dancer. The supper club had a Moroccan fantasy aesthetic and was a metropolitan spin on Sahara City, a small Middle Eastern circus in Cairo. Gregangelo Herrera developed the act in a direction that was more futuristic and modern than the traditional Dervish act he was hired to perform and was consequently fired three times. However, they rehired him three times as well. During this period in his adolescence, he trained in dance and developed his whirling dervish act with Amina Goodyear, a cultural dance and music teacher who owned Aswan Dancers. Susu Pampanin, one of the Aswan Dance teachers in drumming, locally produced the Cairo Cat performance, where Herrera performed as an ensemble drummer. The community performances gave Herrera exposure at a young age and was formative to his philosophy about money and art. At the age of eighteen, Herrera declared an individualized major at California College of the Arts, which incorporated multimedia, textiles, cultural studies, videography, woodworking, and drawing. The major he created allowed him to produce shows later on. Paying for school as he attended, Herrera worked at a contemporary art gallery called Japonesque. He also traveled to the remote areas in the Middle East with school grant money and earned credits for cultural studies while he continued to develop his artistic career. Gregangelo Herrera was training at the San Francisco School of Circus Arts (Circus Center) to develop his aerial arts skills when he met Zeina Asfour, another circus performer of Lebanese descent. While training together, surrounding circus performers began to collaborate with Herrera, gaining an interest in his artist for-profit mentality. Herrera began choreographing circus acts that employed a Middle Eastern sensibility while incorporating aspects of astrophysics. In interviews and through his museum tours, Herrera points to how momentum, velocity, and the natural elements interplay in the circus field. For example, he still employs the laws of physics into the themes and titles of his choreographed performances. Herrera became aware of the Big Bang theory in the 1990s;Notes from in person tour in 1992 scientists witnessed through a telescope what they thought was a universe coming into existence. Obsessed with the Big Bang theory, Herrera wanted a company name that described the force of everything that exists in the universe. Thus, Herrera thought the equation for velocity (velocity equals distance over time) fit the kinetic nature of circus arts, performance arts, and the arts in general. Finding that art comes into existence through movement is very characteristic of the traditional Whirling Dervish philosophy. Productions (Circus and Arts and Entertainment) =Neptune Act= With an early start at the Circus Center, Herrera produced multiple aerial acts. During the Neptune Act, aerial artists performed in pitch black lighting, wearing UV reactive costuming. Appearing on the apparatus at abnormal times gave viewers the idea that the performers were appearing and disappearing. Herrera would continue to employ this multimedia technique throughout other shows. =Heliosphere and Heliosphere Jr.= Velocity Circus Arts and Entertainment company's global and continental exposure increased after the show Heliosphere went on tour to county festivals around the United States as a for-hire circus troupe. Paul Del Bene co-wrote the show, which attempted to look at the solar system and beyond the solar system, and was composed of stand alone acts based in astrophysics, such as a double contortion act called Eclipse, a fire act called Solar, and the whirling dervish act called Vortex. Encapsulating the company's Arabic and physics based aesthetic, the show attracted regional and national festivals and theaters. Though it started as a show geared towards adult viewers for its revealing costumes, mature humor and concepts, Velocity Circus was commissioned to tighten up Heliosphere for a family audience. Heliosphere Jr. was created as an adaptation to the original Heliosphere featuring the same interactive and immersive tactics. Another purpose of the acts were to introduce world culture all over the United States, in an effort to bring San Francisco multiculturalism to small towns in middle America.The Cincinnati Enquirer. Cincinnati, Ohio. Friday, May 21, 2004. Page 131. The show was assembled with the goal of engaging youth while serving as an educational platform, though they have no formal educators in training, the Legion of Honor has employed the circus troupe many times to continue performances that double as educational platforms. =Heliopolis= Heliopolis was commissioned for the Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs exhibition at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. The production attempted to provide a panorama of Egyptian history, mythology, folklore and fantasy. The performance featured hypnotic hand dances, hoops of fire, contortionists, aerialists, and snake charmers. The cast included 20 artists. =Fa Femina Miss India Pageant= Velocity Circus' India show at Fa Femina Miss India Pageant adopted some of the acts from Heliosphere while incorporating new acts that featured an Indian inspired dance act, a Persian fire act, and an Egyptian whirling dervish act. The performance in Hyderabad, India, attracted Velocity Circus' largest television audience to date. Immersive Experiences =Illuminated Garden Performance and Installation= The Illuminated Garden was commissioned by tech companies and took place in a park in Palo Alto, California. The performance followed the arc of the day, starting at noon and ending at midnight. The show was an interactive performance where the audience became the characters in the show, flying on the trapeze, climbing and crawling through interactive installations and investigating the world through a circus experience. Audience members' faces were projected onto a 16-foot tall video sculpture titled the PyramID. Velocity Circus scheduled a brief break for dinner, during which, the garden became illuminated in glow-in-the-dark LED lights. Audience members wore 3D glasses and walked through a 3-dimensional labyrinth, wading through grass reeds and flowers as floating aerial artists swung overhead in lit-up orbs. =Human Logos= In a rebranding campaign, Mercedes-Benz and Univision commissioned Herrera to recreate their logos by using aerial artists to hang suspended in mid-air. =Collaborators and Competitors= Gregangelo Herrera has collaborated with some of his would be competitors, but Velocity Circus is still not completely competitor free. The circus arts have been popular in San Francisco, and long time standing circus arts organizations like Acrosports and the San Francisco Circus Center, that were once collaborators now compete for show bookings. Other close relatives of the circus arts compete for commissions and have similar platforms to Velocity Circus. Vau de Vire Society is a San Francisco born company that features burlesque aesthetics, musicians that double as circus performers, and provocative music. As Velocity Circus has honed in its skills to appeal to younger audiences and family events for example the kid's section at the Parade of Tall Ships, Vau de Vire is just one of the circus troupes that appeals to adult life that is booming in San Francisco. The circus can be very sexual in many respects, and Velocity Circus shows employ mature jokes that seem harmless on the surface, using rhetoric like \\"deflowering\\" and \\"seeds\\" at county festivals where the towns are known for their produce. A circus troupe in Pennsylvania, Double Blind Productions, has very similar concepts as Velocity Circus, including a narrative show much like Velocity Circus' shows, called Escape Velocity. The troupe is self proclaimed comedians, artisans, aerial artists and musicians. Kinetic Arts Center is a Bay Area based circus troupe that also offers classes to the general public and competes with Velocity Circus in marketing their shows. Herrera himself believes in collaboration, and avidly makes a point on his CCA alumnus page about the benefits of artistic collaboration especially as funding for the arts decline in today's political atmosphere. Some of Herrera's collaborators are Trapeze Arts Incorporated, Earth Circus and Trapeze World. Incidents and Contentions In 2015, Velocity Circus had a problem with their generator and an ice rink show had to be cancelled. Since then Lighting of the Embarcadero Ice Rink has only used Disney on Ice.

Born in New Augusta, Indiana, a community which has since been incorporated into Indianapolis, Florence Bartley graduated from the local high school in 1922. From then until 1926 she attended the John Herron Art Institute; she also had lessons at the Grand Central School of Art and the Art Students League of New York. Her instructors included William Forsyth, Paul Hadley, George Pearse Ennis, Richard Lahey, and Harry Sternberg. She showed work at the Hoosier Salon in 1929 and 1930 and at the Indiana State Fair from 1929 until 1934, winning prizes from both entities; she continued exhibiting for the rest of her career, showing mainly watercolors and drawings. On June 17, 1927, she married physician Kenneth C. Smithburn, moving with him to New York City in 1930. In May 1937, she had a one person show of her paintings at the Argent Galleries. She eventually accompanied him to Africa, after a stint visiting the galleries of England, France, and Italy. In 1938 the couple settled in Entebbe, where for ten years she painted scenes of local native life while her husband researched yellow fever for the Rockefeller Research Institute. She contributed her artistic skills to the work of the Yellow Fever Research Institute (currently the Uganda Virus Research Institute) by creating maps to illustrate their scientific publications. Smithburn rarely sold her paintings due to financial security; her husband died in 1974, and she died in Indianapolis in 1989. Stylistically, Smithburn has been characterized as a Regionalist painter. One of her lithographs, Untitled (Gust of Air From Subway Grate) of c. 1935, is owned by the National Gallery of Art, and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University. She is also represented in the collections of the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Georgia Museum of Art. She was a member of the Hoosier Salon, the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors (NAWPS), and the Indiana Artists Association.

She is one of the authors of \\"Te Atua Mou E\\" (\\"God is Truth\\"), the national anthem of the Cook Islands. She was president of the House of Ariki from 1980 to 1990. Early life Pa Tepaeru Terito was an only child, born on 14 August 1923. Her father died four months later. Her mother then remarried. She was raised and educated by her great paternal uncle, Makea'nui Tinirau Teremoana Ariki, head of the Makea Nui Ariki, and his wife Tutini. She was appointed as Pa Ariki at the age of one in 1924, thanks in part to the support of Tupe Short,\\"It seems that Pa Terito appointed in 1924, was brought in to the status through the actions of Tupe Short.\\" In re Pa Ariki (2004) CKHC 3; Application 286.2004; 2 July 2004, paragraph 20 an important member of the Kainuku Ariki family, and probably of Makea Nui Tinirau. She was the 47th person to hold the title of Pa Ariki. In 1934, Pa Terito attended school in New Zealand at the Hukarere Girls' College in Napier. She returned to the Cook Islands in the mid-1940s to assume her role as ariki. She worked as a secretary for the government and later for a private firm. Conversion to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith In the 1950s, Pa Terito converted to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, becoming the first non-Christian ariki. Her conversion seemed to anger some of the people of Takitumu. According to her, \\"One of the ministers said to me: 'Pa Ariki, you really have to do something about being a Baha'i. Your people are very angry with you'. (...) My People (held) a meeting (and said): 'Young lady, your ancestors accepted the Gospel' and all this kind of thing and I said: 'Yes, they had their reasons and I've got mine. What you are asking me? Give it up? I would rather give you up. If you ask me to give the title up and leave the country or give up being Baha'i, I'd leave the country.' And they looked at me, because ma'am, they knew I meant it.\\" Her cousin, Makea Nui Tapumanoanoa Teremoana Ariki, also did not approve. \\"She said to me, 'I do not like you being Baha'i, it's against our family tradition.\\" Pa Terito promised that there would be no attempt to proselytize on her part and agreed to attend the Sunday service at the Cook Islands Christian Church in Ngatangiia. Family life Pa Terito married George Tamarua Ani Rima Peyroux in 1946.Son of Jean Dominique Peyroux, a French Navy sailor who settled in Rarotonga in the early 20th century. They had nine children, three sons: Teariki-Upoko-O- Te-Tini-Tini (Sonny), Hironui Maoata Rapu Malcolm and George Meredith Ani Akatauira, and six daughters: Marie Rima Desiree, Mahinarangi Margaret, Bambi Tetianui O Pa Paiaoro, Isabell, Kairangi Elizabeth, and Memory Teariki Tutini Memory Teao Manea. In 1977, she was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. After a divorce, in 1979 she married Tom Davis, then Prime Minister of the archipelago, in a Baha'i ceremony. As an ariki, she refused to be called \\"first lady\\", saying \\"I do not mind being addressed as 'queen' but I do object to the 'first lady'. I did not have to marry a politician to become a first lady. I was born a first lady!\\" Pa Terito's relations with her husband were sometimes difficult. She repeatedly opposed his political decisions. In March 1986, she openly criticized plans to open a resort in Muri on tribal lands.This was an immense project for which the construction between the island and the motu located offshore was foreseen. It seems that the discussion that ensued in the intimacy of the couple turned into a fight, at least that is what the local rumor, very active in the Cook Islands, asserted. The local and New Zealand press also echoed it. Geoffrey Henry took the opportunity to ask for the resignation of Tom Davis, evoking marital violence. Davis then disappeared for a few days. Officially he had accidentally injured himself, suffering from cuts to the ear, chest, and groin, which fed the rumor all the more. A neighbor living near the couple said, on condition of anonymity, \\"if the cut in the groin had been longer than a half inch, Sir Thomas would today be a soprano in the church of Ngatangiia.\\" This accounting was later denied by Pa Terito, who declared that her husband had injured himself in his sleep by turning onto a hunting knife. The hotel project was abandoned. Death Pa Terito died suddenly on 3 February 1990 on a plane that brought her to New Zealand to attend Waitangi Day, which commemorates the Treaty of Waitangi. The Cook Islands had two days of official mourning following her death. Her state funeral was attended by thousands. She was buried according to the Baha'i rite. Her eldest daughter Marie Peyroux succeeded her to the title as Pa Tepaeru Teariki Upokotini Marie Ariki.

Her 1996 book, Anna's Story, about the death of 15-year-old Sydney teenager Anna Wood, became a national bestseller. The book sold over 100,000 copies and was reprinted in 2005. Her other works included Leaving Early, about youth suicide, and Unzipped, about sexuality among teenagers. Early life Donaghy was born in Newcastle, New South Wales. Her father worked as an insurance agent and the family moved often, spending large amounts of time in both Tamworth and Lismore. After her completion of high school, she trained as a journalist at Lismore's Northern Star newspaper and began her journalistic career. Career After Donaghy's work in Lismore, she joined Network Ten in the late 1960s to work as a researcher and reporter. She also presented Sunday Magazine and Young World. In the early 1970s, she travelled to England and began work in London, on trade publications. She returned to Sydney in 1973. After a hiatus from journalism to prioritise her family and raise her children, she began freelance writing, specialising in family issues. Donaghy's work appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia's Parents magazine and New Woman. Donaghy also wrote a long-standing column, under the pseudonym Frances Storm. In late 1995, Donaghy was approached by editor Jennie Orchard at Harper Collins to write a book about Anna Wood, who had died in October 1995. Wood had been at a rave with friends in Ultimo, where she had taken an ecstasy tablet and collapsed. Her friends drove her to their home in Sydney's Northern Suburbs, where they put her to bed, hoping she would sleep off the effects of a bad pill. Unbeknown to them, Wood had suffered hyponatremia, dangerously low salt levels, as the result of excessive water consumption. Her brain had swelled and she collapsed into a coma the following morning. Donaghy was reluctant to pursue the story, and approached the project with caution. After meeting Anna Wood's mother, Angela, she was struck by the normality of the family. Donaghy noticed the possibility of a recurrence which she felt would strike a chord with the Australian public-particularly teenage girls. The book questions the duality of teenage freedom and parental restrictions, as well as Wood's portrayal of a wholesome, albeit slightly insecure and unsure girl next door. The book highlighted the urgency of a dialogue between parents and their children about illicit drug use, which was an issue of increasing importance in Australia at the time-up until Wood's death, there had only been one other reported death from ecstasy.\\"A date Amanda didn't live to keep\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 6 June 1991 Anna's Story was released in 1996 and became a best-seller. It was translated in German and sold in Europe. In Australia, it has sold over 130,000 copies (2018). The success of the book led to Donaghy's covering of two other adolescent health issues: teenage depression and suicide, in Leaving Early (1997). Her following work, Unzipped: Everything Teenagers want to know about Love, Sex and Each Other (1999) was covered with a humorous approach. These three books are Donaghy's most well known works, however she published two more books in the 1990s: Keeping Mum: Stories of Happy Parenting and Other Lies, (1997), was a tongue-in-cheek book written as a guide for parents highlighting relationships and trust in teens and adults. Donaghy had also penned a children's fairy tale called Two and a Half Wishes. Death Donaghy was diagnosed with a bone marrow disorder (myelodisplesia/aplastic anaemia) in 1999 and became dependent on blood transfusions in 2002. Donaghy had been scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant in August 2002. She passed away on 23 July 2002 surrounded by family. Personal life Donaghy met her husband, Frank Donaghy, a Northern Irish physicist in London in the 1970s. They married in Sydney and had three children, Aidan, Anna and Liam.

He governed the BCEN-Eurobank in France from 1927 to 1929. In addition, he served as a consultant to the French Popular Front to offer advice on combating the economic crisis in France. Ideologically, Navachine was a socialist but his politics and theories were more closely associated with the Popular Front, not Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. Although well-respected for his economic views in France, Navachine nonetheless created many enemies both there and in the Soviet Union. He was assassinated in 1937 but his case still remains unsolved.  Biography  Dimitri Navachine was born in Moscow on 30 August 1889. After the February Revolution in 1917, he was assigned to the vice presidency of the Red Cross under Alexander Kerensky's newly formed Russian Provisional Government to oversee the treatment of German prisoners during World War I. Perhaps due to his experience with economics and his invaluable connections in the West, Navachine managed to stay in good favor with the Communist Party when it seized power late in 1917, despite being a Kerensky supporter. At first critical of the new government, Navachine nonetheless assisted with restoring the country's economy, devastated by war and revolution. The Soviets' first important assignment for Navachine was to send him to Spain in 1921; as a diplomat, Navachine negotiated with Spain to exchange its petroleum reserves with the Soviet Union rather than Royal Dutch Shell. In 1927, Navachine was assigned to Paris to assume the directorship of BCEN Eurobank which was responsible for the Soviet Union's financial matters in France. He resigned from the position in 1929 and either worked for or with a group of right-wing bankers connected to the Banque Worms. After Joseph Stalin's rise to power, Navachine elected to remain in France, advising the French Popular Front, a political party that shared his ideological views, during France's economic crisis in the 1930s. L√©on Blum's economic minister Charles Spinasse collaborated closely with Navachine who also published a two-volume study on the issue. Well-respected for his input, Navachine counseled Spinasse to disband the industrial cartels in France. Navachine assassinated on 25 January 1937 Some historians insist, despite claims by Navachine that he cut ties with the Soviet Union in 1929, he engaged in espionage on behalf of the Soviet government. French detectives, however, could find no evidence of him engaging in acts of espionage beyond the early 1930s. By 1937, having already declined a summons to return to Moscow, Navachine was faced with open hostility from Soviet agents. Worse still, he created enemies with anti-Semitic groups who were aware of his counsel in final political parties. Death On the morning of 25 January 1937, while walking his fox terrier dog in Bois de Boulogne, Navachine was assassinated, stabbed to death in an incident still unsolved by French police; he was 47 years of age. His assassination has been connected to at least three other murders carried out during a state of ongoing violence in France: Italian anti-fascist dissidents Carlo and Nello Rosselli, and undercover agent Laetitia Nourrissat Toureaux. Panteleimon Takhchiyanov, an officer of the NKVD, is suspected to have carried out Navachine's assassination, possibly to silence him before he released evidence proving the innocence of Soviet political prisoners. Another theory argues his attack was coordinated by the fascist extremist group La Cagoule to create fears of Communist conspirators in France. His remains are interred at Montrouge Cemetery.

The novel is set in a New York City that has been flooded and altered by rising water. The novel received generally positive reviews. Setting The novel occurs mostly in a fictional future New York City, permanently inundated by two major rises in seawater levels caused by climate change. Most of New York City is permanently underwater, however, people still live in the upper floors of the buildings, much like in the Venice of today. Most of Manhattan below 46th Street is flooded, and has earned the nickname \\"SuperVenice\\". Several of the book's characters live in the MetLife Tower on 23rd Street, which the tenant association has outfitted with flood-prevention mechanisms and boat storage. Robinson chose to prominently feature the building as it was designed to resemble the St Mark's Campanile in Venice. The wealthy live in newly constructed skyscrapers in Uptown Manhattan and near The Cloisters, as both locations remain above water. Denver has replaced New York as the center of American finance and culture, and much of the United States has been deliberately abandoned by humans in order to make room for wildlife. Robinson has previously addressed sea level rise directly and indirectly in his works Aurora, 2312, and the Mars trilogy. =Scientific accuracy= The book is set in a New York City suffering from a 50-foot rise in seawater. However, scientists suggest a rise between is more likely by 2140. A rise on that scale would likely mean that some portions of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens would be flooded, but not to the extent as featured in the novel. According to Robinson, he set the novel in 2140, as he wanted the setting to be recognizable, while the sea-level rise in the novel was possible but \\"extreme\\". Themes The novel is critical of capitalism, unregulated financial systems, and market economies. Many of the citizens of the city live in communes and rely on organizations that pool resources, while the wealthy live in former office buildings and newly built skyscrapers above 125th Street and in Yonkers. Reception According to the literary criticism aggregator Literary Hub, critics gave the novel generally positive reviews. Gerry Canavan, writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, referred to the novel as a further step in Robinson's \\"[...] construction of a huge metatextual history of the future...distributed across overlapping but distinct and mutually irreconcilable texts\\".

Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, s.v. Gittin 5:6, p. 313 (note 6) or else where Roman citizens had received property (real estate) that had been confiscated by the state in the laws prescribed under ager publicus,Josephus alludes to this law in The Jewish War, VII.6.6 (VII, 216), where he says that \\"Caesar (Vespasian) gave order that all Judea should be exposed to sale.\\" Although not conclusive, Emil Sch√ºrer thinks that this may have referred to the lease of confiscated Jewish property by non-Jewish tenants (farmers), with the money accruing unto the Roman treasury. See: Emil Sch√ºrer, Die Gemeindeverfassung der Juden in Rom in der Kaiserzeit (The Congregation of the Jews in Rome in the Imperial Age), Leipzig 1878, v. i p. 640. See also term, ager publicus, in Adolf Berger's Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law, vol. 43, part 2, Philadelphia 1980 , p. 357. Berger, citing Charles Giraud (Recherches sur le droit de propri√©t√© chez les Romains, p. 163), writes that in such cases the lessee paid monies for the lease either in periods of five years (quinquennial leaseholds) or perpetually, i.e. , by emphyteutic lease or copyhold. From these lands the Roman treasury (fiscus) received an income of from one-tenth to one-fifth of the annual crops. and to which the original Jewish owners of such property had not incurred any legal debt or fine, but had simply been the victims of war and the illegal, governmental expropriation of such lands from their rightful owners or heirs. The original Jewish law, made at some time after the First Jewish-Roman War with Vespasian and his son Titus,Such is the opinion of Talmudic exegete, Rashi (1040-1105), and Maimonides (1138-1205), as well as the historian, Heinrich Graetz (1817-1891), although Israeli historian and Israel Prize laureate, Shmuel Safrai (1919-2003), thought that the sicaricon laws were initiated only after the Second Jewish-Roman War with Hadrian in around 120 CE (see: H. Graetz, Das Sikarikon-Gesetz [The Sikarikon Act], Breslau 1892).Cf. Encyclopedia Judaica, vol. 2, Keter Publishing House: Jerusalem 1971, p. 395 (s.v. Agriculture), where it writes: \\"Josephus relates that, after the destruction, Titus issued a decree expropriating Jewish landholdings which he ordered sold or leased out (Wars, 5:421). At first these lands were acquired mainly by Gentiles who leased the plots to the former Jewish owners, and these later tried to buy back their land. To assure the restoration of the lands to their former Jewish owners, the talmudic sages enacted ordinances forbidding competition and speculation in land (BB 9:4; TJ, Ket. 2:1, 26b; Git. 52a, et al.).\\" saw additional amendments by later rabbinic courts, all of which were meant to safe-guard against depriving the original landowners and their heirs of any land that belonged to them, and to ensure their ability to redeem such property in the future. Etymology The origin of the word sicaricon (or saqrƒ´q≈´n) is now obscure. The word is believed by some to be a corruption of the Greek word œáŒ±ŒπœÉŒ±œÅŒØœáŒπŒøŒΩ, or what is called in Latin caesaricium.Marcus Jastrow, Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature (2nd edition), Massachusetts 2006, p. 986, s.v. ◊°◊ô◊ß◊®◊ô◊ß◊ï◊ü Others, namely, Heinrich Graetz and M.S. Zuckermandel, think the word to be derived from Sicarii, a group associated with murders, brigandage and robbery during the Second Temple period.Heinrich Graetz, Das Sikarikon-Gesetz [The Sikarikon Act], in: Jahresbericht, Breslau 1892; Tosephta - based on the Erfurt and Vienna Codices (ed. M.S. Zuckermandel), Jerusalem 1970, Appendix (p. LXXVIII), where he writes for the word in the glossary: \\"sicarii mit Beil bewaffnete\\" (Sicarii armed with hatchet). See also Daniel Sperber, A Dictionary of Greek and Latin Legal Terms in Rabbinic Literature, Bar-Ilan University Press: Ramat-Gan 1984, pp. 120-121, who takes the same view. Hai Gaon also thought that the word Sicarii refers to government personnel involved with implementing the laws of Sicaricon.Rabbi Hai Gaon's Commentary on Seder Taharot, cited in Babylonian Talmud (Niddah Tractate), s.v. Mishnah Makhshirin 1:6; also in The Geonic Commentary on Seder Taharot - Attributed to Rabbi Hai Gaon, vol. 2, Berlin 1924, s.v. ◊°◊ô◊ß◊®◊ô◊ß◊ô◊ü. However, the Sicarii are largely mentioned in regard to assassinations, and there is no historical evidence to connect them with the expropriation of land.Encyclopaedia Judaica, vol. 14, Jerusalem 1996, p. 1530, s.v. sikarikon The author of Sefer Arukh brings down a different interpretation, saying that the word is merely an acronym for: ◊©◊ê ◊ß◊®◊ß◊¢◊ô ◊ï◊î◊†◊ô◊ó◊†◊ô (= \\"Take my land, but leave me alone\\"), a view supported by Talmudic exegetes, Rashi and Solomon Sirilio.See Rashi's commentary on Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 55b, and Solomon Sirilio's commentary on Jerusalem Talmud, Bikkurim 1:2, s.v. ◊°◊ß◊®◊ô◊ß◊ï◊ü Isaac ben Melchizedek, echoing the same view, held that sicaricon were hired \\"hitmen,\\" sent to embezzle the original landowner of his property at the threat of death., s.v. Bikkurim 1:2 (p. 404) In any case, the word unanimously refers to a Roman or foreign molester who expropriates land from its Jewish owner, usually by a decree made by a tyrant king (Caesar).Tosafot RID (Isaiah di Trani on Gittin 55b; Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham on Mishnah Bikkurim 1:2, Maimonides on Mishnah Gittin 5:6, et al. Status of sicaricon during the war During the height of the Jewish war with Rome, and especially after Caesar (Vespasian) had given order that all Judea should be exposed to sale (The Jewish War, VII.6.6 [VII, 216]; 5:421),Josephus, The Jewish War 7.216. The Greek word used to describe the phrase \\"exposed to sale\\" (Gr. ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ¥œåœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ) has also the connotation of lands leased upon payment. Latin: Jus in re aliena. the law of \\"the usurping occupant\\" did not apply to cases where the Jewish landowner in Judea was compelled to relinquish his property to a Roman tenant (usually a farmer) or to face death.Mishnah Gittin 5:6; in Danby's edition of the Mishnah, p. 313. Several reasons are given for this, one of which being that the Roman authority had given license to kill Jewish property owners during the war, and therefore, to avoid death, the Jewish landowner was seen as willingly disposing of such property in order to save his own life.Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 55b, Rashi ibid., s.v. ◊õ◊ú ◊ì◊ú◊ê ◊ß◊ò◊ô◊ú.Menachem Meiri, Beit Ha-Bechirah (Gittin 55b, s.v. ◊ê◊û◊® ◊î◊û◊ê◊ô◊®◊ô), Jerusalem 2006, p. 129 (Hebrew) Such transactions in Jewish law were deemed as valid,Maimonides, Code of Jewish law (Hil. Gezelah we'avedah 10:1-3) since one's intent under such pressure is real and without pretense. In yet other instances, some Jewish landowners never despaired of retrieving their stolen property, so that whenever the sicaricon took away their field and sold it to another, the original landowners would come along and forcibly take it away from those to whom it had been sold, until at length no one dared buy from the sicaricon for fear of being confronted by the original property owners, leaving the entire country of Judea in the hands of the sicaricon and seemingly irredeemable.Jerusalem Talmud (Gittin 5:7, 31b), explanation given by Talmudic exegete, Moses Margolies, in his commentary Pnei Moshe. First enactment After the war, and in those cases where the Israelite owners were slain in battle, the rabbinic court in Israel began to apply the laws of \\"usurping occupant,\\" since no longer did the Roman authority give licence to kill Jewish property owners,Meiri on Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 55b while the heirs of such property were, in turn, no longer fearful of being killed and could seek legal redress for the restoration of such property. This enactment was also made to ensure the continued Jewish settlement in the towns and cities across Judea, a country then largely occupied by the sicaricon.Tosefta, Gittin 3:10-11 Any prospective buyer of such expropriated land was first required, by rabbinic edict, to gain the willful consent of the land's original owner, or of his heirs, before he could legally purchase the field held by a sicaricon. The original Jewish owner, or his heirs, retained the right of first refusal. In so doing, the buyer did not appear to give a semblance of legitimacy to the Roman law.Isaiah M. Gafni, Land, Center and Diaspora (Jewish Constructs in Late Antiquity), Sheffield 1997, p. 68 However, had he bypassed the original landowner and broached the issue of buying the property first with the \\"usurping occupant,\\" even if the original landowner should later give to him his consent, the transaction is considered null and void and can be challenged by the original owner in a court of law, who can claim that he only gave his consent to satisfy the usurping occupant, but in reality he was never pleased with the sale.Rabbi Yom Tov Asevilli on Gittin 55b, s.v. ◊û◊™◊†◊ô (p. 75, note 545); Rashba Primacy is given to the original landowner to reclaim such property, or at least to give his consent to the sale of property held by the sicaricon before it is reclaimed by another. If, however, the original owner or heirs were never consulted about selling their property and the buyer made the transaction between himself and the sicaricon alone, yet the usurping occupant gave to the original owner the payment which he received from the buyer, and the original owner accepted it, the transaction is deemed as valid.Rabbi Yom Tov Asevilli on Gittin 55b, s.v. ◊û◊™◊†◊ô (pp. 75-76, note 546) Likewise, if the field in question was seized in consequence of a debt or fine by its original owner (insolvency), or as payment for damages, the current holder of the field cannot be divested of his property.Maimonides, Code of Jewish law (Hil. Gezelah we'avedah 10:1-2). The laws concerning sicaricon did not apply to chattels (movable property). Second enactment The first enactment was later amended to better ensure compensation to the original owners or heirs of the field. The new enactment required that any prospective buyer of a field known to have been confiscated and held by a \\"usurping occupant\\" after the first Jewish-Roman war must, upon purchasing the field, give to the original owner of the property (or to his heirs) either a quarter of the land that is reclaimed, or else one-third of the purchasing price.Mishnah Gittin 5:6 (other editions, 5:7); Maimonides, Code of Jewish law (Hil. Gezelah we'avedah 10:3) According to Ha-Meiri, this is made payable by giving to its original owner 100 for a field that is offered by the \\"usurping occupant\\" at 300; one-hundred being one-third of 300, and one-fourth the original cost of the field before its depreciation., Gittin 55b, s.v. ◊†◊©◊ï◊ë The original owner may accept either money or land at the said rate of compensation. This enactment was made in consideration of the fact that the sicaricon (usurping occupant) had presumably depreciated the value of the real-estate to the value of three-fourths of its original cost, since he had obtained the field without cost and would incur no loss had he sold the field at a bargain price. This rule applies when the original owner or heirs are in no position to buy the field for themselves, which if they were, they would have the right of preemption. For example, if a field was sold by the sicaricon at thirty denarii, the purchaser must give ten denarii in remittance to the original owner or heirs of the field, since it is generally assumed that the value of the field was originally appraised at forty denarii.Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 2, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1965, s.v. Gittin 5:6 (p. 152) Third and final enactment In the days of Rabbi Judah HaNasi (others say, in the days of Rabbi Yehoshua),Thus is it explained in Mishnah Gittin of the Jerusalem Talmud, Leiden MS., according to Shmuel Safrai (see: \\"Sikarikon,\\" ed. Shmuel Safrai, Zion, pub. by Historical Society of Israel, 1952, pp. 57 [2]‚Äì58 [3] [Hebrew]). This view seems to have been rejected, since the Gemara of the Jerusalem Talmud states explicitly that Rab, a disciple of Rabbi Judah HaNasi, was present in the court when this final enactment was made. the rabbis convened a court where it was decided by vote that any man could secure the title to a field held by a sicaricon (usurping occupant) after the field had been in the possession of the \\"usurping occupant\\" for at least twelve months without it being redeemed by its original owner, provided that he gives a quarter of the purchased field or the monetary equivalent of one-third the cost of purchase unto its original owner or heirs.Mishnah (Gittin 5:6) This enactment is believed to have been the result of certain decrees made by Pertinax and which affected all territories falling under Roman suzerainty, including Judea.See pp. 7‚Äì8, 18‚Äì20 in: (Hebrew) The novelty of Rabbi Judah HaNasi's enactment is that after twelve months, no longer would it require the consent of the original land owner to buy a field held by a sicaricon.Cf. Shulhan Arukh (·∏§oshen Mishpa·π≠ 236:1) If the sicaricon agrees to sell the field, a quarter of the field or else one-third of its purchasing cost must be given by its buyer to the original owner.

Given Coppi‚Äôs high profile, this affair led to the shift in attitudes among the Christian Democrats in Italy towards the moral and legal aspects of adultery. At the time in Italy, divorce was not permitted and adultery was still a crime. Occhini herself was tried for abandoning her marriage. Her story became emblematic of the conformist and repressive climate of that period.De Zan, p.75 Her nickname originated after the 1954 St. Moritz stage of the Giro d'Italia, when Pierre Chany, a journalist with L'√âquipe, wrote: \\"We would like to know more about that lady in white (dame en blanc) we saw near Coppi,‚Äù referring to the snow-coloured duffel coat she wore.  Biography  Fausto Coppi, Giulia Occhini and their son in 1959 Occhini was married to Enrico Locatelli, a medical practitioner in Varano Borghi, and who was a passionate fan of Coppi. She met Fausto Coppi during the 1953 Tour at the end of the Passo dello Stelvio stage and publicly appeared with the \\"Campionissimo\\" at the World Championships Prize 1953 in Lugano. Their friendship started in 1948 when the Locatelli had asked his wife to obtain an autograph of the \\"Campionissimo\\" at the end of the Tre Valli Varesine. Later Occhini entered into correspondence with Coppi, who, solicited by Locatelli, personally met his family in a short visit to Varese. A romance began between Occhini and Coppi and they spent the summer together as lovers in 1953, vacationing in Capri. Since they were both married, the relationship aroused great scandal at that time and was strongly opposed by public opinion, particularly by Fausto Coppi's fans, and Occhini was even the recipient of Pope Pius XII's public condemnation. Coppi and his wife, Bruna Ciampolini, unanimously separated in 1954, while Locatelli denounced Occhini for adultery. As a result of this, according to Italian law of time, the lovers having been caught ‚Äúin flagrante‚Äù, the woman was punished with a month's imprisonment in Alessandria and then a period of house arrest in Ancona. Coppi‚Äôs passport was withdrawn. Among these many difficulties, Coppi and Occhini married in Mexico (a marriage never recognized in Italy) and Occhini gave birth to a son, Angelo Fausto Coppi, who was born on May 13, 1955 in Buenos Aires. Coppi died of malaria on January 2, 1960, which he caught on a trip to Burkina Faso. Giulia Occhini was admitted to San Giacomo Hospital in Novi Ligure following injuries sustained in a car accident that occurred just in front of Villa Coppi in hamlet Barbellotta of Novi Ligure on 3 August 1991 on board a Fiat Tipo, driven by a family friend, who was hit by a Volkswagen Golf GTI with two young people on board.Dama Bianca, sei anni in fuga con Coppi Archiviolastampa.it She died on January 6, 1993, after having been in a coma for almost a year and a half.

Topsy Smith (1874- 1960) was an Arabunna woman born at Oodnadatta is a pioneer of Central Australia in the Northern Territory of Australia. She spent her life caring for Indigenous children at an institution known as The Bungalow in Alice Springs. Early life Smith is of Arabunna descent from the Oodnadatta area, in northeast South Australia. She married a Welsh miner William 'Bill‚Äô Smith who was working at the Arltunga goldfields. They had eleven children. When Bill died in 1914, Smith decided to return to the Oodnadatta area, but only made it as far as Alice Springs, then known as Stuart. She was pregnant at the time and was accompanied by seven of her children and a herd of goats. Her eldest child was legendary bushman Walter Smith who remained in Arltunga to work after his father's death. Topsy and her children were assisted by pastoralists Jane and Ted Hayes from Undoolya Station, with whom them lived for some time before moving on to Alice Springs. When she arrived in Alice Springs, Smith lived in a tent. She herded her goats on a hill which was then the outskirts of town, a place that became known as Billy Goat Hill. Eventually the sergeant of police Robert Stott constructed a shed where she was permitted to live. The shed eventually became known as The Bungalow, an institution and school for Aboriginal children of mixed descent. The school was moved from the iron shed behind the police station to Jay Creek and then to the Alice Springs Telegraph Station in November 1932. Along with Ida Standley, Smith became actively involved in the running and management of the school, responsible for the children's welfare. She was known to have cared for her children as her own. Legacy Topsy died in the Alice Springs hospital on 6 April 1960. Her gravestone in the Alice Springs Memorial Cemetery has the date of her death and her age as 86, with the inscription - \\"Beloved mother of Walter, Maude (dec), Jim, Willie, Emily, Ada, Jean & Clarry\\" She is celebrated in the Women‚Äôs Museum of Australia in Alice Springs.

The exception it stated was, having been shunned in run-of-the-mill contract cases for around a century, in 1999 reinstatated and broadened by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Facts In this case a son contracted with his father not to fell and sell the timber from their oak wood which the son would then inherit, and in exchange, he would pay ¬£1000 to his sister on her marriage. The sister married after the father's death, and the son refused to make good the promised sum (). Decision of court of law and of the court of equity In this case Scroggs C.J. with strong reasons permitted the sister to appeal from the decision of a more junior judge of his court despite the legal prohibition caused by her not being a party to the contract (privity of contract), on the basis that she was a close family member. Scroggs held that \\"apparent consideration of love and affection from the father to his children [means] the consideration and promise to the father may well extend to the children.\\" An appeal by the son to the Court of Chancery (i.e. in the then sometimes conflicting domain of the law, the courts of equity) reinforced the determination for his sister.Dutton v Poole CEC (1679) T Raym 302, 83 ER 156.

He was the first of the Rongwo Drubchen tulku lineage, and an important figure for Buddhism in Amdo, a region of north-eastern Tibet. The founder of a religious college and a seminary for tantric studies in Rebgong, throughout his life Kelden struggled between his desire to become a recluse hermit and his responsibility to these institutions. While he was ordained and taught in the Gelug school, he had a special affinity for Milarepa, the legendary Tibetan poet of the Kagyu school. The information that survives about Kelden comes from a biography by Jangchup Mila Ngawang S√∂nam (1636-1716), and from his poetry and songs, both written down and performed today by monks in Amdo. Life =Early life and study= Kelden Gyatso was born in 1607, in Rebgong, Amdo, Tibet. His birth was foretold; his father is said to have been promised ‚Äúthree famous sons‚Äù by a clairvoyant siddha. One of these sons, Kelden's older brother Ch√∂pa Rinpoche (1581-1659), was 26 at the time of Kelden's birth and already established as a monk; he would later become Kelden's teacher. Kelden was briefly raised by Ch√∂pa, who gave him lay vows, and took him to √ú-Tsang to become a monk. At eleven, the thirteenth Ganden Tripa gave him his novice vows at Ganden monastery, but he soon moved to Drepung monastery to actually complete his schooling. There he studied scriptures and tantric ritual for nine years. At age twenty, Kelden received full ordination from the Fourth Panchen Lama, Lobsang Ch√∂kyi Gyaltsen, in Lhasa. He long regarded √ú-Tsang as a place of more spiritual awakening, compared to his home in Amdo which he regarded as ‚Äúbarbarous‚Äù. =Return to Amdo and later life= Shortly after, he returned home to Amdo, where he planned to pursue a removed, ascetic lifestyle. His older brother, however, made him promise to found a school. He thus converted the Sakya Rongwo Monastery in Rebgong to the Gelug school and established it as a religious college. Eighteen years later, he founded a seminary for tantric studies, where mountain hermits could study tantric practice before returning to their hermitages. He took care of these schools until his death. Struggles =Backwardness of Amdo= Amdo is described by Kelden Gyatso in his mgur as having once been a spiritually awakened place, but having since fallen to disrepair. He laments this not only for the sake of the people, but also for his own sake, as he sees this backwardness as a direct barrier to his own awakening. When the 5th Dalai Lama, Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso, traveled through the region in 1653 on his way to China, Kelden Gyatso met with him to offer gifts and receive teachings. In his mgur, he describes how the Dalai Lama converted a number of local deities, such as Machen Pomra, a mountain deity of Amdo. Gyatso thus likens the Dalai Lama to the legendary Padmasambhava, the master who first tamed the local deities of Tibet during the first transmission of Buddhism. The need for this kind of ritual conversion also demonstrates the lack of Buddhist teaching in Amdo. =Mongol rule= Throughout the Kelden's life, Amdo was occupied by Mongol tribes. They had entered the region in the 1500s and held it since; in Kelden's lifetime it was used as a springboard to enter into central Tibet. The Kagyu school had held significant power over central Tibet until the middle of the 17th century, when G√ºshi Khan of the Khoshut Khanate invaded and installed the 5th Dalai Lama (a Gelugpa leader) as the political leader of Tibet. This marks the beginning of the Gelug school's dominance over Tibet and paved the way for the expansion of Buddhism into Amdo. While Kelden was a part of the Gelug school, and his ability to establish a monastery and religious college at Rongwo was likely linked to Mongol rule and patronage, he still saw this rule as detrimental to the region and its people. From Mgur XI-10, Mongol dominance to the Tibetans escalated cultural tensions, especially in regards to Buddhist practice, which Kelden always prioritized. =Obligations to institutions= The college and the seminary were some of Kelden's crowning achievements, and yet he often viewed them as barriers to his own personal practice. He goes so far as to disparage the very institutions that he himself founded, saying In 1670, just seven years before his death, Kelden finally stepped away from these institutions and retreated to the mountains, where he spent his final days. Legacy =Rongwo Drubchen line= Kelden Gyatso was the first of one of the most important tulku lineages in Amdo, the Rongwo Drubchen line. This tulku lineage was closely tied to the institutions Kelden founded in his lifetime. The line survived until 1978, when the 7th Rongwo Drubchen died. Nothing is known of this lineage holder's life beyond the age of 27, when he took over as the head of the college Kelden had founded at Rongwo monastery. =Buddhist resurgence in Amdo= Along with the larger Gelug rise to power, Kelden Gyatso is seen as instrumental in the revival of Buddhism in Amdo in the 17th Century. According to his biography, he had many students in his lifetime, many of whom followed his example by returning to their own regions and founding colleges and seminaries for tantric studies.

Nico played for the Halifax Mooseheads in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) and was selected 1st overall by the New Jersey Devils during the 2017 NHL Draft. Nina also played volleyball at a high level in Switzerland. There were no rinks in Naters, so Katja took both her sons to nearby Visp to learn to skate and they discovered hockey there.

The red area represents Roman territory in 338 BC, at the end of his first consulship. Quintus Publilius Philo was a Roman politician who lived during the 4th century BC. His birth date is not provided by extant sources, however, a reasonable estimate is about 365 BC, since he first became consul in 339 BC at a time when consuls could be elected in their twenties (Livy 7.26.12). His Greek cognomen ‚ÄòPhilo‚Äô was unique to his family. Lucius Papirus, who shared his several positions with Quintus, is presumed to have been his brother. His family was plebeian, and the gens won its first attested election via Publilius Volero as tribune in 472 BC. Volero passed two important pieces of legislation which increased the power of a Tribune. Clearly, Philo came from a family accustomed to promoting the rights of the plebs. The Publilian gens is said not to have had any prominent descendants. However, the noble woman Publilia, who lived about 154 BC, may have been a relative of Philo. She was accused of murdering her husband, a former consul, despite Publilia's plebeian status Livy per. 48.13. Another potential later member of his gens include Titus Publilius who was one of the ‚Äúfive augurs of the plebs‚Äù, about 299 BC.Livy 10.9.2. Early career Publilius first became consul in 339 BC. During his first term, he retaliated against the Latins who sought to reclaim territories that were previously lost to Rome. He was supported by the other consul Tiberius Aemilius Mamercinus. The most prominent event was Philo's assault on the Latin forces camped in the Fenectine Plains. Philo remained on the defensive of Latin territories while Mamercinus attempted to besiege Pedum.Liv.8.12.12-17 During the same year, Philo was appointed dictator. Philo was the second plebeian to hold the office of dictator, the first being Marcus Rutilius in 356 BC. He made a series of popular reforms championing the rights of the plebeians. Such measures included legislation binding plebiscites on all citizens, giving the Comitia Centuriata greater involvement in voting on laws, and ensuring that one censor must always be a plebeian. In 336 BC, Philo's reputation as a novus homo within the Roman senate was consolidated even further when he became the first plebeian praetor. Philo's ascension to the praetorship was opposed by the incumbent consul Sulpicius who as a patrician believed a plebeian was undeserving of the office.Liv. 8.15.9. Furthermore, Philo served as magister equitum (Master of the Horse)Liv.7.2.1. in 335 BC. A Master of the Horses was an emergency magistrate appointed by the Dictator, who held also imperium. It is likely Philo had a political partnership with his family, as he shared this position with his (probable) brother Lucius He went on to become censor in 332 BC likely because of the legislation he passed whilst dictator in 339. As censor Philo enrolled newly subjugated Latins as citizens, specifically the tribes of Maecia and Scaptia as a means of legitimately uniting the newly conquered Latins into the Roman Republic. Later career In 327 BC Q. Publilius Philo was elected to the position of consul for a second time (the other consul in this year was L. Cornelius Lentulus). Philo and Lentulus were assigned commands to deal with troubles arising with the Greek colony of Palaeopolis, located near the ancient city of Nepolis.Livy.8.22. Publilius, after the Romans declared war on Palaeopolis, campaigned against them. Livy mentions that Publilius was permitted to remain in the field (he had gained a strategic position between Palaeopolis and Neapolis) despite his term as consul drawing to a close. The Senate permitted him to retain his command for the duration of the war as a proconsul, and nominated a dictator to hold elections in Rome whilst the two consuls were absent campaigning.Livy.8.22.23. Publilius's command lasted through until 326 BC where Livy tells us Liv.8.25.8 he successfully besieged and captured Palaeopolis via assistance from inside factions. The reason for the surrender of the city is given to be due to the local Greek inhabitants being mistreated, especially by the Samnites with whom they were allied and there was a Samnite force within the city. It was with the assistance of these local elements within the city that the Romans, led by Publilius, were able to gain entrance to the city. The elements within the city (according to Livy) further deceived the Samnite garrison into leaving the city on the pretext of having them raid the Roman coast. The Samnite force was thus outside of the city when the Romans were let in and the Samnites were routed back to their own lands without their armaments.Livy 8.26.5 For the feat of capturing the city and defeating the Samnites Publilius was awarded a triumph in Rome. Livy notes that the consulship of Publilius in 327 BC (and his command and triumph in 326 BC) marked two firsts for Rome; a consul having his command extended beyond his term (as proconsul) and he was the first to have been awarded a triumph after his normal command ceased (he celebrated his Triumph at the end of the war in 326 BC, in the year after his consulship of 327 BC). The next stage of Publilius's career, that we know of, arose in the year 320 BC with his election to the position of Consul (for the third time) alongside L. Papirius Cursor, to the universal appeal of the people of Rome (according to Livy).Livy 9.7.15 Publilius struck off his role as consul right away with discussions in the debate over the capitulation of the city of Caudium to the Samnites. After determining that the truce, which was forced on the Romans after the capitulation, was not valid because it was not decreed by the Roman people Publilius and Paprius took to the field with armies. Publilius stationed his forces in Samnium whilst Paprius marched on Leuceria.Livy 9.12. Publilius's position in Samnium threatened the Samnite forces in the region and reportedly provoked them to battle. In the engagement that followed Livy reports that Publilius's forces routed the Samnites and sacked their camp.Livy 9.13 From this victory Publilius joined his colleague Paprius at his position near Leuceria and succeeded in cutting off supplies to the city.Livy.9.13.11 The Samnites camped nearby Leuceria were provoked to battle by the Romans and defeated by the combined forces of the consuls Publilius and Paprius in a surprise attack following the Romans disregarding an ultimatum to cease hostilities sent by the city of Tarentum. The attack was so successful that the Romans were once again able to take and sack the Samnite camp.Livy.9.14 For the rest of the year of 320 BC Publilius campaigned in the Apulians and Livy tells us he was successful in capturing many towns and forming treaties with others. Whilst Publilius was thus occupied Paprius, who had been left to persecute the siege of Leuceria succeeded in taking the city and inflicted the same humiliating treatment on the captured Samnites as the Romans had endured with the capitulation of Cadmium (they were forced to ‚Äòpass under the yoke‚Äô).Livy 9.15 The final year that we have on record for Publilius's career is 315 when he was elected to the position of consul for the fourth time. Livy omits the names of the consuls for this year, but states that they remained in Rome whilst the current war against the Samnites and the city of Saticula was run by the dictator Aemilius. We have the names of the consuls from Diodorus Siculus who notes that the Consuls for the year were Lucius Papirus and Quintus Publilius (the same pairing as had occurred in 320 BC). Diodorus states that Publilius's consulship in this year was his second consulship, however our other sources show that it was his fourth time as consul. Evaluation Quintus Publilius Philo achieved a substantial amount across his career. Before anything he was a plebeian, something that despite his wealth and that of other wealthy plebeian families would have placed them at a disadvantage to the Roman patrician class. Despite this, Q. Publilius Philo was not only elected to a senatorial position in 352 BC, but was the first plebeian in Roman history to be elected to the position of consul in 339.Livy 8.12.4 This was enabled by the passing of the lex Genucia de feneratione in 342. The law restricted anyone from being appointed to more than one magisterial position at any one time, or within ten years of a previous appointment. Importantly, it required that at least one of the appointed Consuls every year to be a plebeian. It could be surmised that he was not only popular amongst the public and the aristocracy but was also influential. Having held arguably the highest position in Rome, it is no surprise that he then went on to ‚Äú[secure] the passage of three other laws believed to have been favourable to the plebs‚Äù; as well as to get himself elected to the position of Praetor 3 years later in 336: ‚ÄúIn this year also Q. Publilius Philo was elected as the first plebeian praetor against the opposition of the consul Sulpicius; the senate, after failing to keep the highest posts in their own hands, showed less interest in retaining the praetorship‚Äù.Livy 8.15.9 In the following year Philo goes on to be named magister equitum by the dictator L. Aemilius Mamercinus;Livy 8.16.12 a powerful position (essentially the ‚Äòlieutenant‚Äô of the dictator and holding similar levels of imperium to a Praetor). In 332 he plays the role of censor; in the years 327-326, however a truly significant step is taken by the senate. Philo received his second consulship, and waged war against Paleopolis and Neapolis, as the Roman people vote for war. He moves forward to aid the other consul that year and maintains a strategically vital position between two enemy cities. As 327 comes to an end, it is clear that Philo was maintaining a vital position for the war, and rather than have him return home and lose it, a new practice is introduced. For the first time, a Consul's power is extended beyond his term, and as the 326 begins Q. Publilus Philo is awarded the position of Pro-Consul. The first Roman to ever be awarded such a position. In being the first ever to attain the position of proconsul, Philo has once again made history. This demonstrates his significance as a political figure of the times and hints at his popularity among the people as well. Added to the honour of proconsulship he goes on to achieve a triumph for his victories in his term as proconsul; making him the first to gain a triumph post his year as consul, acto honore. The military and political honours achieved by Philo continued, with a 3rd consulship less than a decade later. Due to an emergency military situation requiring a proven general, he led an army against the Samnites and won multiple battles, potentially leading him to receive another triumph in 320 BC. Now this seems most interesting, as not only does the senate, which is full of patricians seem to ignore the Lex Genucia de feneratione for the 3 years prior to Philo's election to his first consulship ‚Äì as the law was passed in 342 BC and he was elected in 339 BC Livy 8.12 ‚Äì but once he is elected they seem to embrace him ‚Äì along with his skills no doubt ‚Äì with open arms, not only by honouring him numerous times and in a variety of ways, but also by seemingly ignoring the Lex Genucia yet again for his third election is 4 years sooner - as consulship was not to be awarded more than once within ten years to the same Roman - than it should have been legal. This is once again repeated five years later in 315 BC, when Philo is elected to his fourth consulship; it is debated that Philo potentially only had two consulships, as Diodorus claimed that 315 was but his second consulship, although it is not the leading theory.diod.19.66.1 During the term of his final consulship in 315 he seems to have stayed in Rome, whilst the Dictator, Q. Fabius waged war abroad. To consider the achievements of Q. Publilius Philo we must remember he is a trailblazer for the future political landscape and positions in Rome. He made history in being the first plebeian to hold the posts of both Consul and Praetor, and then the first Roman to have his imperium extended as proconsul, and the first to celebrate a triumph as a proconsul. He was honoured with the post of both dictator and being chosen as the master of horse under L. Aemilius Mamercinus. Livy tells us that he was a popular leader in both the laws he passed as dictator and in 320 BC when he was elected ‚Äòwith universal approval‚Äô after several other candidates had been rejected.Livy.9.7.15 Philo was an exceptional figure and his many achievements speak for themselves when we examine his significance as a political and military figure.

Background Gelobter grew up in Flatbush, Brooklyn and on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His father was a Polish Jew and his mother was a black Bermudan. He earned a B.S. degree in Conservation and Resource Studies in 1984, and then an M.S. and a Ph.D. in 1993, all from the University of California, Berkeley. His masters and doctoral research were about economic and racial inequality in the geographical distribution of air pollution.His dissertation was the first ever on environmental justice, and at Berkeley he taught the first classes ever offered in the field as well.University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability , \\"30 Years of Environmental Justice\\", January, 2020 Career After graduating, Gelobter worked for the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by John Dingell, and then served in the government of the City of New York under Mayor David Dinkins as Director of Environmental Quality. He then became founding Director of the Environmental Policy Program at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, where he was appointed an assistant professor.. See author titles. Next, he became a professor in the public administration department at Rutgers University. In 2001 he moved back to California and became executive director of an environmental think tank called Redefining Progress. As part of that organization he advocated for California to adopt strong regulation of greenhouse gases through market mechanisms, which contributed to the passing of the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. In 2007 he founded Cooler, a social venture that originally intended to launch a carbon offset credit card, and then offered two services ‚Äì one to consumers to provide carbon offsets for goods they bought online, and the other partnering with online retailers to help them source carbon neutral goods to sell, using a model to calculate the carbon footprint of the goods. He then joined Hara, a Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers-backed company that developed and sold environmental management systems, as its Chief Green Officer, and then co-founded BuildingEnergy.com, a cloud-based building energy management business. After that, he started to work with the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to develop prize-based methods to find solutions to address global warming in the developing world, and joined Infoedge, a management consulting firm, where he directed their energy and innovation practices. He is a member of the board of trustees of Ceres. He founded the Green Leadership Trust, served on the board of trustees of the Natural Resources Defense Council, and was a member of the advisory board of Al Gore's Alliance for Climate Protection. He has been a guest speaker at Singularity University, and spoke at the 2016 The Lean Startup Conference. He also lectures at the University of California, Berkeley. =Advocacy= Gelobter has urged others to start businesses in the clean technology sector, in order to create, develop, and validate successful business models. He argues that clean technology companies survive by providing services to companies in the rest of the economy, and if a clean technology company is making money, it does so by helping other kinds of companies make more money as well ‚Äì in other words, it uses sound environmental practices that are also economically sound and sustainable. Gelobter and eight other authors with an environmental justice perspective responded to the 2005 essay, The Death of Environmentalism: Global Warming Politics in a Post-Environmental World, by Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus ‚Äì which asserted that the environmental movement is unable to fully address climate change ‚Äì with the essay, The Soul of Environmentalism: Rediscovering transformational politics in the 21st century. They argued that Shellenberger and Nordhaus had adopted a framework (\\"death of\\") commonly used to introduce conservative thinking to new domains (\\"death of poetry\\", \\"death of history\\"), and that those authors had omitted the perspectives, frameworks, and history of the non-white poor. The essay pointed to how the environmental movement could be strengthened by allying with social justice and civil rights movements.

The Company is owned by 27 major not-for-profit Australian pension funds. IFM Investors‚Äô focus is on improving the retirement outcomes of more than 15 million workers globally represented by their investors. Headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, IFM Investors also has offices in a number of other countries. The company is chaired by former minister of the Australian Labor Party and ACTU secretary Greg Combet.  History  Established in 1990, the firm started off as the Development Australia Fund (DAF Limited). It was established to invest in growing Australian private and public companies and infrastructure assets. Its focus is to maximise investor returns and to challenge the profit-focused investment management model. In 1994, Industry Funds Services (IFS) was established to provide advice and specialist investment expertise in infrastructure, private equity and Australian equities. Industry Funds Management (IFM) was created through the merger of IFS Capital Group and DAF Limited in 2004 Industry Funds Management (IFM) changed its name to IFM Investors in 2013  Corporate responsibilities  IFM Investors has been a signatory to the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) since 2008 and has a Group Corporate Environmental, Social & Government Policy that determines its approach to the governance of investee entities  Sexual Harassment Lawsuit  In January 2019, IFM Investors and an Executive Director in their UK Infrastructure team, Frederic Michel-Verdier, were sued for sexual harassment, constructive dismissal and victimisation by a former associate Nathalie Abildgaard. = Allegations = Ms Abildgaard, 27 years old, claimed that Mr Michel-Verdier, 50 years old, said 'if I was 20 years younger, I would have been all over you' and that she should go his hotel room so \\"we could have fun\\" before sending her whatsapp messages including one with his hotel room number and a smiling emoji, while the pair were celebrating a business deal at a nightclub in Madrid. He was also said to have stood \\"inappropriately and intimidatingly\\" close to her and said: \\"You do not understand, I'm so much older than you. I know more about sex. I can teach you a lot of things.\\". In addition to the comments and text messages on the night at the club in Spain, Ms Abildgaard also alleges that Mr Michel-Verdier tried to call her twice in the early hours of March 17 and that he approached her on March 19 at work and said to her: \\"Good night out Friday, I was so drunk I missed my flight out on Saturday.\\" He is also said to have sent her a message on April 11 after her resignation saying: \\"Good luck for your new endeavour (now we can meet).\\". Ms Abildgaard's claims have been supported by copies of WhatsApp messages and witness statements from current and former IFM employees. As well as detailing harassment allegations against Mr Michel-Verdier during the tribunal hearings, Ms Abildgaard raised concerns over how IFM Investors had handled her allegations, claiming she was subjected to \\"retaliation\\" and \\"victimisation\\" after making a formal complaint. \\"I perceived IFM Investors to have an incentive to 'brush the whole thing under the carpet': it does not look good to investors (pension funds in particular) when a very senior member of staff is found to have behaved highly inappropriately towards several female employees for years (and the organisation has ignored several complaints for years) in particular when IFM brands itself as being pro-diversity and equality,\\" Ms Abildgaard said in statements provided to the tribunal. Ms Abildgaard alleged that IFM executives were aware of Mr Michel-Verdier's history of \\"questionable behaviour\\" including bullying and making sexist comments to women but did not take enough action to stop it. Witness statements were made in support of the bullying and sexism allegations. Ms Abildgaard sought compensation from IFM for her annual bonus of ¬£60,950 after claiming she was forced to leave IFM's London office earlier than planned following alleged harassment. She left IFM in April 2018 as a result of the sexual harassment. = Defense = Frederic Michel-Verdier, who is married, denied the allegations but was reprimanded by the firm for 'misuse of alcohol' over the incident. IFM's global head of people and culture Amelia McArdle said in her witness statement that Mr Michel-Verdier 'stated that he was stunned' and that 'he had no recollection of having sent messages, or the content of those messages,' that 'he explained that there had been a lot of drinking over the course of the evening ... and stated that while he may have made some bad jokes, he did not intend any wrongdoing.' IFM said it investigated the claims after the investment group was made aware of the complaint, and concluded that while Michel-Verdier sending his room number breached its code of conduct. Mr Michel-Verdier had his bonus cut and was banned from drinking at work events for 12 months, but the firm 'felt we could not reasonably conclude that there had also been verbal unwanted and physical advances.' IFM Investors and Mr Michel-Verdier defended the allegations, arguing in tribunal proceedings that Ms Abildgaard's claims were a \\"misconceived attempt to cause inconvenience, expense and embarrassment\\" and an attempt to force IFM into paying her substantial sums of money. Mr Michel-Verdier said \\"it was irresponsible and naive to have allowed myself as a senior employee at IFM to be put in the position where my actions could easily be twisted and misrepresented. = Settlement = In April 2019, before returning to court, IFM Investors paid Ms Abildgaard ¬£270,000 in financial settlement. The settlement exceeded Ms Abildgaard's original claim of ¬£236,000 and included a significant donation to Ms Abildgaard's charity Legal Aid for Business Diversity that she set up to help people who have faced discrimination at work. The settlement unusually contained no non-disclosure (\\"gagging\\") clause. Mr Michel-Verdier continued to work for IFM Investors, but left the company later in the year to \\"pursue personal business interest. His last day was August 30, 2019. It is unclear whether or not he reigned voluntarily or was asked to leave.

Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players, who start with minimal equipment and then must eliminate all other opponents while avoiding being trapped outside of a shrinking \\"safe area\\", with the winner being the last player or team alive. The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, itself based on the novel of the same name, which presents a similar theme of a last-man-standing competition in a shrinking play zone. The genre's origins arose from mods for large-scale online survival games like Minecraft and ARMA 2 in the early 2010s. By the end of the decade, the genre became a cultural phenomenon, with standalone games such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (2017), Fortnite Battle Royale (2017), Apex Legends (2019), and Call of Duty: Warzone (2020), each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases. Concept Map of the battle royale game thumb Battle royale games are played between many individual players, pairs of two players or a number of small squads (typically of 3-5 players). In each match, the goal is to be the last player or team standing by eliminating all other opponents. A match starts by placing the player-characters into a large map space, typically by having all players skydive from a large aircraft within a brief time limit. The map may have random distribution or allow players to have some control of where they start. All players start with minimal equipment, giving no player an implicit advantage at the onset. Equipment, usually used for combat, survival or transport is randomly scattered around the map, often at landmarks on the map, such as within buildings in ghost towns. Players need to search the map for these items while avoid being killed by other players, who cannot be visually marked or distinguishable either on-screen or on the map, requiring the player to solely use their own eyes and ears to deduce their positions. Equipment from eliminated players can usually be looted as well. These games often include some mechanic to push opponents closer together as the game progresses, usually taking the form of a gradually shrinking safe zone, with players outside of the zone eventually being killed. Typically, battle royale contestants are only given one life to play; any players who die are not allowed to respawn. Games with team support may allow players to enter a temporary, near-death state once health is depleted, giving allies the opportunity to revive them before they give out or are finished off by an opponent. The match is over when only one player or team remains, and the game typically provides some type of reward, such as in-game currency used for cosmetic items, to all players based on how long they survived. The random nature of starting point, item placement, and safe area reduction enables the battle royale genre to challenge players to think and react quickly and improve strategies throughout the match as to be the last man/team standing. In addition to standalone games, the battle royale concept may also be present as part of one of many game modes within a larger game, or may be applied as a user-created mod created for another game. There are various modifications that can be implemented atop the fundamentals of the battle royale. For example, Fortnite introduced a temporary mode in an event which is 50-versus-50 player mode in its Fortnite Battle Royale free-to-play game; players are assigned one of the two teams, and work with their teammates to collect resources and weapons towards constructing fortifications as the safe area of the game shrinks down, with the goal to eliminate all the players on the other team. History Formulative elements of the battle royale genre had existed prior the 2010s. Gameplay modes featuring last man standing rules has been a frequent staple of multiplayer online action games, though generally with fewer total players, as early as 1990's Bomberman, which introduced multiplayer game modes with players all starting with the same minimal abilities who collected power ups and fought until the last player was left standing. The elements of scavenging and surviving on a large open-world map were popularized through survival games. The 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, along with Koushun Takami's earlier 1999 novel of the same name and its 2000 manga adaptation, set out the basic rules of the genre, including players being forced to kill each other until there is a single survivor, taking place on a shrinking map, and the need to scavenge for weapons and items. It soon inspired a wave of battle royale themed Japanese manga and anime, such as Gantz (2000), Future Diary (2006), and Btooom! (2009), and then the battle royale formula eventually appeared in The Hunger Games franchise. Fictional battle royale video games were depicted in Btooom, and in the Phantom Bullet (Gun Gale Online) arc of the light novel series Sword Art Online (2010) as the \\"Bullet of Bullets\\" tournament. Initial attempts at adapting the Battle Royale formula into video games came in the form of Japanese visual novel games that focused on storytelling and puzzle-solving, such as Higurashi: When They Cry (2002), Zero Escape (2009) and Danganronpa (2010). However, these visual novel games are distinct from the genre that what would later be known as battle royale games, which emerged when Western developers later adapted the Battle Royale formula into a shooter game format. =Early mods and games (2012‚Äì2016)= Shortly after the release of the 2012 film The Hunger Games, which had a similar premise to the earlier film Battle Royale, a server plug-in named Hunger Games (later changed to Survival Games) was developed for Minecraft. Survival Games takes inspiration from the film, initially placing players at the center of the map near a set of equipment chests. When the game commences, players can compete over the central resources or spread out to find items stored in chests scattered around the play area. Players killed are eliminated and the last surviving player wins the match. In DayZ, a mod for ARMA 2, released in August 2012, players struggle alongside or against each other to obtain basic necessities to continue living in a persistent sandbox filled with various dangers. These games were designed to include player versus player encounters, but generally these events were infrequent due to the size of the game's map and the persistence of the game world. This led to the development of game mods that sacrificed ARMA 2/DayZ open-endedness in favor of focusing on more frequent hostile interactions between players to determine an eventual winner. The most influential battle royale mod was created by Brendan Greene, known by his online alias \\"PlayerUnknown\\", whose Battle Royale mod for ARMA 2 and DayZ first released in 2013. This mod was directly inspired by Battle Royale. In contrast to Hunger Games-inspired mods, Greene's mod randomly scattered weapons around the map instead of from a central repository. Greene updated this mode for ARMA 3 when the DayZ team opted to release their game as a standalone game. Greene continued to adopt his format as a consultant for H1Z1: King of the Kill before becoming the creative developer at Bluehole of a standalone game representing his vision of the battle royale genre, which would later be released as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Games from other developers took inspiration from highly played battle royale-style mods, as well as the popularity of The Hunger Games film series. Ark: Survival Evolved by Studio Wildcard introduced its \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" mode in July 2015, which was geared to be used for eSports tournaments. The mode was temporarily broken off as its own free-to-play game during 2016 before the developers opted to merge it back into the main game for ease of maintenance of the overall game. In 2016, a battle royale mobile game, Btooom Online, based on the 2009 manga Btooom, was developed and released in Japan. Despite some initial success on the Japanese mobile charts, Btooom Online was ultimately a commercial failure in Japan. =Formation of standalone games (2017‚Äì2018)= While formative elements of the battle royale genre had been established before 2017, the genre was defined and grew out from two principal titles through 2017 and 2018: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, which soon inspired Fortnite Battle Royale. Both games drew tens of millions of players in short periods of time, proving them as commercial successes and leading to future growth after 2018. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was created by Brendan Greene, its title based on his online alias \\"PlayerUnknown\\". The game was based on his previous Battle Royale mod for ARMA 2 and DayZ first released in 2013. Building on his earlier work, Greene went to work at Bluehole in South Korea, becoming the creative developer of a standalone game representing his vision of the battle royale genre, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. While Battlegrounds was not the first battle royale game, its release to early access in March 2017 drew a great deal of attention, selling over twenty million copies by the end of the year, and is considered the defining game of the genre. In September 2017, the game broke the previous record for highest number of concurrent players on Steam, with over 1.3 million users playing the game simultaneously. Battlegrounds explosive growth and how it established the battle royale genre was considered one of the top trends in the video game industry in 2017. Battlegrounds popularity created a new interest in the battle royale genre. Numerous games that copied the fundamental gameplay of Battlegrounds appeared in China, shortly after Battlegrounds release. Epic Games had released Fortnite, a cooperative survival game, into early access near the release of Battlegrounds. Epic saw the potential to create their own battle royale mode, and by September 2017, released the free-to-play Fortnite Battle Royale which combined some of the survival elements and mechanics from the main Fortnite game with the Battle Royale gameplay concept. The game saw similar player counts as Battlegrounds, with twenty million unique players reported by Epic Games by November 2017. Bluehole expressed concern at this move, less due to being a clone of Battlegrounds, but more so that they had been working with Epic Games for technical support of the Unreal Engine in Battlegrounds, and thus they were worried that Fortnite may be able to include planned features to their battle royale mode before they could release those in Battlegrounds. Battleground developer, PUBG Corporation, filed a lawsuit against Epic in South Korea in January 2018 claiming Fortnite Battle Royale infringements on Battlegrounds copyrights. Market observers predicted that there would be little likelihood of Bluehole winning the case, as it would be difficult to establish the originality of PUBG in court due to itself being derived from Battle Royale. By the end of June 2018, the lawsuit had been closed by PUBG, under undisclosed reasons. In 2018, Fortnite Battle Royale rivaled Battlegrounds in player numbers and surpassed it in revenue, which was attributed to its free-to-play business model and cross-platform support, as well as its accessibility to casual players. Battlegrounds creator Brendan Greene credited it with further growing the battle royale genre. Its mainstream publicity further increased following a stream by Tyler \\"Ninja\\" Blevins with Drake, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Travis Scott. which set a Twitch record for concurrent viewership. It accumulated a total playerbase of 45 million in January and 3.4 million concurrent players in February. Polygon labeled it \\"the biggest game of 2018\\" and \\"a genuine cultural phenomenon\\", with \\"everyone from NFL players to famous actors\\" playing it, including Red Sox player Xander Bogaerts and Bayern Munich's youth team borrowing celebrations from the game. In Asia, however, PUBG remains the most popular battle royale game. Other popular battle royale games released in 2017, inspired by the success of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, include two NetEase titles, Rules of Survival and mobile game Knives Out, and the mobile game Garena Free Fire by Garena. Each of these games have received hundreds of millions of players, mostly in Asia, by 2018. = Mainstream popularity (2018‚Äìpresent) = With the success of Battlegrounds and Fortnite, the battle royale genre expanded greatly. Major publishers, including Electronic Arts Activision, and Ubisoft acknowledged the impact of the growing genre and impact on their future plans. Activision's Call of Duty series features a battle royale mode titled Blackout in its 2018 installment, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, as does EA's Battlefield V. Other established games added battle royale-inspired gamemodes in updates, such as Grand Theft Auto Online, Paladins, Dota 2, Battlerite, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. In February 2019, EA released the free-to-play Apex Legends, which exceeded 50 million player accounts within a month. The second main battle royale installment in the Call of Duty franchise, titled Call of Duty: Warzone, was released in March 2020, as a part of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare video game but does not require purchase of it; the game reached more than 50 million players in its first month of release. The battle royale approach has also been used in games from genres not normally associated with shooter games. Tetris 99 is a 2019 game released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch that has 99 players simultaneously competing in a game of Tetris. Players can direct \\"attacks\\" on other players for each line they complete, attempting to remain the last player standing. Blizzard Entertainment added a battle royale- inspired \\"Battlegrounds\\" mode to its digital card game Hearthstone, where eight players vie to win over the others through several rounds of drafting new cards and fighting in one-on-one events. The racing game Forza Horizon 4 from Playground Games added a battle royale mode called \\"The Eliminator\\" where players all start with the same car, but can gain upgrades by beating other players and discovering \\"drops\\" around the map. dozens of battle royale games have debuted but, similar to the MOBA genre, only two or three titles have maintained mainstream popularity at the same time. Other games and battle royale modes had briefly become popular before their concurrent player count dropped and players returned to Fortnite or Battlegrounds; Apex Legends was the year's only new successful battle royale game. In contrast to other multiplayer-only games, the large number of players typically involved in battle royale games generally require a large enough concurrent player base for matchmaking in a reasonable amount of time. The Culling, by Xaviant Studios, was released in early access in 2016, and was designed to be a streaming-friendly battle royale mode for 16 players. However, following the release of Battlegrounds, The Culling lost much of its player base, and a few months after releasing the full version of the game, Xaviant announced they were ending further development on it to move onto other projects. Radical Heights by Boss Key Productions was launched in April 2018 but within two weeks had lost 80% of its player base. SOS, a battle royale game released by Outpost Games in December 2017, had its player counts drop into the double- digits by May 2018, leading Outpost to announce the game's closure by November 2018. While several major battle royale announcements occurred at E3 in 2018, only Fallout 76s battle royale mode appeared at the trade show in 2019. The Chinese government, through its Audio and Video and Numeral Publishing Association, stated in October 2017 that it will discourage its citizens from playing battle royale games as they deem them too violent, which \\"deviates from the values of socialism and is deemed harmful to young consumers\\", as translated by Bloomberg. Gaming publications in the west speculated that this would make it difficult or impossible to publish battle royale within the country. In November 2017, PUBG Corporation announced its partnership with Tencent to publish the game in China, making some changes in the game to \\"make sure they accord with socialist core values, Chinese traditional culture and moral rules\\" to satisfy Chinese regulations and censors. However, during mid-2018, the Chinese government revamped how it reviewed and classified games that are to be published in China, and by December 2018, after the formation of the new Online Ethics Review Committee, several battle royale titles, including Fortnite and PUBG, were listed as prohibited or must be withdrawn from play. Despite the concern that PUBG Corporation and Tencent were taking with Chinese release, many clones of Battlegrounds have been released in China, and created a new genre called \\"chicken-eating game\\", named based on the congratulatory line to the last player standing in Battlegrounds, \\"Winner winner chicken dinner!\\" Impact The rapid growth and success of the battle royale genre has been attributed to several factors, including the way all players start in the same vulnerable state and eliminating any intrinsic advantage for players, and being well-suited for being a spectator eSport. Other factors including specific games' business models, such as Fortnite Battle Royale being free and available across computers, consoles, and mobile devices. A University of Utah professor also considers that battle royale games realize elements of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, a scheme to describe human motivation, more-so than video games have in the past. While the lowest tiers of Maslow's hierarchy, physiological and safety, are met by the survival elements of battle royales, the love/belonging and esteem tiers are a result of the battle royale being necessarily a social and competitive game, and the final tier of self-actualization comes from becoming skilled in the game to win frequently. Business Insider projected that battle royale games would bring in over during 2018, and would grow to in 2019. SuperData Research reported that, in 2018, the three top-grossing battle royale games (Fortnite, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Call of Duty: Black Ops 4) generated nearly in combined digital revenue. Sensor Tower reported that 2018's top three most- downloaded mobile battle royale games (PUBG Mobile, Garena Free Fire and Fortnite) received over 500million downloads combined that year. The most- played battle royale games include PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds with 600million players, Fortnite Battle Royale with 350million players, NetEase's mobile game Knives Out with over 250million players, Rules of Survival with 230million players, and Garena Free Fire with over 180million players. Turtle Beach Corporation, a manufacturer of headphones and microphones for gaming, reported an increase of over 200% in net revenues for the second quarter of 2018 over the same quarter in 2017, which they attributed to the popularity of the battle royale genre.

It was then where the Westminster style of democracy was introduced that was prevalent in Britain at the time. Since Bangladesh achieved its independence on 26 March 1971 from Pakistan; Bangladesh introduced parliamentary democracy into its political system, however, a military coup in 1975 halted the process. History Bangladesh achieved sovereignty from Pakistan in 1971, a country established with a democratic framework. As a result, Bangladesh was also established with democratic institutions at its core. Bangladesh's first leaders came from the Awami League party, a party which played a pivotal role in the campaign for a separate Bengali state. The Awami League party oversaw the implementation of a parliamentary system of democracy as stated in the Provisional Constitution of Order of 1972. Soon after, the 1972 constitution was passed by the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1972. After the initial years of democracy, Bangladesh experienced two decades worth of authoritarian rules which included stints of military regimes. The country experienced military coups in 1975; when the military used corruption and bad ruling to justify the takeover and later on General Ziaur Rehman was elected as president in 1977, and in 1982; where a martial law was announced by General H.M. Ershad after a coup to overthrow the previous regime held by General Ziaur Rehman. Bangladesh then started to transition to parliamentary democracy again in 1991, however, a political crises in 2007 saw the country under a state of emergency, whereby, a 'military backed' caretaker government was installed until the leader of the Awami League party, Sheikh Hasina, became prime minister in the 2009 elections.  Military and Democracy  The political system of Bangladesh allowed the military to become increasingly involved in the political framework of the country. Since the re-emergence of parliamentary democracy in 1991, the existence of the two major political parties (Awami League and the Bangladesh National Party) - which held two polarising ideologies - allowed civilian unrest to grow as two ideologically different camps were established, causing a high polarisation of the country. The struggle between the Awami League and the Bangladesh National Party made civilians become partisan. Along with civilian polarisation, institutions were also affected by the animosity between the two political parties as civilian institutions were continually polarised and politicised; including the army. The army initially grew fearful of instating civilian control as people would often regard the army to be playing partisan politics. As a result, both the civilians and the armed forces were less interested in instituting a civilian democracy. This resulted in substantial amount of civilian unrest, such as that seen in 2007, and because of which soldiers were increasingly drawn to intervene in politics to supposedly safeguard Bangladesh's democracy. During the post 2009 era, laws similar to the one's established in the democratic era of 1991 to 2006 had been instated which ensured more civilian control over the armed forces. A civilian elected prime minister became the head of state once again. Although former military officers remained in some political parties, the military did not possess any authority in the leadership of the parties as the parties became increasingly dynastic-ally operated. Civilian governments also tended to reduce the influence of the military in politics and took steps to allow more civilian institutional control of the military. However, in the political era after the 2009 era, it was seen that the military consistently favoured the ruling party in the government.  Democratic Values  Although Bangladesh has been under authoritarian regimes, it has been a democratic entity for a majority of the time since the country's foundation. The state of democracy can be judged by looking at the violations of the core principles of democracy as laid out by the United Nations. = Freedom of expression and association = Bangladesh has suffered from assaults on university students - who are regarded as the pioneers of grassroots movements in the past - in order to change their political opinions. After the 2019 elections were held, reports of vote rigging emerged which sparked protests by the Left Democratic Alliance. However, cases of police brutality and assaults on protesters were seen, as at least 50 activists were left with serious injuries. In September 2018, the Bangladeshi government introduced the Digital Security Act. However, some laws in the act criminalised the freedom of expression as several cases of civilians being charged were revealed for posting anti-government comments online. In 2019, Bangladesh ranked 44 out of 100 in net freedom, with 0 out of 100 representing extremely limited net freedom. = Free and independent media = Journalism in Bangladesh has been under immense pressure as evident in the rankings of the country in the World Press Freedom Index. Bangladesh stood at 144 out of 180 countries in 2016, and the rankings only slipped as Bangladesh received 146 in 2018, 150 in 2019, and 151 in 2019. Amnesty International reported that the main hindrance to free journalism is that several media outlets in Bangladesh are affected by owners and political influence, which hinders the diversification of opinions. In 2016, some reporters argued that Bangladesh's press freedom had never been more restricted since the country's return to civilian rule in 1991. Amnesty International also revealed that the press is often intimidated by threats of physical violence and criminal cases against journalists. In 2011, the restrictions on press freedom drew international criticism after the then US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton voiced her concern on the state of the freedom of press in the country. Voters standing in queue to cast their votes = Free and fair elections = Bangladesh elections in 2014 were marred with allegations of irregularities, such as voter suppression, fake votes and capturing of pooling booths. The Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and its allies boycotted the 2014 elections as their demands of a caretaker government in place to oversee the elections were not met. This resulted in the Awami League to win the general election even as 153 out of the 300 parliamentary seats went uncontested. According to electoral agencies, only 10% of the eligible population cast their ballot in the 2014 general elections. Furthermore, leading up to the 2018 general elections, the opposition parties questioned the Election Commission (EC) on their neutrality as they believed them to be increasingly one-sided towards the ruling party. Media coverage and reports from human rights organisations revealed the Awami League's elaborate plan for voter suppression and arrests of opposition activists in the lead up to the 2018 general election. The ruling party and its allies won 288 out of the 300 parliamentary seats, which raised serious concerns over the legitimacy of the election held as previous election held by the caretaker governments from 1991 to 2008 usually resulted in less than 48% of the seats going to the election winner. = Independence of judiciary = The constitution of Bangladesh allows the President to appoint the Chief Justice of Bangladesh after receiving advice from the Prime Minister. Concerns of politically motivated court cases have continually emerged, and concerns regarding the politically appointed judiciary favouring the concurrent government is a contested debate in Bangladesh. In 2010, 6788 out of the 10,489 cases reviewed by a committee relating to the ruling party were dropped as the law ministry suggested that the cases were 'politically motivated'. The lower and higher courts have faced multiple allegations of corruption and bribery. Several ruling party members who had allegedly been involved in land grabbing scandals and corruption were not held 'accountable' in 2010. = Transparency and accountability in public administration = Using positions of power to grant favours to relatives, supporters and friends is considered a norm in Bangladeshi politics. Most leaders of Bangladesh have been alleged into being involved in large corruption scandals either directly or indirectly. = Respect for human rights and freedom = Violations of human rights in Bangladesh take the forms of extra-judicial killings and custodial torture and deaths. An estimated of 154 extra judicial killings in 2009 and another 127 deaths were confirmed through extra-judicial in 2010, with larger numbers expected. Although local laws prohibit physical violence or mental torture of detainees and prisoners by state agencies, these laws were routinely broken, and in certain cases, the victims would effectively 'disappear'. From 2007 to 2008, several top businessmen and politicians were subjected to trials for charges such as financial corruption, tax evasion and bribery. Several of the top political leaders were then subject to mental and physical torture during detention. Cases such as those of police brutality in early 2019 were evident, as police used force to disperse 50,000 protestors, resulting in one death and over 50 injuries.  Quality of Democracy  Bangladesh had a large voter turnout in 2009 and 2018 of 80%. However, the differentiation in political ideas for civilians to vote on became limited due to high barriers of entry requiring large amounts of resources, which left only a small segment of the population having the ability to run political campaigns. A small segment of the political class divided among the existing political parties left few new policy alternatives being presented to the public. After the elections, only a few procedures for accountability were available to the public for the elected officials. After election, members of parliament (MP) often indulged in being 'gatekeepers' of party policies in their constituency rather than serving their voters' interest. Voters often felt that their elected MPs either never visited their constituencies or visited infrequently. The same voters also felt that the interaction between MPs and their constituents is crucial for positive engagement and to monitor their performances in the parliament. In another survey of MPs, only 35 of the elected officials believed that they were being held accountable to their constituents. The members of parliament were also often unaware of all of the problems in their constituencies, due to a law permitting members of parliament to represent constituencies they are not from. Members of parliament may also be unaware of critical issues in their constituencies as they are based in Dhaka, rather than within their community. Political parties in Bangladesh are also often structured in a way that the party leadership remains dynastic. As a result, the children of political leaders are expected to be future party leaders. Rare changes in party leadership reduced the ability of younger party members to gain higher ranking positions, which also reduced diversification and differentiation of party policies. Article 70 of the constitution also prevented members of a party to vote against a policy brought forth by other party members of the same party. This also reduced the ability of parliament members on their ability to vote in the interest of their constituents, having been forced to vote in the interests of the party.

Guest editors‚Äô introduction: Cross-reality environments. IEEE Pervasive Computing 8, 3 (2009). It encompasses a wide spectrum of hardware and software, including sensory interfaces, applications, and infrastructures, that enable content creation for virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), cinematic reality (CR). With these tools, users generate new forms of reality by bringing digital objects into the physical world and bringing physical world objects into the digital world. Its meaning has more recently been broadened to include technologies of extended (\\"cyborg\\" or wearable) intelligenceAll Reality: Values, taxonomy, and continuum, for Virtual, Augmented, eXtended/MiXed (X), Mediated (X,Y), and Multimediated Reality/Intelligence Steve Mann, John C. Havens, Jay Iorio, Yu Yuan, and Tom Furness, AWE, Santa Clara, May 31, 2018 in regards to the IEEE Council on Extended Intelligence (CXI). \\"XR\\" is a far-reaching, inclusive, and flexible term. The \\"X\\" represents a variable that defines a continuum that can also be expanded and extended in a multivariate sense (e.g. \\"XYR\\" = XY Reality). XR technologies have applications in almost every industry, such as: architecture, automotive industry, sports training, real estate, mental health, medicine, health care, retail, space travel, design, engineering, interior design, television and film, media, advertising, marketing, libraries, education, news, music, and travel.  Background  Drawing from media studies and philosophy, the concept of XR is related to a variety of theories about virtuality, computer vision, machine learning, and the increasingly collaborative relationship between human and machine. Our growing ability to see like digital devices results in a world that blurs the digital and the biological. XR can be viewed as a manifestation of \\"The New Aesthetic\\", the term coined by James Bridle that references \\"the increasing appearance of the visual language of digital technology and the Internet in the physical world, and the blending of virtual and physical\\". Closely related to Gilles Deleuze's concept of virtuality, XR positions \\"virtual\\" as not opposed to \\"real\\". Within the framework of XR, virtuality is not the opposite of reality and digital is not the opposite of biological. Rather, XR envisions a more complex relationship in which virtuality actualizes real effects to the extent that our perception of virtual objects becomes fully real. This explains why virtual reality can treat phobias.  History of the XR, X-Reality, and Cross-Reality terminology  The terms \\"X-Reality\\" and \\"XR\\" have a long history from the 1960s (Wyckoff), the 1990s (Mann and Wyckoff for computerized eyeglass-based mediated reality), and the 2000s (Coleman, Paradisio and Landay who also introduced the term \\"Cross Reality\\"), and the term \\"XR\\" has appeared in multiple trademark registrations submitted to the US Patent & Trademark office by the Sony Corporation beginning as early as 1988 (though Sony does not hold a trademark for the standalone, two letter term \\"XR\\").Mann, Steve, Tom Furness, Yu Yuan, Jay Iorio, and Zixin Wang. \\"All Reality: Virtual, Augmented, Mixed (X), Mediated (X, Y), and Multimediated Reality.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.08386 (2018). Headsets that enable VR and MR experiences, such as the Windows 10 MR devices, have been referred to as \\"XR devices\\". In May 2016, Pixvana referred to XR as an umbrella term for virtual, mixed, and augmented reality. An arts program called SIFFX at the Seattle International Festival used \\"X\\" to describe the \\"radical unknown\\" of VR, AR and 360 content in June 2016. SIXR, a Seattle-based collective of artists, refers to XR in their mission in order to encourage creators to work across the AR/MR/VR/360 spectrum. In February 2017 at GDC, Unity announced they are developing an XR Foundation Toolkit for AR/VR creators. Also that month, The Khronos Group formed a working group of key industry leaders from Oculus, Valve, Unity, Epic, Samsung, and Google to form the OpenXR initiative: \\"a cross-platform VR standard eliminates industry fragmentation by enabling applications to be written once to run on any VR system, and to access VR devices integrated into those VR systems to be used by applications\\". The working group has named the initiative OpenXR in order to include standards for VR and AR applications and devices. A podcast interview with Valve's Joe Ludwig on Voices of VR cites XR as \\"one of the most significant collaborations across the entire VR industry\\". The \\"Women in XR\\" initiative was announced at VRLA April 2017. In May 2017, an article defining XR written by S. Somasegar and Linda Lian appeared in TechCrunch. The term 'XR' was liberally used by VR pioneers, Upload, in their blog announcement to the XR industry on March 16, 2018, advising that they were closing their San Francisco and Los Angeles facilities to focus on their education and media services \\"to the XR community\\".\\" Commentary on the terms 'XR' and 'cross reality' were further defined, in the VR Focus article by Editor-in-Chief Kevin Joyce which states: \\"A new emerging trend is to define any content using these emerging technologies as ‚ÄòXR‚Äô. However, XR is also used to define ‚Äòcross reality‚Äô, which is any hardware that combines aspects of AR, MR and VR; such as Google Tango.\\"  References  Category:Virtual reality Category:Augmented reality Category:Mixed reality Category:Reality by type Category:New media Category:User interfaces Category:User interface techniques Category:Mass media theories ","title":"X Reality (XR)"},{"id":"53963642","text":"The Guest Book is an American anthology comedy television series created by Greg Garcia.

The series premiered on TBS on August 3, 2017. On September 13, 2017, TBS renewed it for a second season, which premiered on October 23, 2018. Garcia tweeted on September 12, 2019 that TBS had cancelled the series.

Episodes The intended fifth episode of the series was originally intended to air on August 24, 2017, but was held back as it \\"contained elements that were deemed too sensitive\\" at that point in time. At the end of August 2017, Garcia noted on Twitter that the held episode would not be made available \\"for awhile\\", and that he hopes that it will be released at a later date. In mid-September, Garcia again posted on Twitter and confirmed that the episode would air the next Thursday as the eighth episode of the season, albeit in an edited form to fit its new place in the show's continuity. When the episode aired, the sensitive elements were revealed to be in relation to the Unite the Right rally which took place two weeks before the episode was originally due to air. The episode depicted an Alzheimer's patient regaining his spousal abuse tendencies and racist personality - going as far as sewing and wearing a KKK outfit with the intention of attending a rally, while also revealing he once murdered an African American while burning down a local black church. =Season 1 (2017)= =Season 2 (2018)= Reception =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 64% based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 6.33 out of 10.

Wisconsin, 881 N.W.2d 749 (Wis. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S.Ct. 2290 (2017), was a Wisconsin Supreme Court case that was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The case challenged the State of Wisconsin's use of closed-source risk assessment software in the sentencing of Eric Loomis to six years in prison. The case alleged that using such software in sentencing violates the defendant's right to due process because it prevents the defendant from challenging the scientific validity and accuracy of such test. The case also alleged that the system in question (COMPAS) violates due process rights by taking gender and race into account. Hearing this case would have given the court \\"the opportunity to rule on whether it violates due process to sentence someone based on a risk-assessment instrument whose workings are protected as a trade secret.\\" The Supreme Court denied the writ of certiorari, thus declining to hear the case, on June 26, 2017. Background In February 2013, Eric Loomis was found driving a car that had been used in a shooting. He was arrested, and pleaded guilty to eluding an officer.https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/equivant- compas-algorithm/550646/ In determining his sentence, the judge looked at his criminal record as well as a score assigned by a tool called COMPAS.Robin A.

COMPAS classified Loomis as high-risk of re-offending, and Loomis was sentenced to six years. He appealed the ruling on the grounds that the judge, in considering the outcome of an algorithm whose inner workings were secretive and could not be examined, violated due process.

It is now a Roman Catholic titular see.  History  Castra Galbae, apparently named after a member of the Galba family (including an ephemerous general- emperor), was among the towns, important enough in the Roman province of Numidia (in the papal sway) to become a suffragan diocese. Its only historically documented bishop, Lucius, took part in the Council of Carthage called in 256 by Saint Cyprian, bishop of Carthage), concerning the lapsi, 'fallen' Christians who accepted forced pagan sacrifices to avoid martyrdom. The bishopric faded, plausibly during the 7th century advent of Islam, but the town persisted in modern Algeria, under the Arabic equivalent of its ancient name: Kasr-Galaba (kasr also meaning fortified place).

The Made in the EU label indicates the product is mainly made in the European Union. Significance The EU is one of the world‚Äôs biggest markets with half a billion consumers. Professor Jerzy Buzek, past chair of the European Parliament Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), said that \\"'Made in Europe' means we are proud of our activity.\\" The benefits of a 'Made in Europe' tag would be that it highlights the positive effects of European regulations, which make products safer and less damaging to the environment. Quality Carlos Moedas, EU Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation, says that Europe needs to show a clear benefit to citizens and businesspeople, and that 'Made in Europe' could help by demonstrating the quality of European products. ‚ÄòIf we want people to believe in the European project, we have to be the best, or nothing,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòThat is our bet, the \\"Made in Europe\\" label continues to be seen as a guarantee of quality, whether we are talking about steam engines or shoes.‚Äô Economy European products stamped with a ‚ÄòMade in Europe‚Äô stimulate growth in the EU. A \\"Made in Europe\\" label is not only a commercial label but also a signature that social and environmental issues are respected. The need for the label comes as the EU works to increase its competitiveness against the US and China. Regulation Made in the EU is not obligatory as an indication for European products instead of the country designation, but intended as a replacement in the long run. Members of European Parliament proposed that the European Commission has a public EU-wide blacklist of firms which are found to intentionally infringe EU product safety rules. They also want penalties to be \\"proportionate and dissuasive\\" and to take account of the seriousness, duration and intentionality of the infringement as well as the size of the company. History The first attempt to regulate the marking of origin of products at EU-level was with the 2005 proposal for a Regulation on the indication of origin of certain products. The \\"made in\\" proposal was launched under the European Single Market Act, of which has been repeatedly advocated by the European Council. Views on the proposal remain divided in the Council, with Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands reportedly being against it while France and Italy support the mandatory marking.

It has a rosette of leaves at its base and up to seven relatively large, translucent flowers with green and brown marking with a brown to green insect- like labellum with bristly hairs. It occurs in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria although in the latter state it has been separated into three species and is also under review in New South Wales. Description Pterostylis biseta, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a rosette of between six and fourteen leaves at the base of the flowering spike, each leaf long and wide. The leaves are often withered by the time of flowering. Up to seven translucent green and brown flowers long and wide are borne on a flowering spike tall. Two to six papery bracts are wrapped around the flowering spike. The dorsal sepal and petals are joined to form a hood called the \\"galea\\" over the column with the dorsal sepal having a thread-like tip long. The lateral sepals are wider than the galea, dished, densely hairy on their outer edges and suddenly taper to a thread-like tip. The lateral sepals are more or less parallel to each other and the tips are long. The labellum is brown to green, thin and insect-like, long and about wide. The \\"head\\" end is swollen with two long bristles and there are up to 34 shorter bristles on the side. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming The bristly rustyhood was first formally described in 1968 by John Blackmore and Stephen Clemesha from a specimen collected near Blackwood and the description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (biseta) is derived from the Latin prefix bi- meaning \\"two\\" and the word seta meaning \\"bristle\\". The taxonomy of this species is under review. The National Herbarium of Victoria has split the species into Pterostylis despectans, P. planulata and P. sp. aff. biseta (Pink Lakes). The National Herbarium of New South Wales reports that the species is \\"under review\\". Distribution and habitat Pterostylis biseta as currently described by the National Herbarium of New South Wales, occurs in that state south from Hillston, in northern Victoria and in the south-east of South Australia. It grows in sparse forest, often on rocky ridges, and in arid scrubland.

It is a gazetted beach, meaning it is managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, which provides lifeguards during the summer months. The beach is about 200 metres in length, and is located beside the smaller Casam Beach (). It sits beside the northern abutment of the Ting Kau Bridge, and also offers views of the Tsing Ma Bridge. History A two-storey beach building, housing changing rooms and other facilities, opened at Lido Beach on 1 May 1982. It was built at the same time as the beach building at Kadoorie Beach. There was a landslide above the beach on 2 July 1997. Eight people, including two patrolling lifeguards, were buried in mud. They survived with injuries. Amid the backdrop of several shark attacks, the Regional Council moved in 1995 to install shark nets at certain beaches. On 7 July 1995 the council decided to extend the shark net programme to Lido Beach, Butterfly Beach, and Tung Wan in Cheung Chau. Two volleyball courts were set up at the beach in July 2003. Facilities * Beach volleyball courts * Changing rooms and showers * Toilets * Tuck shop Water quality In early 2003, Lido Beach (along with three other nearby beaches) was closed because the water quality had worsened following the commissioning of Stage 1 of the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS). While HATS Stage 1 overall improved water quality in Victoria Harbour, it worsened conditions in the western area of the harbour because of the large quantity of non-disinfected effluent being released from the Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works. Despite the closure of the beach, public patronage remained high, with attendance of about 41,071 from March to October 2003. The Public Accounts Committee of the Legislative Council expressed their \\"grave concern\\" over the situation, given the health hazard the water quality posed to swimmers, and urged the government to expedite measures to disinfect the effluent from the sewage treatment plant. Permanent disinfection facilities were built at Stonecutters Island under HATS Stage 2, and water quality subsequently improved. Lido Beach was officially reopened to swimmers on 15 June 2011, and lifeguards are provided there once again.

The Catholic idea of Limbo is often cited as a theologoumenon. Once a widespread concept, it is no longer usually taught in Catholic pedagogy, and has generally been abandoned since the Second Vatican Council. Pope Benedict XVI referred to it as a \\"theological hypothesis\\" and expressed doubts about its accuracy. A theologoumenon is a theological statement or concept that lacks absolute doctrinal authority. It is commonly defined as \\"a theological assertion or statement not derived from divine revelation\\", or \\"a theological statement or concept in the area of individual opinion rather than of authoritative doctrine\\". Theologoumenon comes from an ancient Greek word that means ‚Äúsomething that is theologised‚Äù or ‚Äúthat which is said about God or divine things‚Äù . Understandings =Catholicism= In Roman Catholic theology, it usually refers to statements that are without direct confirmation in Scripture or official endorsement by the divinely inspired Teaching Magisterium of the Church, and are therefore not dogmatically binding per se, but are worth recommending because they cast light on understanding doctrines that are considered to be divinely revealed. =Orthodoxy= In Orthodox theology, the term has a roughly similar meaning. The Orthodox Church in America defines theologoumena as acceptably orthodox \\"theological opinions\\" that can develop into \\"pious traditions\\", but which nevertheless can be erroneous or imperfect. A more comprehensive Orthodox definition is often given as \\"the theological opinion of one or many of the holy fathers of the undivided Church.\\" \\"The content of the theologumena,\\" according to Bulgarian theologian Stefan Zankow, \\"is probable truth.\\" In Zankow's words, \\"the number of the fathers who accept a given viewpoint of this nature has no significance as to its validity; still, the greater the number who defend such a statement, the greater probability of its truth.\\" Other Orthodox thinkers often formulate the concept in a similar way. There is some disagreement between Orthodox and Catholic theologians as to which theological concepts are divinely revealed doctrines and which are simply theologoumena. =Elsewhere= A theologoumenon is a theological statement which cannot be directly regarded as the official teaching of the Church, as truth binding in faith. It is the outcome and communication of an endeavour to understand the faith by establishing connections between binding doctrines of faith by challenging dogmatic teachings with the whole of secular experience and all a man or an age knows. Karl Rahner proposes that such an arrangement need not necessarily greatly differ from one, which is actually of faith. He suggests that it can be enclosed in a truth of faith as a means to understanding that faith. Adding to this Rahner goes on to say that these theologumena are completely necessary for theology in the understanding of the faith. Revelation does not compose of all knowledge of reality in its origin and a person in his cognisance cannot understand, to assimilate something that bears no relation to his own knowledge. What is revealed can only be truly known and personally understood in a gathering of man's secular knowledge. Thus when revelation is received by man in the present state of valid knowledge it combines with the experience and worldview of the hearer. Thus theolougumena are not necessarily the element of binding dogma contained in the meaning of a statement, they are the intellectual frame of reference that is expressed with it. This position is so that the dogma can be understood more clearly. Ultimately joining man's history with man's historic knowledge of truth. In conclusion Theologoumenon is a belief or clarification by a group of the fathers and theologians of the Church upon a spiritual or theological matter that is not clearly communicated in the Scriptures or formulated in Church dogma as it is a work in progress. No theologoumenon can assert more than probability and it should not be accepted if it has been rejected by Church authority.

It belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin. The name is a derivative of the Visok mountain (1588 m) in Serbia through which it passes; the word is Slavic, derived from visoko (\\"high\\"), in the feminine form. Course The river begins at a height of 1640 m in the Berovo mountain, part of the Balkan Mountains, immediately east of the Serbia‚ÄìBulgaria border. The first kilometres are in river canyons (klisuri), and in the Bulgarian part (16,7 km long) the river receives several streams, the Kuratska, Krivi Potok, Gubeshka and Renovshtitsa. Near the village of Komshtitsa it creates a sharp angle and turns west, flowing into the Visok Valley, and after a few kilometres enters Serbia. The river enters Serbia near the village of Donji Krivodol. The Serbian part is ca. 54 km long. The river receives several streams and mountainous streamlets, of which the most notable are Rosomaƒçka and Dojkinaƒçka, ca. 40 km long. In this part, the river flows in a large basin, by several villages (Rsovci, Pakle≈°tica, Velika Lukanja, Zavoj). Beneath Zavoj, at the place of Mrtvi Most, the Visoƒçica flows into Tem≈°tica. In Serbia, the river forms the centre of the Visok region. A lavine in 1963 created the Zavoj Lake.

Her work mainly focused on ceramic sculpture. She was head of the ceramics department at Bezalel Academy of Art. She was a Holocaust survivor.  Early life  Lidia Zavadsky (originally Felicia Schindler) was born in 1937 in Drohobych, Poland (today Ukraine). When she was 2 years old her father was exiled to Siberia and later was recruited to the Red Army and his traces were lost. After the Nazi invasion she stayed with her mother in the Drohobycz ghetto. After the end of the ghetto they hid in a cellar for two years. Towards the end of World War II they were taken to Wroclaw, Poland. There her mother remarried and gave birth to her half-brother in 1946. In 1958 her family immigrated to Israel while she stayed in Poland. She graduated in law studies at the University of Wroc≈Çaw. After graduation she joined her family in 1961. In Israel she found difficulties in adapting and could not use her academic skills for employment. As a result, she worked in cleaning and soon felt discontented, turning to the Polish embassy to ask for a permit to return. There she met a young man Pyotr who came with the same purpose. They found support in each other and decided to stay in Israel and start a new career in art studies at the Bezalel Academy. Due to the lack of a sculpture studies department at Bezalel Academy, she opted to study in the ceramics department instead. During those days the department was focused on pottery. She supported her studies through cleaning the department's works, as well as restoring pottery at archaeological digs. In 1966 her elder daughter was born followed by her son in 1977.  Career  She excelled in her studies and after graduation she joined the department in 1965. In 1982 she was invited as guest lecturer for McGregor Art School at Toowoomba, In 1981 she published a book about Rakou techniques and working processes. She was later appointed professor at Bezalel Academy. In the same year she was guest lecturer for a series of workshops in Canada. In 1987 she was nominated to be the head of the ceramics department. During her years in Bezalel she transformed the department of ceramics from a department of pottery into an advocate of ceramic sculpture. Her art was characterized by deep intellectual curiosity and neverending experimentation with techniques, materials and ways of expression. She studied ancient traditional Chinese glazing methods of the Tang Dynasty in China and applied them to her art while creating human size jars in bright colors derived from lead. She won numerous grants and awards, among them the Sandberg Prize (1992). It was the first time ever that this prize was awarded to an artist in the ceramics medium. This prize enabled her to start her research and experimentation with ancient traditional Chinese glazes. Her last monumental work was a life-size realist sculpture in the image of a bright green donkey. it was displayed at the first Biennial of ceramics in Haaretz Museum and later she gifted it to the museum. This image was inspired by a donkey whom she cured and cared for in her back yard. As a consequence of using toxic lead for her art, Lidia developed cancer and died at age 64 in November 2001. Her works are kept in local and international public collections.

After being reprimanded by the boss for his bad behaviour towards the guests, he is warned that if he makes one mistake, he will be fired for good. Donald promises to be a better bellboy and remember that \\"the guest is always right\\". Just then, Pete and his son Pete Jr. arrive at the hotel. Remembering his promise, Donald goes out to greet them. However, Pete and his son slap and kick him and rip his uniform, which almost causes Donald to lose his temper. Pete and his son go to check into their rooms on the 80th floor. In the process, Pete Jr. constantly kicks and sabotages Donald, and causes him to lose his clothes in the elevator. Donald asks for them back, but Pete Jr. refuses. He finally returns them and offers to buy Donald a bottle of strawberry soda, but messes with the elevator to make it go up and down at super-speed, only stopping when Donald begs him too. Unfortunately for Pete Jr., he has finally pushed Donald too far, and the enraged duck proceeds to repeatedly spank him and drag him to the boss. Donald asks if he's fired; upon learning that he is, he pulls Pete Jr. behind a vase and continues spanking him, ending the cartoon with an evil laugh to the camera.
